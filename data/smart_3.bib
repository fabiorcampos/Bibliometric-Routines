Abstract = {{The Internet-of-Things (IoT) provides a great opportunity to many
   vertical industries because IoT interconnects various devices such as
   sensors and actuators and collects/processes data from them in order to
   improve services and reduce costs. As there exists many IoT technologies
   in the market, global standards and interworking mechanisms are critical
   to the success of the IoT. This article introduces standardized
   interworking interfaces and procedures based on one M2M global
   standards, and tests them through use cases involving multiple IoT
   service platforms. The interworking involves smart city
   applications/services running on multiple IoT service layer platforms
   interoperating with each other. The main purpose of the interworking
   experiment is to show how machine-to-machine (M2M)/IoT service providers
   are using one M2M compliant service layer platforms to deliver services
   more efficiently across multiple technology domains such as smart city.
   Because the deployment configurations of this interworking experiment
   span multiple domains, and the IoT devices and platforms are from
   different companies, we believe that this interworking experiment
   clearly proves that global IoT standards specifications can foster
   implementations of a service layer that enables services and
   interoperability between devices/device networks and cloud-based
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The extremely pervasive nature of mobile technologies, together with the
   user's need to continuously interact with her personal devices and to be
   always connected, strengthen the user-centric approach to design and
   develop new communication and computing solutions. Nowadays users not
   only represent the final utilizers of the technology, but they actively
   contribute to its evolution by assuming different roles: they act as
   humans, by sharing contents and experiences through social networks, and
   as virtual sensors, by moving freely in the environment with their
   sensing devices. Smart cities represent an important reference scenario
   for the active participation of users through mobile technologies. It
   involves multiple application domains and defines different levels of
   user engagement. Participatory sensing, opportunistic sensing, and
   mobile social networks (MSNs) currently represent some of the most
   promising people-centric paradigms. In addition, their integration can
   further improve the user involvement through new services and
   applications. In this article we present Smart-Citizen app, an MSN
   application designed in the framework of a smart city project to
   stimulate the active participation of citizens in generating and sharing
   useful contents related to the quality of life in their city. The app
   has been developed on top of a context-and social-aware middleware
   platform (CAMEO) able to integrate the main features of people-centric
   computing paradigms, lightening the app developer's effort. Existing
   middleware platforms generally focus on a single people-centric
   paradigm, exporting a limited set of features to mobile applications.
   CAMEO overcomes these limitations and, through Smart-Citizen, we
   highlight the advantages of implementing this type of mobile application
   in a smart city scenario. Experimental results shown in this article can
   also represent the technical guidelines for the development of
   heterogeneous people-centric mobile applications, embracing different
   application domains.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of the smart city industry and its effects on the
   national economy of Korea are investigated using input-output analysis.
   The definition and industrial classification of a smart city are
   established using the Delphi technique for experts in various fields,
   from information and communication technologies (ICT) to governmental
   policies for urban matters. The results of the analysis, including the
   production, value added and employment induction effects, show that the
   smart city industry has intermediate characteristics between ICT and
   urban construction industries, indicating that acquisition of the
   competitive edge of both the ICT and construction industries is the key
   to the success of the smart city industry. The crucial industries
   related to the smart city industry are identified based on an analysis
   of the forward and backward linkage effects, the results of which
   suggest the importance of the relevant service industries. The economic
   effects on the national economy induced by the governmental program for
   smart city demonstration are estimated using input-output analysis
   results. Overall, the results of this study indicate that facilitation
   of the smart city industry plays a key role not only in the sustainable

Abstract = {{Building energy efficiency and urban waste management are two focal
   issues for improving environmental status and reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions. The main aim of this paper is to compare economic costs of
   new building envelope structures designed by authors reusing and
   upcycling municipal waste in order to decrease energy demand from the
   building sector and, at the same time, improve eco-friendly waste
   management at the local scale. The reuse of waste for building envelope
   structures is one of the main principles of the Earthship buildings
   model, based on the use of passive solar principles in autonomous
   earth-sheltered homes. This Earthship principle has been analyzed in
   order to optimize buildings' energy performance and reuse municipal
   waste for new building envelope structures in urban areas. Indeed, the
   elaborated structures have been designed for urban contexts, with the
   aim of reuse waste coming from surrounding landfills. The methods
   include an analysis of thermal performance of urban waste for designing
   new building envelope structures realized by assembling waste and
   isolating materials not foreseen in Earthship buildings. The reused
   materials are: cardboard tubes, automobile tires, wood pallets, and
   plastic and glass bottles. Finally, comparing economic costs of these
   new building envelope structures, the obtained results highlight their
   economic feasibility compared to a traditional structure with similar
   thermal transmittance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the IES Cities platform conceived to streamline the
   development of urban apps that combine heterogeneous datasets provided
   by diverse entities, namely, government, citizens, sensor infrastructure
   and other information data sources. This work pursues the challenge of
   achieving effective citizen collaboration by empowering them to prosume
   urban data across time. Particularly, this paper focuses on the query
   mapper; a key component of the IES Cities platform devised to
   democratize the development of open data-based mobile urban apps. This
   component allows developers not only to use available data, but also to
   contribute to existing datasets with the execution of SQL sentences. In
   addition, the component allows developers to create ad hoc storages for
   their applications, publishable as new datasets accessible by other
   consumers. As multiple users could be contributing and using a dataset,
   our solution also provides a data level permission mechanism to control
   how the platform manages the access to its datasets. We have evaluated
   the advantages brought forward by IES Cities from the developers'
   perspective by describing an exemplary urban app created on top of it.
   In addition, we include an evaluation of the main functionalities of the

Abstract = {{Vehicular traffic congestion is a significant problem that arises in
   many cities. This is due to the increasing number of vehicles that are
   driving on city roads of limited capacity. The vehicular congestion
   significantly impacts travel distance, travel time, fuel consumption and
   air pollution. Avoidance of traffic congestion and providing drivers
   with optimal paths are not trivial tasks. The key contribution of this
   work consists of the developed approach for dynamic calculation of
   optimal traffic routes. Two attributes (the average travel speed of the
   traffic and the roads' length) are utilized by the proposed method to
   find the optimal paths. The average travel speed values can be obtained
   from the sensors deployed in smart cities and communicated to vehicles
   via the Internet of Vehicles and roadside communication units. The
   performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to three other
   algorithms: the simulated annealing weighted sum, the simulated
   annealing technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal
   solution and the Dijkstra algorithm. The weighted sum and technique for
   order preference by similarity to the ideal solution methods are used to
   formulate different attributes in the simulated annealing cost function.
   According to the Sheffield scenario, simulation results show that the
   improved simulated annealing technique for order preference by
   similarity to the ideal solution method improves the traffic performance
   in the presence of congestion by an overall average of 19.22\% in terms
   of travel time, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions as compared to other
   algorithms; also, similar performance patterns were achieved for the
   Birmingham test scenario.}},

Abstract = {{The recent release of standards for vehicular communications will hasten
   the development of smart cities in the following years. Many
   applications for vehicular networks, such as blocked road warnings or
   advertising, will require multi-hop dissemination of information to all
   vehicles in a region of interest. However, these networks present
   special features and difficulties that may require special measures. The
   dissemination of information may cause broadcast storms. Urban scenarios
   are especially sensitive to broadcast storms because of the high density
   of vehicles in downtown areas. They also present numerous crossroads and
   signal blocking due to buildings, which make dissemination more
   difficult than in open, almost straight interurban roadways. In this
   article, we discuss several options to avoid the broadcast storm problem
   while trying to achieve the maximum coverage of the region of interest.
   Specifically, we evaluate through simulations different ways to detect
   and take advantage of intersections and a strategy based on
   store-carry-forward to overcome short disconnections between groups of
   vehicles. Our conclusions are varied, and we propose two different
   solutions, depending on the requirements of the application.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) has made it possible for devices around the
   world to acquire information and store it, in order to be able to use it
   at a later stage. However, this potential opportunity is often not

   collection and the capability to process and analyse it. In this paper,
   we review the current IoT technologies, approaches and models in order
   to discover what challenges need to be met to make more sense of data.
   The main goal of this paper is to review the surveys related to IoT in
   order to provide well integrated and context aware intelligent services
   for IoT. Moreover, we present a state-of-the-art of IoT from the context
   aware perspective that allows the integration of IoT and social networks

Abstract = {{The evolution of Smart City projects is pushing researchers and

   efficient communication technologies. These communication technologies
   are the focus of this work, presenting a new routing algorithm based on
   dynamically-allocated sub-networks and node roles. Among these features,
   our algorithm presents a fast set-up time, a reduced overhead and a
   hierarchical organization, which allows for the application of complex
   management techniques. This work presents a routing algorithm based on a
   dynamically-allocated hierarchical clustering, which uses the link
   quality indicator as a reference parameter, maximizing the network
   coverage and minimizing the control message overhead and the convergence
   time. The present work based its test scenario and analysis in the
   density measure, considered as a node degree. The routing algorithm is
   compared with some of the most well known routing algorithms for

   within an Interoperable Coordination Platform in Smart Cities}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Smart subsystems like traffic, Smart Homes, the Smart Grid, outdoor
   lighting, etc. are built in many urban areas, each with a set of
   services that are offered to citizens. These subsystems are managed by
   self-contained embedded systems. However, coordination and cooperation
   between them are scarce. An integration of these systems which truly
   represents a ``system of systems{''} could introduce more benefits, such
   as allowing the development of new applications and collective
   optimization. The integration should allow maximum reusability of
   available services provided by entities (e.g., sensors or Wireless
   Sensor Networks). Thus, it is of major importance to facilitate the
   discovery and registration of available services and subsystems in an
   integrated way. Therefore, an ontology-based and automatic system for
   subsystem and service registration and discovery is presented. Using
   this proposed system, heterogeneous subsystems and services could be
   registered and discovered in a dynamic manner with additional semantic
   annotations. In this way, users are able to build customized
   applications across different subsystems by using available services.
   The proposed system has been fully implemented and a case study is
   presented to show the usefulness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing implies user collaboration and engagement, which fosters a
   renewal of city governance processes. In this article, we address a
   subset of crowdsourcing, named citizen-sourcing, where citizens interact
   with authorities collaboratively and actively. Many systems have
   experimented citizen-sourcing in city governance processes; however,
   their maturity levels are mixed. In order to focus on the service
   maturity, we introduce a city service maturity framework that contains
   five levels of service support and two levels of information
   integration. As an example, we introduce CITY FEED, which implements
   citizen-sourcing in city issue management process. In order to support
   such process, CITY FEED supports all levels of the maturity framework
   (publishing, transacting, interacting, collaborating, and evaluating)
   and integrates related information relationally and heterogeneously. In
   order to integrate heterogeneous information, it implements a threefold
   feed deduplication mechanism based on the geographic, text semantic, and
   image similarities of feeds. Currently, CITY FEED is in a pilot stage.}},

Abstract = {{In the near future, wireless networks will be one of the key
   technologies for road traffic management in smart cities. Vehicles and
   dedicated roadside units should be interconnected through wireless
   technologies such as IEEE 802.11p (WAVE). Traffic lights and road signs
   may also take their place in this architecture, forming a large-scale
   network of small devices that report measurements, take orders from a
   control center, and are able to take decisions autonomously based on
   their local perception. Such a network shares many similarities with
   classical wireless sensor and actuator networks, starting with its
   distributed organization and with the role of the control center.
   However, its topology, and, subsequently, the appropriate selection of
   protocols and algorithms, will be strongly influenced by each city's
   characteristics. In this paper, we characterize and discuss probable
   topologies of these networks. The aim of this work is to provide network
   models that can be used to evaluate protocols and algorithms using
   realistic scenarios in place of generic randomgraphs. We deploy such
   networks over 52 city maps extracted from OpenStreetMap and characterize
   the resulting graphs, with particular focus on the connectivity aspects
   (degree distribution and connected components). The tools, the complete
   data sets, and OMNeT++ network models are freely available online.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, city officials in Cagliari (Italy) have shown a
   particular interest in policies and strategies that promote sustainable
   urban mobility. The Urban Mobility Plan (Piano Urbana della Mobility),
   drafted in 2009, provides an important tool, transforming Cagliari's
   mobility in a smart direction by promoting alternative means of
   transport to the private vehicle. This paper describes a quantitative
   methodology for evaluating urban mobility in Cagliari, using a synthetic
   indicator, and suggests steps that Cagliari could take to meet
   international best practices for transportation. The data needed to
   analyse Cagliari's urban mobility are gathered, and the findings are
   compared to those from other comparable international cities. This
   intercity comparison allows the authors to consider how best to orient
   Cagliari's mobility towards international best practices. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{With a structurally entrenched digital divide on the one hand, and
   increasing ubiquity of the Internet in a techno-centric world on the
   other, the imperative to exploit information and knowledge for
   development remains a significant driver for equitable growth. It is
   posited that the silver-bullet for reducing this gap lies in increasing
   digital literacies within a society in order integrate segments who may
   be marginalized into the inclusive mainstream. In enabling greater and
   wider participation of digital citizens in their countries'
   socio-economic activities, the opportunities of a sustainable economy
   arise. This article is a study of ICT policies, applications and the
   resulting transformations in five mature economies committed to the
   vision of knowledge-based development with high levels of digital
   participation among their citizens. Specifically, using a
   multi-dimensional scorecard derived from prior work, we conduct a
   grounded theory investigation of how the five societies have applied
   digital literacies in knowledge-intensive public services such as
   education, healthcare and e-government, to derive best practices as well
   as lessons learned. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional urban planning methodologies cannot solve today's planning
   challenges that cities pose. Citizens' needs have substantially changed
   the last decade while urban planning methods have remained the same
   since the 70s. A more citizen-centric urban planning is presented in
   this paper. To that end, and to effectively deal with citizens' larger
   data needed for the urban planning methodological reinvention,
   interdisciplinary work is supported with information and communication
   technologies. We conducted a survey of citizens on urban time-use
   (Marsal MLl and Lopez MB (2014) Smart urban planning: Designing
   urban-land-use from urban time-use. Journal of Urban Technology 21(1):
   39-54). The results on urban-time-use distribution were converted into
   urban-land-uses as pioneering methodology for the reinvention of urban
   planning methodologies. In order to get the highest voluntary
   participation from citizens to ensure a good representation of all ages
   and social groups, the survey has to be designed with adaptive
   hypermedia techniques. The adaptive hypermedia techniques we propose in
   this paper combine stereotype and feature-based models which we explore
   for the purpose to include them in the survey. The combination of
   stereotype and feature-based models has different advantages, among
   others: stereotype techniques avoid to initiate survey profiles from
   scratch and feature-based techniques allow a personalized questionnaire
   to be employed. Moreover, personalization, in combination with user
   profiles, allows prediction which is of great interest for this research
   due to its planning purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental sustainability is one of the great challenges of the 21st
   century. A number of explanations have been advanced for why some local
   governments make strong commitments to sustainability while others do
   not. Most of the extant empirical research, however, has relied on
   models that employ only one or just a few of these explanations. As a
   result, empirical analyses do not encompass a comprehensive set of
   variables that account for alternative explanations. This study begins
   to fill this lacuna by specifying an empirical model that examines six
   explanations for local commitment towards sustainability: local
   sustainability priorities, regional governance, climate protection
   networks, interest group support, local fiscal capacity, and
   characteristics of the local governing institution. Moreover, we use the
   designation of human and financial resources specifically for
   sustainability to operationalise commitment. This is a more substantive
   measure than has been used in previous studies. We accomplish this by
   utilising data from the Integrated City Sustainability Database. Our
   results indicate that local priorities, participation in regional
   governance, and membership in climate protection networks influence the
   likelihood of cities' devotion of resources to sustainability. We
   discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice.}},

   conducted on four types residential consumers obtained in the summer for
   some residential houses located in the centre of Tehran city in Iran:
   first with time of use pricing, second with real-time pricing, third one
   with critical peak pricing, and the last consumer had no tariff for

Abstract = {{The smart city is often approached by its critics as a system that
   exploits optimal connectivity and efficiency for an urban society of

   focusing on the interplays between these dualities, this article aims to
   underscore the modalities of power and political possibilities of
   dissent in Istanbul, Turkey. Data-based smart city apparatuses are
   supposed to at once fix infrastructural breakdown and stabilize the
   socio-political order. However, during the Gezi protests of 2013, the
   integrated tactics of sabotage in urban space and data vandalism in the
   digital realm undermined both data control by the state and its
   political authority. Yet Gezi's example also shows that
   hyperconnectivity, data motility, and virality by themselves do not
   necessarily lead to more meaningful participation in urban politics.}},

   machine hearing classification using spectrogram features}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{119-128}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Machine hearing is an emerging research field that is analogous to
   machine vision in that it aims to equip computers with the ability to
   hear and recognise a variety of sounds. It is a key enabler of natural
   human-computer speech interfacing, as well as in areas such as automated
   security surveillance, environmental monitoring, smart
   homes/buildings/cities. Recent advances in machine learning allow
   current systems to accurately recognise a diverse range of sounds under
   controlled conditions. However doing so in real-world noisy conditions
   remains a challenging task. Several front-end feature extraction methods
   have been used for machine hearing, employing speech recognition
   features like MFCC and PLP, as well as image-like features such as AIM
   and SIF. The best choice of feature is found to be dependent upon the
   noise environment and machine learning techniques used. Machine learning
   methods such as deep neural networks have been shown capable of
   inferring discriminative classification rules from less structured
   front-end features in related domains. In the machine hearing field,
   spectrogram image features have recently shown good performance for
   noise-corrupted classification using deep neural networks. However there
   are many methods of extracting features from spectrograms. This paper
   explores a novel data-driven feature extraction method that uses
   variance-based criteria to define spectral pooling of features from
   spectrograms. The proposed method, based on maximising the pooled
   spectral variance of foreground and background sound models, is shown to
   achieve very good performance for robust classification. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Renewable Energy Sources (RES) plants still have to operate at their
   maximum possible output and are therefore independent of electric energy
   consumption. Thus, coordination between distributed generators, energy
   storage systems and flexible loads is expected to add a great value to
   grid operations and facilitate further RES penetration. The increasing
   penetration of bus communication technologies into buildings and their
   control possibilities over electric energy consumption may also make
   valuable contributions to the grid operation. Thus, the control system
   of the future grid should be compatible to smart buildings and cities.
   This paper presents a control system of an experimental microgrid which
   is made compatible to bus communication technologies at the demand-side,
   by applying a simple technique. The proposed technique does not require
   additional interface or software tools, as other methods do and
   therefore is a cost-effective method and can be easily expanded and used
   for demand-side management in future smart grids. Experimental results
   prove that bus communication technologies could contribute to the
   voltage regulation as well as to the application of efficient energy
   management policies of microgrid-based smart grid topologies. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Do positive messages regarding the benefits of increased housing density
   influence resident stated housing development preferences? We employ an
   experimental research design to test the efficacy of positive messages
   regarding increased housing density to reduce observed NIMBYism (Not In
   My Back Yard). Using a survey-based experiment, we compared four
   messages: a notification of the public benefits; the private benefits; a
   social comparison drawing on expert knowledge of housing preferences;
   and a control stating recent trends in the municipality. Our sample of
   202 residents of a mid-sized Canadian city indicates that messages
   regarding the public benefits of increased density reduced NIMBYism by
   four times the control message. We find some evidence in favor of the
   efficacy of the social comparison treatment as well. We discuss these
   findings with reference to the literature on smart city growth, and the
   policy implications that emerge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Understanding the controllability of complex networks continues to gain
   traction across disciplinary fields, including the exploration of
   infrastructure systems such as power grids. Through topological
   principles, this paper investigates the controllability features of an
   ensemble of 58 U.S. city-level power transmission networks in seven U.S.
   states. To perform structural controllability analyses, the topological
   characteristics of the ensemble of networks are first quantified,
   including degree, shortest path length, clustering coefficient,
   meshedness and betweenness centrality, as well as the uncertainty
   associated with these and related properties. Then, the paper focuses on
   the controllability features of complex networks so as to detect the
   minimal sets of driver nodes to possibly control the networks given
   system linearity assumptions. Accordingly, a node is critical,
   intermittent or redundant if it acts as a driver node in all, some, or
   none of the potentially controllable system configurations. Moreover,
   this paper constructs a new methodology to quantify the probability of
   being a driver node among the intermittent nodes, and reveals the
   controllability importance of system components. Results show that a
   small proportion of driver nodes can provide the conditions for
   controlling the slow dynamics of entire power transmission networks from
   a topological perspective, despite variations in network sizes and
   configurations. This paper also reveals that the driver nodes tend to
   avoid high degree nodes and high triangulation sub-graph nodes as well
   as high betweenness centrality nodes. The identification of topological
   differences for different categories of nodes (critical, intermittent or
   redundant) could help researchers and utilities understand the
   conditions for future functional controllability of power networks while
   improving their reliability and resilience as well as facilitating their
   transition into smart grid systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   using Big Data analytics}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{63-80}},
Month = {{JUN 4}},
Abstract = {{The rapid growth in the population density in urban cities demands that
   services and an infrastructure be provided to meet the needs of city
   inhabitants. Thus, there has been an increase in the request for
   embedded devices, such as sensors, actuators, and smartphones, leading
   to considerable business potential for the new era of the Internet of
   Things (IoT), in which all devices are capable of interconnecting and
   communicating with each other over the Internet. Thus, Internet
   technologies provide a way of integrating and sharing a common
   communication medium. With this knowledge, in this paper, we propose a
   combined IoT-based system for smart city development and urban planning
   using Big Data analytics. We propose a complete system consisting of
   various types of sensor deployment, including smart home sensors,
   vehicular networking, weather and water sensors, smart parking sensors,
   and surveillance objects. A four-tier architecture is proposed that
   includes 1) Bottom tier-1, which is responsible for IoT sources and data
   generation and collection, 2) Intermediate tier-1, which is responsible
   for all types of communication between, for instance, sensors, relays,
   base stations, and the Internet, 3) Intermediate tier 2, which is
   responsible for data management and processing using a Hadoop framework,
   and 4) Top tier, which is responsible for application and usage of the
   data analysis and the results generated. The system implementation
   consists of various steps that begin with data generation and move to
   collection, aggregation, filtration, classification, preprocessing,
   computing and decision making. The proposed system is implemented using
   Hadoop with Spark, voltDB, Storm or S4 for real time processing of the
   IoT data to generate results to establish the smart city. For urban
   planning or city future development, the offline historical data are
   analyzed with Hadoop using MapReduce programming. IoT datasets generated
   by smart homes, smart parking weather, pollution, and vehicle data sets
   are used for analysis and evaluation. This type of system with full
   functionality does not currently exist. Similarly, the results
   demonstrate that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient than
   existing systems. Moreover, system efficiency is measured in terms of
   throughput and processing time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are significant goals for
   many cities. Many promote ``smart growth{''} development patterns aimed
   in part at reducing energy use and emissions. However, while citizens
   may endorse broad energy-mitigation policies, they often resist the
   implementation of such policies via smart growth and other mitigation
   initiatives in their own neighborhoods. This study looked at whether
   public understanding and acceptance of smart-growth policies could be
   improved if citizens were provided with timely, accessible
   visualizations about why and how such policies can help reduce energy
   use. This paper reviews two public-engagement workshops that utilized a
   collaborative touch table combined with three-dimensional visualizations
   and metrics that were updated in real time. Working both individually
   and collaboratively on an urban-design task, all participants improved
   the smart growth and energy-related performance of the study areas via
   their solutions in the first workshop, but they did not all further
   improve the energy-related performance of the areas after receiving
   additional energy knowledge and metrics in a follow-up workshop.
   Participants responded favorably to the medium and to the collaborative
   learning it enabled.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides a definition for urban big data while exploring its
   features and applications of China's city intelligence. The differences
   between city intelligence in China and the ``smart city{''} concept in
   other countries are compared to highlight and contrast the unique
   definition and model for China's city intelligence in this paper.
   Furthermore, this paper examines the role of urban big data in city
   intelligence by showing that it not only serves as the cornerstone of
   this trend as it also plays a core role in the diffusion of city
   intelligence technology and serves as an inexhaustible resource for the
   sustained development of city intelligence. This study also points out
   the challenges of shaping and developing of China's urban big data.
   Considering the supporting and core role that urban big data plays in
   city intelligence, the study then expounds on the key points of urban
   big data, including infrastructure support, urban governance, public
   services, and economic and industrial development. Finally, this study
   points out that the utility of city intelligence as an ideal policy tool
   for advancing the goals of China's urban development. In conclusion, it
   is imperative that China make full use of its unique
   advantages-including using the nation's current state of development and
   resources, geographical advantages, and good human relations-in
   subjective and objective conditions to promote the development of city
   intelligence through the proper application of urban big data. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Whether it be Smart Cities, Ambient Intelligence, or the Internet of
   Things, current visions for future urban spaces share a common core,
   namely the increasing role of distributed sensor networks and the
   on-demand integration of their data to power real-time services and
   analytics. Some of the greatest hurdles to implementing these visions
   include security risks, user privacy, scalability, the integration of
   heterogeneous data, and financial cost. In this work, we propose a
   crowdsensing mobile-device platform that empowers citizens to collect
   and share information about their surrounding environment via embedded
   sensor technologies. This approach allows a variety of urban areas
   (e.g., university campuses, shopping malls, city centers, suburbs) to
   become equipped with a free ad-hoc sensor network without depending on
   proprietary instrumentation. We present a framework, namely the
   GeoTracer application, as a proof-of-concept to conduct multiple
   experiments simulating use-case scenarios on a university campus. First,
   we demonstrate that ambient sensors (e.g. temperature, pressure,
   humidity, magnetism, illuminance, and audio) can help determine a change
   in environment (e.g. moving from indoors to outdoors, or floor changes
   inside buildings) more accurately than typical positioning technologies
   (e.g. global navigation satellite system, Wi-Fi, etc.). Furthermore,
   each of these sensors contributes a different amount of data to
   detecting events. for example, illuminance has the highest information
   gain when trying to detect changes between indoors and outdoors. Second,
   we show that through this platform it is possible to detect and
   differentiate place types on a university campus based on inferences
   made through ambient sensors. Lastly, we train classifiers to determine
   the activities that a place can afford at different times (e.g. good for
   studying or not, basketball courts in use or empty) based on
   sensor-driven semantic signatures.}},

Abstract = {{The wisdom of developmental activities that propose voluminous increase
   in the built infrastructure is questionable. These can seriously
   undermine the ability of quintessential small cities to retain the
   sociocultural and people centric character leading to a saner lifestyle
   in comparison to the burgeoning metros. This study is based in Nagpur, a
   Grade II city of central India. It presents a comparative analysis of
   three unique housing neighbourhoods developed in distinct temporal
   periods: historic, pre-globalisation, and post-globalisation. It focuses
   upon seminal parameters that are intrinsic to emotional well-being of
   residents and encourage positive behavioural responses. The methodology
   follows a qualitative approach through a study of morphological maps,
   non-participatory observation, and photo documentation. An argument is
   developed for a comprehensive urban development process, based upon
   respect for intrinsic sociocultural values. It emphasises the need to
   celebrate and rejuvenate the thread of continuum for betterment of small
   cities. This enquiry resolves that to make a city smart and sustainable,
   efforts at people centricity are imperative along with ICT and other
   smart technologies of the future.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{66-80}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper broadens the research on weather and public transport usage
   by considering the micro dynamics of the effect that various weather
   conditions impose on micro geographic patterns of bus ridership in
   Brisbane, Australia. A smart card data set and detailed measurements of
   weather, allied with a suite of statistical and visual analytic
   techniques, are employed to capture the effect of weather on the local
   variations of bus ridership. While changes in weather conditions do not
   significantly affect bus ridership at the system level, some marked
   influence was found for rainfall, wind speed and relative humidity at a
   sub-system level. In addition, discernible variations of both the
   magnitude and direction of weather's effect were found at the sub-system
   level. Developing a more geographically detailed understanding of the
   effect of weather on public transport services serves as a critical
   first step towards establishing a more weather-resilient public
   transport system. This new understanding has the potential to contribute
   to an evidence base that can be used to proactively adjust public
   transport services in response to changes in weather conditions across
   different parts of the network. Further research is needed to assess how
   transferable our findings are to other public transport and climatic
   contexts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article focuses on the development of the Czechoslovak `rychla
   tramvaj' ('fast tram') systems in Prague, Bratislava and Brno. Its aim
   is to examine whether these systems meet the requirements of light rail
   and whether it is possible to continue their development as a functional
   light rail city transport system. A further aim is a detailed analysis
   of the conditions and contexts affecting the gradual development of
   `rychla tramvaj' schemes in three selected metropolises in the former
   Czechoslovakia.
   Urban development in Czechoslovakia was affected by the socialist
   planning system that constructed large housing estates on the edges of
   metropolises during the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, many commuters had
   to be moved between them and city centres daily; therefore, the
   necessity for high-capacity `rychla tramvaj' connections became
   apparent. After socio-political changes in 1989, a market economy was
   introduced and the trends of commercial and residential suburbanization
   have modified the spatial structure of the cities, and mobility has
   begun to be increasingly dependent on cars. In response to this, city
   councils departed from further development of `rychla tramvaj' schemes.
   Currently, the emphasis on sustainable mobility is apparent principally
   because of smart city solutions, an environmental focus and a common
   European transport policy; thus, municipalities are rediscovering the
   virtues of light rail lines again. Because the `rychla tramvaj' systems
   from the 1970s and 1980s are still in operation, transforming them into
   modem light rail systems appears to be a convenient and cheap solution.

Abstract = {{Smart transportation, which is an important dimension of smart cities,
   includes both intelligent and ``green{''} transportation solutions.
   Cycling, as one of the most sustainable forms of transportation, is and
   should be an important component of smart cities. Electric bicycles,
   which are the most popular electric vehicles, subscribe to this type of
   transportation. They have several advantages when compared with
   traditional bicycles but have issues that relate to battery-limited
   capacity and long periods of charging as well. Consequently,
   energy-efficient solutions for electric bicycles are of very high
   research interest. Research on vehicular-communications-based
   energy-efficient solutions for electric vehicles is still in the early
   stages. Among electric vehicles, electric bicycles distinguish
   themselves as a special class as they have different characteristics and
   road-related requirements. This paper proposes a novel
   vehicular-communications-based speed advisory system for electric
   bicycles. The solution recommends strategic riding (i.e., the
   appropriate speed) when bicycles are approaching a signaled intersection
   to avoid high-power-consumption scenarios. The proposed approach
   includes a fuzzylogic-based wind-aware speed adaptation policy, as,
   among all the other vehicles, bicycles are mostly affected by wind.
   Experimental results based on a real testbed and extensive
   simulation-based testing demonstrate that, by using the proposed
   solution, significant energy savings are recorded. In addition, an
   analysis on comfort-related metrics shows that the proposed solution can
   also contribute to improving the cycling experience.}},

Abstract = {{To realize the sustainable energy supply in a smart city, it is
   essential to maximize energy scavenging from the city environments for
   achieving the self-powered functions of some intelligent devices and
   sensors. Although the solar energy can be well harvested by using
   existing technologies, the large amounts of wasted wind energy in the
   city cannot be effectively utilized since conventional wind turbine
   generators can only be installed in remote areas due to their large
   volumes and safety issues. Here, we rationally design a hybridized
   nanogenerator, including a solar cell (SC) and a triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG), that can individually/simultaneously scavenge
   solar and wind energies, which can be extensively installed on the roofs
   of the city buildings. Under the same device area of about 120 mm X 22
   mm, the SC can deliver a largest output power of about 8 mW, while the
   output power of the TENG can be up to 26 mW. Impedance matching between
   the SC and TENG has been achieved by using a transformer to decrease the
   impedance of the TENG. The hybridized nanogenerator has a larger output
   current and a better charging performance than that of the individual SC
   or TENG. This research presents a feasible approach to maximize solar
   and wind energies scavenging from the city environments with the aim to
   realize some self-powered functions in smart city.}},

Title = {{A Novel Location-Centric IoT-Cloud Based On-Street Car Parking Violation
   Management System in Smart Cities}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, in big cities, parking management is a critical issue from
   both the driver's side and the city government's side. From the driver's
   side, how to find an available parking lot in a city is a considerable
   concern. As a result, smart parking systems recently have received great
   interest, both in academia and industry. From the city government's
   side, how to manage and distribute such a limited public parking
   resource efficiently to give every visitor a fair chance of finding an
   on-street parking lot is also a considerable concern. However, existing
   studies of smart parking management focus only on assisting the driver's
   side to find available parking spaces. This study aims to raise a new
   perspective on such smart parking management and to propose a novel
   location-centric IoT-cloud-based parking violation management system.
   The system is designed to assist authoritative officers in finding
   parking violations easily and recommends the least cost path for
   officers so that officers can achieve their highest productivity in
   finding parking violations and issuing parking tickets. Experimental
   results show that the system not only improves the productivity of
   officers in finding parking violations and issuing tickets, but also
   helps reduce the traveling cost of officers and to reduce the average
   violation period of violating cars considerably.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In many countries around the world, smart cities are becoming a reality.
   These cities contribute to improving citizens' quality of life by
   providing services that are normally based on data extracted from
   wireless sensor networks (WSN) and other elements of the Internet of
   Things. Additionally, public administration uses these smart city data
   to increase its efficiency, to reduce costs and to provide additional
   services. However, the information received at smart city data centers
   is not always accurate, because WSNs are sometimes prone to error and
   are exposed to physical and computer attacks. In this article, we use
   real data from the smart city of Barcelona to simulate WSNs and
   implement typical attacks. Then, we compare frequently used anomaly
   detection techniques to disclose these attacks. We evaluate the
   algorithms under different requirements on the available network status
   information. As a result of this study, we conclude that one-class
   Support Vector Machines is the most appropriate technique. We achieve a
   true positive rate at least 56\% higher than the rates achieved with the
   other compared techniques in a scenario with a maximum false positive
   rate of 5\% and a 26\% higher in a scenario with a false positive rate
   of 15\%.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Connecting vehicles securely and reliably is pivotal to the
   implementation of next generation ITS applications of smart cities. With
   continuously growing security threats, vehicles could be exposed to a
   number of service attacks that could put their safety at stake. To
   address this concern, both US and European ITS standards have selected
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms to secure vehicular
   communications. However, there is still a lack of benchmarking studies
   on existing security standards in real-world settings. In this paper, we
   first analyze the security architecture of the ETSI ITS standard. We
   then implement the ECC based digital signature and encryption procedures
   using an experimental test-bed and conduct an extensive benchmark study
   to assess their performance which depends on factors such as payload
   size, processor speed and security levels. Using network simulation
   models, we further evaluate the impact of standard compliant security
   procedures in dense and realistic smart cities scenarios. Obtained
   results suggest that existing security solutions directly impact the
   achieved quality of service (QoS) and safety awareness of vehicular
   applications, in terms of increased packet inter-arrival delays, packet
   and cryptographic losses, and reduced safety awareness in safety
   applications. Finally, we summarize the insights gained from the
   simulation results and discuss open research challenges for efficient
   working of security in ITS applications of smart cities.}},

Title = {{Energy Efficient IoT Data Collection in Smart Cities Exploiting D2D
   Communications}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fifth Generation (5G) wireless systems are expected to connect an
   avalanche of ``smart{''} objects disseminated from the largest ``Smart
   City{''} to the smallest ``Smart Home{''}. In this vision, Long Term
   Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) is deemed to play a fundamental role in the
   Internet of Things (IoT) arena providing a large coherent infrastructure
   and a wide wireless connectivity to the devices. However, since LTE-A
   was originally designed to support high data rates and large data size,
   novel solutions are required to enable an efficient use of radio
   resources to convey small data packets typically exchanged by IoT
   applications in ``smart{''} environments. On the other hand, the
   typically high energy consumption required by cellular communications is
   a serious obstacle to large scale IoT deployments under cellular
   connectivity as in the case of Smart City scenarios. Network-assisted
   Device-to-Device (D2D) communications are considered as a viable
   solution to reduce the energy consumption for the devices. The
   particular approach presented in this paper consists in appointing one
   of the IoT smart devices as a collector of all data from a cluster of
   objects using D2D links, thus acting as an aggregator toward the eNodeB.
   By smartly adapting the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) on the
   communication links, we will show it is possible to maximize the radio
   resource utilization as a function of the total amount of data to be
   sent. A further benefit that we will highlight is the possibility to
   reduce the transmission power when a more robust MCS is adopted. A
   comprehensive performance evaluation in a wide set of scenarios will
   testify the achievable gains in terms of energy efficiency and resource
   utilization in the envisaged D2D-based IoT data collection.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of new generation technology and the low-carbon
   economy, the smart low-carbon city has become one of the academic
   hotspots. Many studies on it have begun; however, the dynamic mechanism
   is rarely involved. Therefore, this paper uses the Technique for Order
   Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to
   creatively take a quantitative study on a Chinese smart low-carbon
   city's dynamic mechanism. The results show that: (1) the three main
   dynamics of smart low-carbon city development in China are institutional
   and cultural conditions, facilities and functions conditions and economy
   and industry conditions, but the overall utility is relatively low; (2)
   the level of the dynamic operation mechanism of the Chinese smart
   low-carbon city is distinct between regions, indicating a diminishing
   spatial law from east to west and differences within regions; (3) the
   imbalance of the comprehensive dynamic mechanism and the operation
   status between smart low-carbon cities is prominent, showing a
   decreasing urban scale law of from big to small and differences within
   each scale, and a descending administration hierarchy law from high to
   low and differences within each class; (4) seven basic development
   patterns can be obtained, and most of the cities belong to the external
   strong/internal weak mode, which basically matches with its development
   realities. Finally, general policy recommendations and countermeasures
   of optimization and improvement are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the authors reveal the first-of-its-kind method for the
   design of truly smart city projects and the elaboration of smarter urban
   planning. The Intelligenter Method is based on the innovative idea of
   collaborations discovery in urban systems. The Intelligenter Method
   shows that what makes an urban project or a plan smart is not its
   sophisticated architecture or complex master planning in a technological
   environment, but rather qualitative and quantitative collaborations that
   the urban subsystem being planned or projected can establish with
   related subsystems, to safeguard sustainability while promoting urban
   development and improving resilience. The authors of this research are
   now sharing with the research community the Method they developed to
   teach intelligenter smart urban planning and projecting. This Method is
   also applicable to intelligenter urban policy making and regulation
   drafting. This second part of the methodology is published in a separate
   paper in this Cities issue with the title ``The Intelligenter Method
   (II) for `smarter' urban policy-making and regulation drafting{''}. (C)

Abstract = {{Academic attention to smart cities and their governance is growing
   rapidly, but the fragmentation in approaches makes for a confusing
   debate. This article brings some structure to the debate by analyzing a
   corpus of 51 publications and mapping their variation. The analysis
   shows that publications differ in their emphasis on (1) smart
   technology, smart people or smart collaboration as the defining features
   of smart cities, (2) a transformative or incremental perspective on
   changes in urban governance, (3) better outcomes or a more open process
   as the legitimacy claim for smart city governance. We argue for a
   comprehensive perspective: smart city governance is about crafting new
   forms of human collaboration through the use of ICTs to obtain better
   outcomes and more open governance processes. Research into smart city
   governance could benefit from previous studies into success and failure
   factors for e-government and build upon sophisticated theories of
   socio-technical change. This article highlights that smart city
   governance is not a technological issue: we should study smart city
   governance as a complex process of institutional change and acknowledge
   the political nature of appealing visions of socio-technical governance.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and pervasive and
   ubiquitous computing provide a glimpse into the future of our planet and
   reveal exciting visions of many smart things: smart cities, smart homes,
   smart cars, and other smart spaces such as malls, workplaces, hotels,
   schools, and much more. Driven by a technological revolution offering
   ``low-power many things and wireless almost everything,{''} we could, in
   only a decade, envision and prototype impressive smart space systems
   that improve quality of life, enhance awareness of resources and the
   environment, and enrich users' experience. However, prototyping is one
   thing and actual large-scale deployments are another. The massive scale
   of sensors and devices that will be deployed in smart cities of the
   future will be challenging. Without an ecosystem and a scalable
   architecture in place, it will be extremely difficult to manage or
   program such an expanding and massive IoT. In this paper, we introduce
   the Cloud-Edge-Beneath (CEB) architecture and present its salient

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Wearable and mobile devices are widely used for crowdsensing, as they
   come with many sensors and are carried everywhere. Among the sensing
   data, videos annotated with temporal-spatial metadata contain huge
   amount of information, but consume too much precious storage space. In
   this paper, we solve the problem of optimizing cloud-based video
   crowdsensing in three steps. First, we study the optimal transcoding
   problem on wearable and mobile cameras. We propose an algorithm to
   optimally select the coding parameters to fit more videos at higher
   quality on wearable and mobile cameras. Second, we empirically
   investigate the throughput of different file transfer protocols from
   wearable and mobile devices to cloud servers. We propose a real-time
   algorithm to select the best protocol under diverse network conditions,
   so as to leverage the intermittent WiFi access. Last, we look into the
   performance of cloud databases for sensor-annotated videos, and
   implement a practical algorithm to search videos overlapping with a
   target geographical region. Our measurement study on three popular
   opensource cloud databases reveals their pros and cons. The three
   proposed algorithms are evaluated via extensive simulations and
   experiments. The evaluation results show the practicality and efficiency
   of our algorithms and system. For example, our proposed transcoding
   algorithm outperforms existing approaches by 12 dB in video quality,
   87\% in energy saving, and one-quarter in delivery delay. Another
   example is, by intelligently choosing a proper cloud database, our
   system may reduce the insertion time by up to one-third, or the lookup
   time by up to one-fourth.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, building energy consumption has increased in response
   to climate change, resulting in a worldwide reduction of energy
   efficiency. A strong response is required, through both the enhancement
   of building energy efficiency and the reduction of power usage. These
   objectives could be achieved by pursuing ``Blackout{''} prevention,
   through developing a control unit such as that of the urban energy grid
   system that was used in the Energy Operation Center (EOC) for smart
   cities. In this context, this paper presents an optimization operation
   technique for Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS), using control
   monitor-based Building Information Modeling (BIM) for the efficient
   operation of the EOC. BIM is one of the approaches that can be used for
   the visual representation, management, and exchange of information on
   all aspects of a building. The EOC should be able to efficiently
   represent the data from the building information, and the operator
   maintaining it should be able to promptly acquire the data for handling
   it. This suggests that the control of energy consumption by a Building
   Automation System (BAS) to maximize building energy efficiency will lead
   to improved total energy performance, reduced operating costs, and
   reduced environmental impact.}},

Abstract = {{Solid waste collection systems are very important in today's urban

   running costs. As an alternative, a smart solid waste collection system
   with all subcomponents was developed and applied in a small city in
   Turkey. In addition to the conventional waste collection systems, this

Abstract = {{Rapid urban population growth and the associated expansion of urban
   areas in China (as elsewhere) present significant environmental
   challenges and threaten urban and regional ecological security. Modeling
   land use changes is one way to aid the management of cities. Using
   remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) software
   platforms, land use data for the years 1989, 1996, 2004, and 2010 for
   the area inside the Jinan third ring road were interpreted. An urban
   green space network was developed, as a core strategy to ensure
   landscape ecological security, and subjected to ecological sensitivity
   analysis. The green space network and the result of the ecological
   sensitivity analysis were integrated into the exclusion/attraction layer
   of an existing cellular automaton model: slope, land use,
   exclusion/attraction, urban extent, transportation, and hillshade
   (SLEUTH). A development scenario for land use change was constructed
   that integrates these landscape ecological security development (LESD)
   strategies and reveals trends in urban growth for the different
   development scenarios between 2011 and 2040. The results of the LESD
   scenario were compared with those from two other development scenarios:
   the historical trend development (HTD) and the transit-oriented
   development (TOD). The study revealed three significant findings. First,
   change in the urban area in the study will be dominated by urban edge
   growth and transit-oriented development, while spontaneous growth and
   cluster growth were not obvious. Second, the growth rate of built-up
   land in the urban area in all three scenarios exhibits emerging trends.
   The growth rate, according to the LESD scenario, is significantly lower
   than those for the HTD and TOD scenarios, and encroachment into natural
   ecological space (such as woodlands, water, and agricultural land) is
   less than those in the other two scenarios. This result indicates that
   the LESD scenario can protect natural ecological spaces effectively and
   can significantly reduce the ecological security risk. This aligns with
   the integration of smart growth and smart conservation. Third,
   integrating LESD into the SLEUTH model results in the ability to
   evaluate urban development policies and can help characterize
   development strategies for urban landscape ecological security. The
   results of this study provide reference data and a basis for decision
   making for the future management of urban growth, urban planning, and
   land use planning. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{With gigabit networking becoming economically feasible and widely
   installed at homes, there are new opportunities to revisit in-home,
   personalized telehealth services. In this paper, we describe a novel
   telehealth eldercare service that we developed viz., ``Physical
   Therapy-as-a-Service'' (PTaaS) that connects a remote physical therapist
   at a clinic to a senior at home. The service leverages a high-speed,
   low-latency network connection through an interactive interface built on
   top of Microsoft Kinect motion sensing capabilities. The interface that
   is built using user-centered design principles for wellness coaching
   exercises is essentially a `Synchronous Big Data' application due to
   its: (i) high data-in-motion velocity (i.e., peak data rate is
   approximate to 400 Mbps), (ii) considerable variety (i.e., measurements
   include 3D sensing, network health, user opinion surveys and video clips
   of RGB, skeletal and depth data), and (iii) large volume (i.e., several
   GB of measurement data for a simple exercise activity). The successful
   PTaaS delivery through this interface is dependent on the veracity
   analytics needed for correlation of the real-time Big Data streams
   within a session, in order to assess exercise balance of the senior
   without any bias due to network quality effects. Our experiments with
   PTaaS in an actual testbed involving senior homes in Kansas City with
   Google Fiber connections and our university clinic demonstrate the
   network configuration and time synchronization related challenges in
   order to perform online analytics. Our findings provide insights on how
   to: (a) enable suitable resource calibration and perform network
   troubleshooting for high user experience for both the therapist and the
   senior, and (b) realize a Big Data architecture for PTaaS and other
   similar personalized healthcare services to be remotely delivered at a
   large-scale in a reliable, secure and cost-effective manner. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Urban pluvial flood are attracting growing public concern due to rising
   intense precipitation and increasing consequences. Accurate risk
   assessment is critical to an efficient urban pluvial flood management,
   particularly in transportation sector. This paper describes an
   integrated methodology, which initially makes use of high resolution 2D
   inundation modeling and flood depth-dependent measure to evaluate the
   potential impact and risk of pluvial flash flood on road network in the
   city center of Shanghai, China. Intensity-Duration-Frequency
   relationships of Shanghai rainstorm and Chicago Design Storm are
   combined to generate ensemble rainfall scenarios. A hydrodynamic model
   (FloodMap-HydroInundation2D) is used to simulate overland flow and flood
   inundation for each scenario. Furthermore, road impact and risk
   assessment are respectively conducted by a new proposed algorithm and
   proxy. Results suggest that the flood response is a function of
   spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation and local characteristics
   (i.e. drainage and topography), and pluvial flash flood is found to lead
   to proportionate but nonlinear impact on intra-urban road inundation
   risk. The approach tested here would provide more detailed flood
   information for smart management of urban street network and may be
   applied to other big cities where road flood risk is evolving in the
   context of climate change and urbanization. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Virtual code resource allocation for energy-aware MTC access over 5G

Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{The enormous traffic of machine-type communications (MTC) expected over
   5G exacerbates the limitations of access schemes currently under
   investigation in the literature. This scenario becomes more challenging
   when considering smart city environments, which introduce further issues
   due to the heterogeneity in the level of residual battery energy of
   involved machines. Novel solutions are, therefore, required, which aim
   at drastically reducing the collision probability of devices with
   critical level of residual battery energy. In this paper, we propose a
   virtual code resource allocation (VCRA) approach which extends the
   code-expanded strategy to support a high number of devices
   simultaneously accessing the system. Besides, a virtual resource
   allocation scheme to guarantee energy-priority in the access procedure
   is introduced. The idea behind our proposal is the definition of
   different access levels that exploit disjoint sets of access codewords,
   properly tailored to guarantee high capacity for each access level.
   Simulation results show to the effectiveness of our scheme in terms of
   (i) reducing the collision probability of machines with limited battery
   capabilities also in scenarios with very high cell load and (ii)
   enhancing the efficiency with respect to legacy code-expanded strategy.

Abstract = {{In smart cities, cellular network plays a crucial role to support
   wireless access for numerous devices anywhere and anytime. The future 5G
   network aims to build the infrastructure from mobile internet to
   connected world. Small Cell is one of the most promising technologies of
   5G to provide more connections and high data rate. In order to make the
   best use of small cell technology, smart cell planning should be
   implemented to guarantee connectivity and performance for all end nodes.
   It is particularly a challenging task to deploy dense small cells in the
   presence of dynamic traffic demands and severe co-channel interference.
   In this paper, we model various traffic patterns using stochastic
   geometry approach and propose an energy-efficient scheme to deploy and
   plan small cells according to the prevailing traffic pattern. The
   simulation results indicate that our scheme can meet dynamic traffic
   demands with optimized deployment of small cells and enhance the energy
   efficiency of the system without compromising on quality-of-service
   (QoS) requirements. In addition, our scheme can achieve very close
   performance compared with the leading optimization solver CPLEX and find
   solutions in much less computational times than CPLEX. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{How to deliver data to, or collect data from the hundreds of thousands
   of sensors and actuators integrated in ``things{''} spread across
   virtually every smart city streets (garbage cans, storm drains,
   advertising panels, etc.)? The answer to the question is neither
   straightforward nor unique, given the scale of the issue, the lack of a
   single administrative entity for such tiny devices (arguably run by a
   multiplicity of distinct and independent service providers), and the
   cost and power concerns that their direct connectivity to the cellular
   network might pose. This paper posits that one possible alternative
   consists in connecting such devices to their data collection gateways
   using ``oblivious data mules{''}, namely transport fleets such as taxi
   cabs which (unlike most data mules considered in past work) have no
   relation whatsoever with the smart city service providers, nor are
   required to follow any pre-established or optimized path, nor are
   willing to share their LTE connectivity. We experimentally evaluate data
   collection and delivery performance using real world traces gathered
   over a six month period in the city of Rome. Results suggest that even
   relatively small fleets, such as an average of about 120 vehicles,
   operating in parallel in a very large and irregular city such as Rome,
   can achieve an 80\% coverage of the downtown area in less than 24 h. (C)

Journal = {{AD HOC NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{71-81}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Estimation of time-dependent travel time in an urban network is a
   challenging task due to the interrupted nature of vehicular traffic
   flows. A novel concept of intersection-to intersection (I2I) real-time
   travel time estimation (TTE) and route suggestion model based on
   vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) technology is proposed for enabling the
   smart transportations in smart city. The system components,
   communication protocol and collaborative intelligence concept are
   designed to facilitate real-time vehicular applications. Vehicles
   equipped with an on-board unit (OBU) send TTE requests to the road side
   unit (RSU) and share their real-time information, including traveled
   path and average speed, and the RSU responds with the suggested shortest
   route as well as the estimated travel time. In order to efficiently
   share real-time traffic information among RSUs, a propagation-based
   RSU-to-RSU (R2R) data exchange algorithm and a traffic information
   super-matrix data structure are designed. These reduce the complexity
   from O(N-2) for a traditional broadcast approach to O(N). Real data
   collected from a GPS-based taxi dispatching system is applied to
   evaluate the accuracy of the proposed TTE model and the performance of
   the suggested route. The experimental results show that the average mean
   absolute error percentage (MAPE) of the proposed TTE model is 13.6\%
   compared to real taxi journeys, which indicates that the performances of
   the suggested routes are good. The TTE of the suggested paths has the
   possibility of being 82.2\% better than the paths traveled by taxi, and
   the travel time is thus reduced by 15.9\% on average over a year. (C)

Abstract = {{Quite a number of smart-city initiatives from around the world have been
   analyzed and documented, and a growing body of academic knowledge is
   evolving around the phenomenon of the smart city. Smart-city government
   is seen as an important driver for developing a smart urban environment.
   The eCityGov Alliance in the Pacific Northwest of the USA represents a
   special case of a successful smart-city collaboration between nine
   neighboring municipalities, which combined forces to provide smart
   services to citizens and businesses that no single municipality could
   have provided alone. Developing and maintaining a collaborative
   governance model appears as the most important key success factor in
   such multi-jurisdictional smart-city undertakings. This study
   investigates the governance model of the eCityGov Alliance and its
   opportunities, and potential pitfalls. It concludes that the eCityGov
   Alliance can serve as a role model for such multi-jurisdictional
   smart-city initiatives.}},

Title = {{A Machine-to-Machine protocol benchmark for eHealth applications - Use
   case: Respiratory rehabilitation}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communications represent one of the
   main pillars of the new paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT), and is
   making possible new opportunities for the eHealth business.
   Nevertheless, the large number of M2M protocols currently available
   hinders the election of a suitable solution that satisfies the
   requirements that can demand eHealth applications.
   Objectives: In the first place, to develop a tool that provides a
   benchmarking analysis in order to objectively select among the most
   relevant M2M protocols for eHealth solutions. In the second place, to
   validate the tool with a particular use case: the respiratory
   rehabilitation. Methods: A software tool, called Distributed Computing
   Framework (DFC), has been designed and developed to execute the
   benchmarking tests and facilitate the deployment in environments with a
   large number of machines, with independence of the protocol and
   performance metrics selected.
   Results: DDS, MQTT, CoAP, JMS, AMQP and XMPP protocols were evaluated
   considering different specific performance metrics, including CPU usage,
   memory usage, bandwidth consumption, latency and jitter. The results
   obtained allowed to validate a case of use: respiratory rehabilitation
   of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in two
   scenarios with different types of requirement: Home-Based and
   Ambulatory.
   Conclusions: The results of the benchmark comparison can guide eHealth
   developers in the choice of M2M technologies. In this regard, the
   framework presented is a simple and powerful tool for the deployment of
   benchmark tests under specific environments and conditions. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{As web technology and (big) data continue to transform how we organize
   ourselves, scholarly research increasingly zooms in on the
   socio-material conditions of citizen participation and public
   engagement, the objects and devices that organize publics. Where social
   issues may often be the driver of such public engagement, increasingly
   the city and, more specifically, the neighborhood itself have become a
   central objects connecting their inhabitants through online networks and
   neighborhood events. Tools and apps for citizen participation then weave
   together neighborhood stakeholders (e.g. inhabitants, municipal parties
   and entrepreneurs). This paper zooms in on a sample of 40 such tools
   that enable and organize bottom-up citizen participation in the city of
   Amsterdam. Combining a theoretical framework with content analysis,
   digital methods and data visualization, this paper marks the starting
   point of a longitudinal analysis of online tools for the urban bottom-up

Abstract = {{Urban underlying surface has been greatly changed with rapid
   urbanization, considered to be one of the major causes for the
   destruction of urban natural hydrological processes. This has imposed a
   huge challenge for stormwater management in cities. There has been a
   shift from gray water management to green stormwater management
   thinking. The green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) is regarded as an
   effective and cost-efficient stormwater management eco-landscape
   approach. China's GSI practice and the development of its theoretical
   framework are still in the initial stage. This paper presents an
   innovative framework for stormwater management, integrating green
   stormwater infrastructure and landscape security patterns on a regional
   scale based on an urban master plan. The core concept of green
   stormwater infrastructure eco-planning is to form an interconnected GSI
   network (i.e., stormwater management landscape security pattern) which
   consists of the location, portion, size, layout, and structure of GSI so
   as to efficiently safeguard natural hydrological processes. Shanghai
   Lingang New City, a satellite new town of Shanghai, China was selected
   as a case study for GSI studies. Simulation analyses of hydrological
   processes were carried out to identify the critical significant
   landscape nodes in the highpriority watersheds for stormwater
   management. GSI should be planned and implemented in these identified
   landscape nodes. The comprehensive stormwater management landscape
   security pattern of Shanghai Lingang New City is designed with
   consideration of flood control, stormwater control, runoff reduction,
   water quality protection, and rainwater utilization objectives which
   could provide guidelines for smart growth and sustainable development of
   this city.}},

Abstract = {{Energy sustainability and environmental preservation have become
   worldwide concerns with the many manifestations of climate change and
   the continually increasing demand for energy. As cities and nations
   become more technologically advanced, electricity consumption rises to
   levels that may no longer be manageable if left unattended. The Smart
   Grid offers an answer to the shift to more sustainable technologies such
   as distributed generation and microgrids. A general public awareness and
   adequate attention from potential researchers and policy makers is
   crucial. This paper presents an overview of the Smart Grid with its
   general features, functionalities and characteristics. It presents the
   Smart Grid fundamental and related technologies and have identified the
   research activities, challenges and issues. It demonstrates how these
   technologies have shaped the modern electricity grid and continued to
   evolve and strengthen its role in the better alignment of energy demand
   and supply. Smart Grid implementation and practices in various locations
   are also unveiled. Concrete energy policies facilitate Smart Grid
   initiatives across the nations. Interestingly, Smart Grid practices in
   different regions barely indicate competition but rather an unbordered
   community of similar aspirations and shared lessons. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Transport of energy over long distances from remote natural sources to
   consumers in big cities requires technical, economic and environmental
   considerations. Uncertain wind flow, sunshine, faults and communication
   failures can compromise system safety, reliability, power quality during
   small signal and large scale power system oscillations. HVAC systems
   tackle power swing issue by electrical islanding protection schemes
   which would need to be revised for integrated AC/DC systems. Advent of
   DC transformers, CSC-HVDC, VSC-HVDC and MMC-HVDC technologies have
   enabled the enhancement of power delivery and integration of renewable
   energy sources under smart grid vision. HVDC transmission lines are
   recognized as an efficient alternative to HVAC lines. HVAC system power
   transfer capability is limited by reactance, whereas HVDC lines can be
   loaded up to the conductor thermal limit. This paper reviews power
   transfer capabilities of HVAC, HVDC and High Phase Order (HPO) HVAC
   lines to compare their relative performance under diverse conditions.
   Techno-economic analysis of converting existing AC lines into DC lines
   is presented. High voltage race has been analyzed in context of
   environmental concerns and HVDC transmission systems are concluded to be
   the right path to energy transition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{When compared to large cities in developed countries, the shares of
   public transportation in most Chinese cities are low. Increasing the
   competitiveness of urban public transportation remains an urgent
   problem. A capable evaluation method for public transportation is
   required to assist the development of urban transit systems. This paper
   focuses on the bus system. Being devoid of standard criteria, it is
   difficult to determine the efficiency of a transit system or any bus
   line using a single evaluation index. This paper proposes a comparative
   analysis to evaluate bus lines so as to filter out candidates for
   further optimization. From the viewpoints of transit planning, operation
   and quality of service, this paper establishes 10 subordinate evaluation
   indices and then uses geographical information system tools, global
   positioning system data and smart card data to assist the index
   definition and calculation. Super-efficient data envelopment analysis
   (DEA) method is adopted for the proposed single factor and comprehensive
   evaluation models. Finally, the bus system in Shenzhen, China is used as
   a case study. The comparable significant results validate the capability
   of the proposed model.}},

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Growing dissatisfaction with the prevailing dispersed urban form and its
   generalized reliance on the automobile has resulted in the formulation
   of planning models seeking to substitute dispersed development with
   recentralization. A survey of 301 planning documents with a metropolitan
   focus, originating from the 58 US and Canadian urban regions with a
   population exceeding one million, reveals widespread support for urban
   recentralization. But interviews with 55 planners, involved in the
   preparation of these plans and/or the implementation of their proposals,
   highlight actual and foreseen barriers to the implementation of
   recentralization strategies. The article interprets the popularity of
   recentralization in planning documents as the outcome of planners'
   attempts to reconcile their commitment to sustainable development with
   societal factors affecting planning possibilities. Still, we anticipate
   serious problems in achieving largescale recentralization due to urban
   development path dependencies emanating from the prevailing urban form
   and dynamics, institutional structures, and from the limited urban
   transformative potential afforded by neoliberalism.}},

Title = {{Sustainable Wearables: Wearable Technology for Enhancing the Quality of
   Human Life}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to elicit insights about sustainable wearables by
   investigating recent advancements in wearable technology and their
   applications. Wearable technology has advanced considerably from a
   technical perspective, but it has stagnated due to barriers without
   penetrating wider society despite early positive expectations. This
   situation is the motivation behind the focus on studies by many research
   groups in recent years into wearable applications that can provide the
   best value from a human-oriented perspective. The expectation is that a
   new means to resolve the issue can be found from a viewpoint of
   sustainability; this is the main point of this paper. This paper first
   focuses on the trend of wearable technology like bodily status
   monitoring, multi-wearable device control, and smart networking between
   wearable sensors. Second, the development intention of such technology
   is investigated. Finally, this paper discusses about the applications of
   current wearable technology from the sustainable perspective, rather
   than detailed description of the component technologies employed in
   wearables. In this paper, the definition of sustainable wearables is
   discussed in the context of improving the quality of individual life,
   social impact, and social public interest; those wearable applications
   include the areas of wellness, healthcare, assistance for the visually
   impaired, disaster relief, and public safety. In the future, wearables
   will not be simple data trackers or fun accessories but will gain
   extended objectives and meanings that play a valuable role for
   individuals and societies. Successful and sustainable wearables will
   lead to positive changes for both individuals and societies overall.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm based on the Internet that
   comprises many interconnected technologies like RFID (Radio Frequency
   IDentification) and WSAN (Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks) in order

   this field, have originated the appearance and creation of multiple
   systems like smart-home, smart-city and smart-grid. However, the
   limitations of associated devices in the IoT in terms of storage,
   network and computing, and the requirements of complex analysis,
   scalability, and data access, require a technology like Cloud Computing
   to supplement this field. Moreover, the IoT can generate large amounts
   of varied data and quickly when there are millions of things feeding
   data to Cloud Computing. The latter is a clear example of Big Data, that
   Cloud Computing needs to take into account. This paper presents a survey
   of integration components: Cloud platforms, Cloud infrastructures and
   IoT Middleware. In addition, some integration proposals and data

Abstract = {{Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication is a promising technology for
   next generation communication systems. This communication paradigm
   facilitates ubiquitous communications with full mechanical automation,
   where a large number of intelligent devices connected by wired/wireless
   links, interact with each other without direct human intervention. As a
   result, M2M communication finds applications in wide areas such as smart
   grids, e-healthcare, home area networks, intelligent transportation
   systems, environmental monitoring, smart cities, and industrial
   automation. However, distinctive features in M2M communications form
   different challenges from those in human-to-human communications. These
   challenges need to be addressed, or otherwise it is not easy for this
   paradigm to gain trust of people. To understand M2M communications
   deeply, this paper presents a comprehensive review of M2M communication
   technology in terms of its system model architecture proposed by
   different standards developing organizations. This mainly includes 3GPP,
   ETSI, and oneM2M. Further, we have investigated distinctive features of
   various M2M applications and their supporting attributes, the M2M data
   traffic and their characterization, various M2M standardization bodies
   and their unique tasks, and potential M2M communication challenges and
   their proposed state-of-the-art solutions, followed by future research

Abstract = {{The New Urbanism (NU) planning movement aspires to create socially
   diverse neighborhoods. It is unclear, however, whether this movement
   lives up to its aspirations in practice. In an effort to systematically
   examine this aspect of the movement, this paper analyzes age, family
   type, income, and race data of 70 NU neighborhoods in the United States.
   The paper uses a diversity index to compare the NU neighborhoods with
   control sites. Findings show that NU neighborhoods have lower racial
   diversity, but may have higher income diversity. Consideration of
   variations within the way NU is implemented reveals that the low racial
   diversity is associated with a single approach, but higher income
   diversity is associated with all variants. This paper argues that NU
   generates places that are more socially diverse than what is described
   in the literature and uses two case studies to explore the ways in which
   diversity is produced and its relation to gentrification.}},

Abstract = {{We present a computational method that exploits points of interest
   (POIs) to generate realistic virtual pedestrians for a city model, i.e.,
   a simulated crowd. Our method is validated using mobility traces
   collected longitudinally from a city-wide free and open Wi-Fi network in
   downtown Oulu, Finland. Analysing this data, we first construct a
   time-varying Origin-Destination matrix that describes how individual
   pedestrians in our city move at different times and places. We compare
   this ground-truth against a random pedestrian model to investigate how
   the latter underestimates or overestimates movement at various locations
   or times of day. By identifying these deviations, we can calibrate a
   weighted model that uses POIs from OpenStreetMap to adjust the simulated
   crowd. Our results show a significant accuracy improvement over the
   random model, while at the same time our work is readily applicable to
   simulating crowds in other cities (real and virtual) as long as POI can
   be defined spatially. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Technology of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is becoming mature, and many AVs
   will appear on roads in the near future. AVs become connected with the
   support of various vehicular communication technologies, and they
   possess a high degree of control to respond to instantaneous situations
   cooperatively with high efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, we
   propose a new public transportation system based on AVs. It manages a
   fleet of AVs to accommodate transportation requests, offering
   point-to-point services with ride sharing. We focus on the two major
   problems of the system: scheduling and admission control. The former is
   to configure the most economical schedules and routes for the AVs to
   satisfy the admissible requests, whereas the latter is to determine the
   set of admissible requests among all requests to produce maximum profit.
   The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program,
   and the admission control problem is cast as a bilevel optimization,
   which embeds the scheduling problem as the major constraint. By
   utilizing the analytical properties of the problem, we develop an
   effective genetic-algorithm-based method to tackle the admission control
   problem. We validate the performance of the algorithm with real-world
   transportation service data.}},

Abstract = {{Constructing intelligent and efficient transportation systems for modern
   metropolitan areas has become a very important quest for nations
   possessing metropolitan cities with ever-increasing populations. A new
   trend is the development of smart vehicles with multiple sensors able to
   dynamically form a temporary vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) or a
   vehicular sensor network (VSN). Along with a wireless-enabled roadside
   unit (RSU) network, drivers in a VSN can efficiently exchange important
   or urgent traffic information and make driving decisions accordingly. In
   order to support secure communication and driver privacy for vehicles in
   a VSN, we develop a new identity-based (ID-based) signature based on the
   elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC) and then adopt it to propose a novel
   conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme based on our
   invented ID-based signature. This scheme provides secure authentication
   process for messages transmitted between vehicles and RSUs. A batch
   message verification mechanism is also supported by the proposed scheme
   to increase the message processing throughput of RSUs. To further
   enhance scheme efficiency, both pairing operation and MapToPoint
   operation are not applied in the proposed authentication scheme. In
   comparison with existing pseudo-ID-based authentication solutions for
   VSN, this paper shows that the proposed scheme has better performance in
   terms of time consumption.}},

Abstract = {{How do technology users effectively transit from having zero knowledge
   about a technology to making the best use of it after an authoritative
   technology adoption? This post-adoption user learning has received
   little research attention in technology management literature. In this
   paper we investigate user learning in authoritative technology adoption
   by developing an agent-based model using the case of council-led smart
   meter deployment in the UK City of Leeds. Energy consumers gain
   experience of using smart meters based on the learning curve in
   behavioural learning. With the agent-based model we carry out
   experiments to validate the model and test different energy
   interventions that local authorities can use to facilitate energy
   consumers' learning and maintain their continuous use of the technology.
   Our results show that the easier energy consumers become experienced,
   the more energy-efficient they are and the more energy saving they can
   achieve; encouraging energy consumers' contacts via various
   informational means can facilitate their learning; and developing and
   maintaining their positive attitude toward smart metering can enable
   them to use the technology continuously. Contributions and energy
   policy/intervention implications are discussed in this paper. (C) 2016

Journal = {{TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{32-39}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A special and holistic approach is needed that captures aggregate
   attributes and emergent behaviors of the complex system of
   infrastructure systems in a region. Effective management of the impacts
   of future population growth, urbanization, and risks arising from
   continued evolution of our natural, physical and human/societal systems
   will require a systematic exploration and characterization of the urban
   subsurface, including much improved understanding and assessment of
   geologic risks. With recent cost escalations for underground
   construction projects, incentives are needed for the underground
   construction industry to develop and implement innovations in methods
   and technology, and smart integrated planning is needed to reduce costs
   both during construction and with life-cycle engineered design and
   operation of our subsurface facilities.
   The needed framework requires investigation of potential metrics that
   reflect the performance of aggregate functions of an urban environment
   so that we can holistically study system performance response under
   ``normal{''} and ``stressed{''} operation. Such a metric can support a
   cross-disciplinary exploration of urban resilience, and build knowledge
   as we develop and test theory and models that explore resilience of
   complex socio-technical systems. Econometrics with spatial and temporal
   granularity will help to understand the integrated functionality of our
   cities and to establish appropriate policies that will drive continuous
   improvement in the quality of urban life while providing natural, human,
   and physical urban environmental resilience. The underground in urban
   regions can become an important component of managing the increasing
   complexity of our physical systems, and can also make more significant
   contributions to improving the robustness and resilience of our future
   cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Use of Urban Underground Space (UUS) has been growing significantly in
   the world's biggest and wealthiest cities. UUS has been long
   acknowledged to be important to the urban development agenda:
   sustainability, resilience, livability, and creating a better urban
   environment in particular. These issues are traditionally monitored
   using urban indicators, however UUS has not been properly included and
   considered in urban indicator lists (sets or systems) yet - the gap this
   paper is aiming to bridge. The paper reviews existing approaches to the
   composition of urban indicator lists, highlighting indicator types,
   challenges related to data collection, and agencies that are concerned
   with the issue. Further the paper has identified the importance of UUS
   inclusion in the lists that give integrated assessment and monitor urban
   sustainability, resilience, climate change adaptation and mitigation, as
   well as progress towards smart, livable, and compact cities. Existing
   global quantitative data on UUS have been examined in 8 cities; and
   three key indicators (descriptors) were suggested to monitor UUS use:
   Developed UUS volume (m(3)); UUS use density (m(3)/m(2)); and Developed
   UUS volume per person (m(3)/person). Current average UUS use densities
   in cities are identified as up to about 0.05 (m(3)/m(2)) (which can be
   interpreted as a virtual depth of UUS use of 5 cm), and the developed
   UUS volume per person is up to about 10 m(3)/person; while city central
   areas (central business districts) can have a virtual depth of developed
   UUS of several metres (m(3)/m(2)). Compatibility, comparability,
   uniformity, and sustained monitoring of urban indicators data (including
   UUS indicators) found to be posing significant challenges to the
   research across geographies, and industry/economic sectors. (C) 2015 The

Journal = {{TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{96-102}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Driven by urbanization growth, in recent years, the relationships among
   energy systems and underground space are becoming more and more intense
   for many reasons: the severe competition in the land use, the security
   of energy commodities management, the need of huge infrastructures for
   mass and energy transportation (e.g. pipelines), the safety requirements
   against seismic events and eventually, economic and environmental
   considerations.
   For such reasons, nowadays underground space is becoming an extremely
   important as an alternative for urban areas expansion, if properly
   planned. In fact, a correct underground space planning strategy,
   together with the progressive developments of suitable integrated
   connections between surface and subsurface can increase the livability
   of cities and improve public health.
   Population in urban areas is expected to grow, in particular in
   developing economies (such as China); this phenomenon leads to an
   increasing pressure on urban areas to supply the growing energy needs.
   In fact, several end-use services should be fulfilled to provide indoor
   comfort in buildings, for mobility of people and goods, etc. Anyway,
   only a very limited amount of energy can be generated inside urban areas
   (from municipal solid wastes, from thermal/solar PV and heat pumps
   installations); as a consequence, the majority of the energy commodities
   are produced, converted and stored in power plants located far from
   cities and require huge transport infrastructures.
   In this paper, the cost/benefit relationship between underground and
   energy use is explained by reviewing main application of existing
   underground space utilizations for energy processes (distribution,
   storage and generation), as well as other innovative opportunities. From
   the analysis of past experiences analysis, the main conclusion is that a
   rational approach in urban energy planning procedures, integrating both
   over- and below-ground space utilizations, could help to raise the
   quality of energy services and it is fundamental for reaching a smarter
   and more resilient society. In such a new Underground Urbanism approach,
   the need for long-term Integrated Master Plans that propose suitable
   Guidelines is highlighted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The urbanization process leads many urban areas and megacities to be
   densely built and to overcome their physical and operational limits; in
   several cases, urban population density is growing faster than their
   infrastructures. Considering land use constraints, for mitigating some
   disagreeable living conditions and for creating new population
   opportunities, city planners have different opportunities involving the
   two opposite vertical directions: upward, erecting higher buildings or
   downward, developing a more intense use of the underground space. Both
   directions are characterized by positive and negative aspects and
   require suitable local condition to be built.
   In this paper, main issues related to the urban underground planning
   procedures are highlighted, taking also in consideration that after some
   very old visionary approaches, no relevant debates and concrete results
   have been further developed. Several underground-related technicalities
   are described and analyzed, mainly at sectorial level (f.i. mass
   transport systems, infrastructures for energy and water supply, storage
   facilities) however, experiences of a global urban planning - involving
   a holistic approach inside a City Master Plan - are still very few
   (Helsinki). A collection of some best practices is reviewed in this
   paper. Particular emphasis is devoted to the integrated planning
   approach and the related tools for the subsurface space assessment: the
   role of different planning tools for the rational use of the underground
   space in urban areas is analyzed and a variety of planning levels are
   discussed, from the more general one - the Master Plan - to the more
   sectorial ones. Moreover, the more recent visions for future cities -
   Smart, Resilient, Low-carbon and Post-Carbon Cities - are producing
   relevant and very useful technical and management solutions and the role
   of Integrated Mater Plans in this transition is further discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the World Wide Web is growing at increasing rate and speed,
   and consequently the online available resources populating Internet
   represent a large source of knowledge for various business and research
   interests. For instance, over the past years, increasing attention has
   been focused on retrieving information related to geographical location
   of places and entities, which is largely contained in web pages and
   documents. However, such resources are represented in a wide variety of
   generally unstructured formats, and this actually does not help final
   users to find desired information items. The automatic annotation and
   comprehension of toponyms, location names and addresses (at different
   resolution and granularity levels) can deliver significant benefits for
   the whole web community by improving search engines filtering
   capabilities and intelligent data mining systems. The present paper
   addresses the problem of gathering geographical information from
   unstructured text in web pages and documents. In the specific, the
   proposed method aims at extracting geographical location (at street
   number resolution) of commercial companies and services, by annotating
   geo-related information from their web domains. The annotation process
   is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text
   comprehension, and relies on Pattern Matching and Hierarchical Cluster
   Analysis for recognizing and dis-ambiguating geographical entities.
   Geotagging performances have been assessed by evaluating Precision,
   Recall and F-Measure of the proposed system output (represented in form
   of semantic RDF triples) against both a geo-annotated reference database
   and a semantic Smart City repository. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To improve the efficiency of big data feature learning, the paper
   proposes a privacy preserving deep computation model by offloading the
   expensive operations to the cloud. Privacy concerns become evident
   because there are a large number of private data by various applications
   in the smart city, such as sensitive data of governments or proprietary
   information of enterprises. To protect the private data, the proposed
   model uses the BGV encryption scheme to encrypt the private data and
   employs cloud servers to perform the high-order back-propagation
   algorithm on the encrypted data efficiently for deep computation model
   training. Furthermore, the proposed scheme approximates the Sigmoid
   function as a polynomial function to support the secure computation of
   the activation function with the BGV encryption. In our scheme, only the
   encryption operations and the decryption operations are performed by the
   client while all the computation tasks are performed on the cloud.
   Experimental results show that our scheme is improved by approximately
   2.5 times in the training efficiency compared to the conventional deep
   computation model without disclosing the private data using the cloud
   computing including ten nodes. More importantly, our scheme is highly
   scalable by employing more cloud servers, which is particularly suitable
   for big data.}},

   and collaborative approach for detecting damage in structures, our
   algorithm makes use of cooperative information fusion for calculating a
   damage coefficient. We conducted experiments for evaluating the
   algorithm in terms of its accuracy and efficient use of the constrained
   WSAN resources. We found that our collaborative and information
   fusion-based approach ensures the accuracy of our algorithm and that it
   can answer promptly to stimuli (1.091s), triggering actuators. Moreover,
   for 100 nodes or less in the WSAN, the communication overhead of our
   algorithm is tolerable and the WSAN running our algorithm, operating
   system and protocols can last as long as 468 days.}},

Abstract = {{We are witnessing increasing interests in developing ``smart cities{''}
   which helps improve the efficiency, reliability, and security of a
   traditional city. An important aspect of developing smart cities is to
   enable ``smart transportation,{''} which improves the efficiency,
   safety, and environmental sustainability of city transportation means.
   Meanwhile, the increasing use of GPS devices has led to the emergence of
   big trajectory data that consists of large amounts of historical
   trajectories and real-time GPS data streams that reflect how the
   transportation networks are used or being used by moving objects, e.g.,
   vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. Such big trajectory data provides a
   solid data foundation for developing various smart transportation
   applications, such as congestion avoidance, reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions, and effective traffic accident response, etc. Instead of
   proposing yet another specific smart transportation application, we
   propose the parallel-distributed network-constrained moving objects
   database (PD-NMOD), a general framework that manages big trajectory data
   in a scalable manner, which provides an infrastructure that is able to
   support a wide variety of smart transportation applications and thus
   benefiting the smart city vision as a whole. The PD-NMOD manages both
   transportation networks and trajectories in a distributed manner. In
   addition, the PD-NMOD is designed to support general SQL queries over
   moving objects and to efficiently process the SQL queries on big
   trajectory data in parallel. Such design facilitates smart
   transportation applications to retrieve relevant trajectory data and to
   conduct statistical analyses. Empirical studies on a large trajectory
   data set collected from 3,500 taxis in Beijing offer insight into the
   design properties of the PD-NMOD and offer evidence that the PD-NMOD is
   efficient and scalable.}},

Abstract = {{Buildings account for nearly 40 percent of the total energy consumption
   in the United States. As a critical step toward smart cities, it is
   essential to intelligently manage and coordinate the building operations
   to improve the efficiency and reliability of overall energy system. With
   the advent of smart meters and two-way communication systems, various
   energy consumptions from smart buildings can now be coordinated across
   the smart grid together with other energy loads and power plants. In
   this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to integrate the
   operations of smart buildings into the energy scheduling of bulk power
   system through proactive building demand participation. This new scheme
   enables buildings to proactively express and communicate their energy
   consumption preferences to smart grid operators rather than passively
   receive and react to market signals and instructions such as time
   varying electricity prices. The proposed scheme is implemented in a
   simulation environment. The experiment results show that the proactive
   demand response scheme can achieve up to 10 percent system generation
   cost reduction and 20 percent building operation cost reduction compared
   with passive demand response scheme. The results also demonstrate that
   the system cost savings increase significantly with more flexible load
   installed and higher percentage of proactive customers participation
   level in the power network.}},

Title = {{Operational and Tactical Management of Water and Energy Resources in

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Optimal management of water and energy resources worldwide is a basis
   for environmental and socioeconomic sustainability in urban areas, which
   has become even more relevant with the advent of the smart and water
   sensitive city paradigm. In water distribution networks (WDNs) water
   resource management is concerned with increased efficiency, which is
   primarily related to the reduction of leakages, whereas energy
   management refers to optimal pump, valve, and source scheduling
   strategies considering the hydraulic system requirements. These
   management goals require planning of asset renewal and improvement works
   in the short time (operational) and medium time (tactical) horizons,
   considering the financial sustainability of relevant actions. The battle
   of background leakage assessment for water networks (BBLAWN) was
   designed as a competition held at the 16th Water Distribution Systems
   Analysis Conference, in Bari (Italy) in 2014 (WDSA), to address the
   aforementioned management goals. The teams taking part in the BBLAWN
   were asked to develop a methodology for both reducing real water losses
   and saving energy in a real WDN considering the possibility of asset
   renewal and strengthening. Fourteen teams from academia, research
   centers, and industry presented their solutions at a special session of
   the WDSA 2014 conference. This paper briefly describes the BBLAWN and
   presents one of the solutions provided by the organizers to illustrate
   the ideas and challenges embedded in the posed problem. The overview of
   the solutions provided by the participants shows that management
   decisions need to be supported by engineering judgment and with tools
   that combine computationally effective multiobjective optimization and
   hydraulic models capable of assessing pressure-dependent background
   leakages. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Public lighting represents a large part of the energy consumption of
   towns and cities. Efficient management of public lighting can entail
   significant energy savings. This work presents a smart system for
   managing public lighting networks based on wireless communication and
   the DALI protocol. Wireless communication entails significant economic
   savings, as there is no need to install new wiring and visual impacts
   and damage to the facades of historical buildings in city centers are
   avoided. The DALI protocol uses bidirectional communication with the
   ballast, which allows its status to be controlled and monitored at all
   times. The novelty of this work is that it tackles all aspects related
   to the management of public lighting: a standard protocol, DALI, was
   selected to control the ballast, a wireless node based on the IEEE
   802.15.4 standard with a DALI interface was designed, a network layer
   that considers the topology of the lighting network has been developed,
   and lastly, some user-friendly applications for the control and
   maintenance of the system by the technical crews of the different towns
   and cities have been developed.}},

Abstract = {{The efficient use of resources is a matter of great concern in today's
   society, especially in the energy sector. Although the main strategy to
   decrease energy use has long been focused on supply, over the last few
   years, there has been a shift to the demand side. Under this new line of
   action, demand-side management networks have emerged and extended from
   the household level to larger installations, with the appearance of the
   concepts of Smart Grids and even Smart Cities. The extended use of Smart
   Meters for measuring residential electricity consumption facilitates the
   creation of such intelligent environments. In this context, this article
   proposes a system which extracts value from the collected consumer
   information to identify the appliances belonging to that smart
   environment by means of machine learning techniques. Considering the
   large amount of information that would be handled when millions of homes
   were sending data, big data technology has been used. An experiment to
   evaluate the classification method was carried out with seven devices
   and three different configurations. The results are also reported,
   achieving promising results, with recognition rates of 75 \% after 1 h
   of training and 100 \% after 4 h.}},

   ensure the correctness of collected data. If the collected data is
   tampered, the results of data analysis is unbelievable, and may even
   bring serious disaster. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous ring
   signcryption scheme for secure communication from sensors to servers. We
   prove that this scheme has the indistinguishability against adaptive
   chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2) and existential unforgeability
   against adaptive chosen messages attacks under the computational
   Diffie-Hellman problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme has the
   following advantages (1) it simultaneously achieves confidentiality,
   integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and anonymity in a logical
   single step; (2) it is heterogeneous and allows a sensor node in an
   identity-based cryptography to send a message to a server in a public
   key infrastructure. These features make our scheme suitable for data
   transmission in the IoT.}},

Abstract = {{The current study applied cloud computing technology and smart mobile
   devices combined with a streaming server for parking lots to plan a city
   parking integration system. It is also equipped with a parking search

   near their destination, using various parking servers and the system
   center to connect to and integrate the cloud server. The computing power
   of the cloud servers transmits five of the closest parking lots with
   available parking spaces to a user's smart mobile device so the user can
   choose the most suitable parking lot. After users arrive at the parking
   lot, they can scan the information in the parking lot using an RFID
   indoor positioning system and the users' current location, so that the
   location of vacant parking spaces in the parking lot and moving vehicles
   will be displayed on their smart mobile device. In addition, the stored

Abstract = {{Street lighting systems have contributed to undesirable local government
   expenditure, electricity peak loads, and greenhouse gas emissions.
   However, inadequate information on the benefits from energy efficiency
   improvements has given street lighting systems a lower priority in
   national energy efficiency policy. This paper estimates the national
   benefits arising from energy efficiency improvements on street lighting
   systems based on a pilot project in Jakarta city and energy audits in
   other three cities. The energy efficiency actions considered in the
   audits are the installation of power meters on every panel in street
   lighting systems and the replacement of old, inefficient armatures with
   high-efficiency armatures that are integrated with the dimming schemes
   featured in smart street lighting technology. The results show that
   electricity consumption reduction potential from energy efficiency
   improvements can reach 2.1 Terra Watts hours annually. This is
   equivalent to energy costs of USD 177.4 million, a USD 46.8 million
   energy subsidy saving, and a 2.4 million ton CO2e, emission reduction.
   These findings can provide policymakers with important inputs while
   undertaking a social cost-benefit analysis of energy efficiency
   improvements in street lighting systems. However, achieving the
   potential benefits requires an active participation from investors or
   the Energy Service Company (ESCO) since local governments generally have
   limited budgets to implement these actions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The growth of Decentralized Energy Systems (DES) signals a new frontier
   in urban energy planning and design of local energy systems. As
   affordability of renewable energy technologies (RET) increases, cities
   and urban regions become the venues, not only for energy consumption but
   also for generation and distribution, which calls for systemic and
   paradigmatic change in local energy infrastructure. The decentralizing
   transitions of urban energy systems, particularly solar photovoltaic and
   thermal technologies, require a comprehensive assessment of their
   sociotechnical co-evolution- how technologies and social responses
   evolve together and how their co-evolution affects urban planning and
   energy policies. So far, urban planning literature has mainly focused on
   the impact of physical urban forms on efficiency of energy consumption,
   overlooking how the dynamics of new energy technologies and associated
   social responses affect local systems of energy infrastructure, the
   built environments and their residents. This paper provides an
   interdisciplinary review on the co-evolving technical and social
   dynamics of DES focusing on Distributed Generation (DG), MicroGrids
   (MG), and Smart MicroGrids (SMG), in order to draw insights for their
   integration in urban planning and policy, in particular reference to
   climate change mitigation and adaptation planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Could Key Engine, as a new open-source for RES technology development,
   start the third industrial revolution?}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{1194-1209}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Given that the first industrial revolution was based on Steam Engine
   (coal as energy source), and the second on oil and electricity, where
   both these revolutions are actually ``high carbon{''} revolutions, it is
   logical to expect that the third industrial revolution should be based
   on systems of renewable energy sources (RES), in order to minimize the
   problems arising from climate changes and to achieve sustainable
   development.
   However, the usage of the RES technologies and daily/weekly storage of
   energy and their connection to smart grids is not enough for the
   expected third industrial revolution. The start of this revolution would
   require technologies that have a great potential for further development
   and ability to supply, at any time, the necessary energy and power to a
   settlement/city, as well as drinking water, meeting the peak load
   requirements, continuously throughout the year, and independently of
   external sources of energy and drinking water. This would be provided
   from intermittent RES energy (solar, wind, etc.) and sea or other
   unclean source of water as natural resources.
   In that context, this paper presents a radically new technological
   solution: Key Engine which uses only natural resources: the sun, sea and
   gravity, in order to continuously and simultaneously supply a consumer
   with energy, power and drinking water. This solution has all the
   essential features required to start a third industrial revolution.
   The basic unit of Key Engine consists of the solar thermal (ST)
   generator with parabolic trough collectors through which sea water flows
   directly, absorbing thermal energy of solar radiation. After the
   separation of steam from seawater, the steam drives turbines and
   generators and produces electricity that is delivered to Pump Storage
   Hydroelectric (PSH) facility with seawater, which balances the daily and
   seasonal surpluses and shortages of energy, thus ensuring a continuous
   supply of electric power and energy to a consumer. At the same time, the
   water that comes out of the turbine, passes through the water treatment
   unit and is stored in drinking water reservoir, enabling continuous
   supply of the same consumer with drinking water.
   The paper presents theoretical aspects of Key Engine, model for optimal
   sizing and practical formulas for the calculation of characteristic
   values of the system, which could be the basis for further scientific
   research, development and innovative solutions that would help engineers
   in practice for numerous and diverse applications of Key Engine.
   In order to verify the derived mathematical relationships and models for
   optimizing the Key Engine in real conditions, the case study of the
   island of Vis in the Adriatic Sea, Croatia, has been considered, along
   with total annual irradiance of 1575 kW h/m(2) a, total annual electric
   energy consumption of 20 GW h and drinking water consumption of 453,382
   m(3). The obtained results: power of ST generator of 52 MW, working
   volume of the upper reservoir of 7 hm(3), total annual electric energy
   production of 62 GW h/a, and drinking water production of 480,754
   m(3)/a, clearly show that the new technology can fully meet the needs of
   the considered consumer for energy and drinking water.
   As the basic idea of Key Engine relies on the use of natural resources,
   i.e. RES energy and sea, the paper presents only the starting solution,
   whereby, apart from the sun, RES can be wind, or other renewable
   sources, that can perform separation of vapor from seawater and thus
   produce drinking water, as well as energy simultanously. Also, energy
   storage may not be performed solely by the PSH technology, but also by
   any other technology that can provide seasonal balancing of energy. All
   this suggests that the Key Engine can be understood as an open-source
   for RES technology development and thus bring changes in all three
   aspects of sustainable development: economy, society and environment.

Abstract = {{Running out of fossil fuels and rising of environmental issues
   pressurize energy policies in the direction of increasing renewable
   energy utilization. As a part of full-recycling scheme, Municipal Solid
   Waste (MSW) can be accounted as an alternative and prevalent source of
   renewable energy for smart grid applications. This study presents a case
   study investigating the future of dry combustion in Turkey and gives
   some projections on Energy from Waste (EfW) utilization potentials as
   secondary local generators. EfW potential of MSW incineration plants is
   modeled depending on MSW mass function. An empirical formula for
   prediction of EfW potential of Turkey is derived by curve fitting to
   yearly MSW data. Dependence of EfW potential on human population is
   modeled and thus spread of EfW potential over the territory of Anatolia
   landscape is illustrated. Analyses reveal that EfW has a potential to be
   local source of renewable energy for future smart grids due to the fact
   that EfW exhibits energy generation distribution correlated with city
   population. We concluded that EfW incineration plants can act on
   sustainable development of Turkey by serving as a consistent,
   distributed, near-field generators integrated to waste management

Abstract = {{Nowadays cities tend to become ``Smarter{''}, usually disregarding the
   issues of energy efficiency and sustainability. Therefore, optimizing
   energy use in a city remains a challenge and respective decision support
   systems are important to guide local authorities toward that direction.
   This paper provides a holistic approach presenting a Smart City Energy
   Assessment Framework (SCEAF) along with a specific web based decision
   support tool, the so-called e-SCEAF, which can provide local authorities
   with fruitful results for assessing the energy behavior and performance
   of their city. The tool merges heterogeneous information, such as
   clearly quantifiable energy related indicators, the related city policy
   context performance and the integration of smart infrastructure. This
   multi-source information fusion is based on the 2-tuple linguistic
   representation model of Herrera and Martinez. This particular model has
   been widely used in decision problems and was mainly selected due to the
   fact that it provides linguistic results that are accurate and easy to
   understand by the cities' local authorities. The performance, usefulness
   and effectiveness of the SCEAF framework and the e-SCEAF tool are tested
   on a real life application in three different cities, Savona (Italy),
   Sant Cugat del Valles (Spain) and Zaanstad (The Netherlands). In this
   respect, the role of fusion methods and algorithms for merging multiple
   information will be evaluated in a ``real life environment{''}. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Problem, research strategy, and findings: Historic preservation and
   planning often operate together in the United States within local
   planning departments, sharing some common roots and a ``fragile, uneasy
   alliance{''} (Birch \& Roby, 1984). Over time, developments in both
   preservation and planning brought these disciplines and professions
   closer together, including shared concern for sustainability and common
   ground in community economic development, revitalization, land use
   planning, and urban design. Simultaneously, areas of tension and
   potential conflict emerged. Some preservation-oriented scholars and
   practitioners call for the expansion of preservation's sphere of
   influence and concern, while others caution of negative effects. In this
   literature review, I identify areas of confluence and friction, as well
   as silences and gaps, focusing especially on planning and preservation
   literature since the 1980s.Takeaway for practice: Few scholars have
   identified what planners and preservationists (and those who do both)
   can learn from one another, with some important exceptions. Planning
   scholarship can benefit from understanding how preservation has changed
   in tandem and in relation to planning. Preservationists can gain much
   from incorporating contemporary planning theory, especially with regard
   to participation and building an equity agenda for preservation that
   builds from preservation's strengths and recent advances toward
   recognizing a wider, more representative set of historic resources. Both
   planners and preservationists can benefit from stronger alliances in
   which scholars and practitioners engage in deeper dialogues and
   exchange. This interdisciplinary collaboration can unite leadership and
   vision with regard to equity and social justice, with deeper place-based
   knowledge to improve the social, environmental, and economic health of
   communities.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Internet of Things (iIoT) devices are usually considered external
   application dependencies that only provide data or process and execute
   simple instructions. The recent emergence of IoT devices with embedded
   execution environments allows practitioners to deploy and execute custom
   application logic directly on the device. This approach fundamentally
   changes the overall process of designing, developing, deploying, and
   managing IoT systems. However, these devices exhibit significant
   differences in available execution environments, processing, and storage
   capabilities. To accommodate this diversity, a structured approach is
   needed to uniformly and transparently deploy application components onto
   a large number of heterogeneous devices. This is especially important in
   the context of large-scale IoT systems, such as in the smart city
   domain. In this article, we present LEONORE, an infrastructure toolset
   that provides elastic provisioning of application components on
   resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge devices in large-scale IoT
   deployments. LEONORE supports push-based as well as pull-based
   deployments. To improve scalability and reduce generated network traffic
   between cloud and edge infrastructure, we present a distributed
   provisioning approach that deploys LEONORE local nodes within the
   deployment infrastructure close to the actual edge devices. We show that
   our solution is able to elastically provision large numbers of devices
   using a testbed based on a real-world industry scenario.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a mobile application with intelligent
   systems to provide services for cyclists and enhance their cycling
   experiences in smart cities. The application utilizes smartphones and
   low-power ZigBee technology for ad-hoc networking. Since ZigBee chipsets
   have not been included yet in recent smartphones, we develop a
   Smartphone-ZigBee embedded system that we use in building a mobile
   application for low-power low-bandwidth wireless ad-hoc networking with
   acceptable ranges. Cyclists can join either public networks or create
   their own private networks to exchange information and utilize several
   developed services. For voice communication between cyclists, we develop
   a multilingual voice communication system with an innovative smart
   spectrum and energy management approach. A sender cyclist can speak in
   his own language while being translated and heard in a clear voice by
   the receiver cyclist in another language with an acceptable delay less
   than 1 s. We also develop an intelligent geo-localization system that
   utilizes smartphone's GPS receiver to provide real-time geo-locations
   and speeds of all cyclists connected to the same network on a visual
   interactive map. The latter system adaptively manages the number of
   visits to the GPS receiver according to various system parameters to
   reduce power consumption. Moreover, we develop an emergency system that
   provides a platform for efficient collaboration between cyclists in
   emergency conditions. To ensure safety of cyclists, all our services are
   accessed vocally. Furthermore, we provide an energy harvesting system
   using the movement of the bike for power generation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate an application of a triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG) as a self-powered communication unit. An
   elaborately designed TENG is used to translate a series of environmental
   triggering signals into binary digital signals and drives an electronic
   optical device to transmit binary digital data in real-time without an
   external power supply. The elaborately designed TENG is built in a
   membrane structure that can effectively drive the electronic optical
   device in a bandwidth from 1.30 to 1.65 kHz. Two typical communication
   modes (amplitude-shift keying and frequency-shift keying) are realized
   through the resonant response of TENG to different frequencies, and two
   digital signals, i.e., ``1001{''} and ``0110{''}, are successfully
   transmitted and received through this system, respectively. Hence, in
   this study, a simple but efficient method for directly transmitting
   ambient vibration to the receiver as a digital signal is established
   using an elaborately designed TENG and an optical communication
   technique. This type of the communication system, as well as the
   implementation method presented, exhibits great potential for
   applications in the smart city, smart home, password authentication, and
   so on.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The reports presented by consulting firms show that annual energy costs
   generated by 340 million streetlights are expected to reach \$23.9 to
   \$42.5 billion by 2025. Those numbers reveal a motivation behind the
   research aiming at optimizing outdoor lighting energy efficiency. They
   show that even a small unit improvement can yield large benefits due to
   the effect of scale. The development of solid state lighting solutions
   enables highly effective modernization of street lighting installations.
   It allows obtaining power saving not only by replacing high pressure
   lamps with LEDs but also by improving a design quality and by
   introducing a dynamic street lighting control. Both methods, however,
   are not feasible for industry-standard software tools due to the
   significant complexity related to a configuration optimization,
   especially for large-scale projects. The goal of this article is
   presenting the workaround to the complexity issue, which is based on
   application of graph methods. They enable optimizing lighting
   installations in the scale of a city by providing a scalable
   computational environment. The presented case study shows that, thanks
   to applying the proposed method, one can design a lighting system which
   has the energy consumption reduced by up to 70\%.}},

Title = {{Adaptive Kalman Filter Based on Adjustable Sampling Interval in Burst
   Detection for Water Distribution System}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Rapid detection of bursts and leaks in water distribution systems (WDSs)
   can reduce the social and economic costs incurred through direct loss of
   water into the ground, additional energy demand for water supply, and
   service interruptions. Many real-time burst detection models have been
   developed in accordance with the use of supervisory control and data
   acquisition (SCADA) systems and the establishment of district meter
   areas (DMAs). Nonetheless, no consideration has been given to how
   frequently a flow meter measures and transmits data for predicting
   breaks and leaks in pipes. This paper analyzes the effect of sampling
   interval when an adaptive Kalman filter is used for detecting bursts in
   a WDS. A new sampling algorithm is presented that adjusts the sampling
   interval depending on the normalized residuals of flow after filtering.
   The proposed algorithm is applied to a virtual sinusoidal flow curve and
   real DMA flow data obtained from Jeongeup city in South Korea. The
   simulation results prove that the self-adjusting algorithm for
   determining the sampling interval is efficient and maintains reasonable
   accuracy in burst detection. The proposed sampling method has a
   significant potential for water utilities to build and operate real-time
   DMA monitoring systems combined with smart customer metering systems.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary patterns of urbanization come with many challenges
   regarding the quality of urban life, especially with respect to the
   provision of urban infrastructures and housing, exposure to
   environmental risks and urban inequalities. In International Development
   Studies (IDS) it is understood that addressing these issues (both in
   terms of research and in practice) requires disaggregated and local
   spatial knowledge on the dynamics of urban populations, conditions,
   resources and flows. Geo-technologies such as remote sensing imagery or
   spatial simulation models have the capacity to provide this knowledge,
   but are endowed with certain risks and limitations. Using three
   illustrative examples this article discusses the potential and
   limitations of geo-technologies for addressing contemporary urban issues
   and how such technologies influence future development research. It
   shows that geo-technologies can produce disaggregated spatial and
   temporal knowledge, but should also include place and space
   specificities and cross-disciplinary boundaries in order to be useful.
   As IDS researchers have built-up considerable knowledge, expertise and
   networks on the ground, they can and should contribute to spatially
   contextualizing data-and technology-driven research.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the increased visibility of urban infrastructures
   occurring through a close coupling of information technologies and the
   selective integration of urban services. It asks how circulatory flow is
   managed in the contemporary city, by focusing on the emergence of new
   forms of governmentality associated with smart technologies. Drawing on
   Foucault's governmentality, and based on a case study of Rio de
   Janeiro's Operations Centre (COR), the paper argues that new
   understandings of the city are being developed, representing a new mode
   of urban infrastructure based on the partial and selective rebundling of
   splintered networks and fragmented urban space. The COR operates through
   a un-black boxing of urban infrastructures, where the extension of
   control room logics to the totality of the city points to their
   fragility and the continuous effort involved in their operational
   accomplishment. It also functions through a collapse in relations of
   controlof the everyday and the emergency, which, enabled by the
   incorporation of the public in operational control, further raise public
   awareness of urban infrastructures. These characteristics point to a
   specific form of urban governmentality based on the operationalisation
   of infrastructural flows and the development of novel ways of seeing and
   engaging with the city.}},

Abstract = {{Cities are complex environments in which digital technologies are more
   and more pervasive; this digitization of the urban space has led to a
   rich ecosystem of data producers and data consumers. Moreover,
   heterogeneous sources differ in terms of data complexity,
   spatio-temporal resolution and curation/maintenance costs. Do those
   diverse urban sources reflect the same picture of the city? Do distinct
   perspectives share some commonalities?
   In this paper we present our data analytics/empirical experiments on a
   set of urban sources related to the city of Milano; our investigation is
   aimed at discovering ``affinities{''} between datasets by means of
   different quantitative and qualitative correlation analyses. We also
   explore the influence of spatial resolution and data complexity on the
   dependence strength between heterogeneous urban sources, to pave the way
   to a meaningful information fusion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A new methodology for urban wind resource assessment}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{598-605}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In the latest years the wind energy sector experienced an exponential
   growth all over the world. What started as a deployment of onshore
   projects, soon moved to offshore and, more recently to the urban
   environment within the context of smart cities and renewable
   micro-generation. However, urban wind projects using micro turbines do
   not have enough profit margins to enable the setup of comprehensive and
   expensive measurement campaigns, a standard procedure for the deployment
   of large wind parks. To respond to the wind assessment needs of the
   future smart cities a new and simple methodology for urban wind resource
   assessment was developed. This methodology is based on the construction
   of a surface involving a built area in order to estimate the wind
   potential by treating it as very complex orography. This is a
   straightforward methodology that allows estimating the sustainable urban
   wind potential, being suitable to map the urban wind resource in large
   areas. The methodology was applied to a case study and the results
   enabled the wind potential assessment of a large urban area being
   consistent with experimental data obtained in the case study area, with
   maximum deviations of the order of 10\% (mean wind speed) and 20\%
   (power density). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Improvements of energy efficiency and reduction of Electricity
   Consumption (EC) could be pushed by increased knowledge on consumption
   profiles. This paper contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the
   EC profiles in a Southwest European city through the combination of
   high-resolution data from smart meters (daily electricity consumption)
   with door-to-door 110-question surveys for a sample of 265 households in
   the city of Evora, in Portugal. This analysis allowed to define ten
   power consumption clusters using Ward's method hierarchical clustering,
   corresponding to four distinct types of annual consumption profiles: U
   shape (sharp and soft), W shape and Flat. U shape pattern is the most
   common one, covering 77\% of the sampled households.
   The results show that three major groups of determinants characterize
   the electricity consumption segmentation: physical characteristics of a
   dwelling, especially year of construction and floor area; HVAC equipment
   and fireplaces ownership and use; and occupants' profiles (mainly number
   and monthly income).
   The combination of the daily EC data with qualitative door-to-door
   survey-based data proved to be a powerful data nutshell to distinguish
   groups of power consumers, allowing to derive insights to support DSOs,
   ESCOs, and retailers to design measures and instruments targeted to
   effective energy reduction (e.g. peak shaving, energy efficiency). (C)

   signaling procedures of the network is key. In this work we study the
   location update procedure in WiMAX networks. Whilst previous works
   consider 1-D layouts of base stations (BSs), corresponding to ITS-based
   scenarios, we focus on extending that scenario to develop an analytical
   model for 2-D layouts, which fit better for cities. Our model consider
   the two cases in which the logical entity in charge of handling the
   location tracking and paging operations, known as anchor paging
   controller (APC), is assigned for a mobile station (MS) during a
   location update: when the old APC is reassigned (no relocation), and
   when a new APC is assigned (relocation). The comparison is made by
   calculating the cost (as the number of exchanged messages) of the
   location update procedure in each case. We validate our model through
   simulations, and discuss the impact on the final cost of several
   parameters, such as type and frequency of the movements. Finally, we
   provide some guidelines on how to assign the APC depending on the
   network parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A methodological framework for multiple steps ahead parking availability
   prediction is presented. Two different types of predictions are
   provided: the probability of a free space to continue being free in
   subsequent time intervals, and the short-term parking occupancy
   prediction in selected regions of an urban road network. The available
   data come from a wide network of on-street parking sensors in the
   ``smart{''} city of Santander, Spain. The sensor network is segmented in
   four different regions, and then survival and neural network models are
   developed for each region separately. Findings show that the Weibull
   parametric models best describe the probability of a parking space to
   continue to be free in the forthcoming time intervals. Moreover, simple
   genetically optimized multilayer perceptrons accurately predict region
   parking occupancy rates up to 30 minutes in the future by exploiting
   1-minute data. Finally, the real time, Web-based, implementation of the
   proposed parking prediction availability system is presented.}},

Title = {{Lightweight CoAP-Based Bootstrapping Service for the Internet of Things}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming increasingly important in
   several fields of industrial applications and personal applications,
   such as medical e-health, smart cities, etc. The research into protocols
   and security aspects related to this area is continuously advancing in
   making these networks more reliable and secure, taking into account
   these aspects by design. Bootstrapping is a procedure by which a user
   obtains key material and configuration information, among other
   parameters, to operate as an authenticated party in a security domain.
   Until now solutions have focused on re-using security protocols that
   were not developed for IoT constraints. For this reason, in this work we
   propose a design and implementation of a lightweight bootstrapping
   service for IoT networks that leverages one of the application protocols
   used in IoT : Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Additionally, in
   order to provide flexibility, scalability, support for large scale
   deployment, accountability and identity federation, our design uses
   technologies such as the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and
   Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA). We have named this
   service CoAP-EAP. First, we review the state of the art in the field of
   bootstrapping and specifically for IoT. Second, we detail the
   bootstrapping service: the architecture with entities and interfaces and
   the flow operation. Third, we obtain performance measurements of
   CoAP-EAP (bootstrapping time, memory footprint, message processing time,
   message length and energy consumption) and compare them with PANATIKI.
   The most significant and constrained representative of the bootstrapping
   solutions related with CoAP-EAP. As we will show, our solution provides
   significant improvements, mainly due to an important reduction of the
   message length.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread diffusion of sensors, mobile devices, social media and
   open data are reconfiguring the way data underpinning policy and science
   are being produced and consumed. This in turn is creating both
   opportunities and challenges for policy-making and science. There can be
   major benefits from the deployment of the IoT in smart cities and
   environmental monitoring, but to realize such benefits, and reduce
   potential risks, there is an urgent need to address current limitations,
   including the interoperability of sensors, data quality, security of
   access and new methods for spatio-temporal analysis. Within this
   context, the manuscript provides an overview of the AirSensEUR project,
   which establishes an affordable open software/hardware multi-sensor
   platform, which is nonetheless able to monitor air pollution at low
   concentration levels. AirSensEUR is described from the perspective of
   interoperable data management with emphasis on possible use case
   scenarios, where reliable and timely air quality data would be

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{116}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Knowing how individuals move between places is fundamental to advance
   our understanding of human mobility (Gonzalez et al. 2008 Nature 453,
   779-782. (doi: 10.1038/nature06958)), improve our urban infrastructure
   (Prato 2009 J. Choice Model. 2, 65-100. (doi: 10.1016/S1755-5345(13)
   70005-8)) and drive the development of transportation systems. Current
   route-choice models that are used in transportation planning are based
   on the widely accepted assumption that people follow the minimum cost
   path (Wardrop 1952 Proc. Inst. Civ. Eng. 1, 325-362. (doi:
   10.1680/ipeds.1952.11362)), despite little empirical support.
   Fine-grained location traces collected by smart devices give us today an
   unprecedented opportunity to learn how citizens organize their travel
   plans into a set of routes, and how similar behaviour patterns emerge
   among distinct individual choices. Here we study 92 419 anonymized GPS
   trajectories describing the movement of personal cars over an 18-month
   period. We group user trips by origin-destination and we find that most
   drivers use a small number of routes for their routine journeys, and
   tend to have a preferred route for frequent trips. In contrast to the
   cost minimization assumption, we also find that a significant fraction
   of drivers' routes are not optimal. We present a spatial probability
   distribution that bounds the route selection space within an ellipse,
   having the origin and the destination as focal points, characterized by
   high eccentricity independent of the scale. While individual routing
   choices are not captured by path optimization, their spatial bounds are
   similar, even for trips performed by distinct individuals and at various
   scales. These basic discoveries can inform realistic route-choice models
   that are not based on optimization, having an impact on several
   applications, such as infrastructure planning, routing recommendation
   systems and new mobility solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Smart, green, and resilient city paradigms have been mainly promoted
   through top-down and technocratic approaches. However, based on the
   notion to return to ``the right to the city{''}, emerging
   community-driven initiatives are providing self-managed infrastructures
   contributing to urban sustainability transitions. This paper explores
   the relevance of the behavioral aspects of people-centered approaches in
   dealing with two different facets of urban metabolism: physical
   infrastructure (involvement with the management of decentralized
   infrastructures) and consumption patterns (involvement in proactive
   reduction of resources used). In the first case we assessed community
   perceptions about the roles, benefits, and willingness to proactively
   engage in the management of decentralized green infrastructures in
   Bogota City, Colombia. For the second facet, we measured the
   effectiveness of change agents in re-shaping energy consumption
   decisions within urban social networks in South Africa and Saudi Arabia.
   This paper's results show that pre-determined and standardized
   strategies do not guarantee positive, nor homogeneous, results in terms
   of meeting sustainability targets, or promoting community involvement.
   Hence, a better integration of people-centered and top-down approaches
   is needed through context-dependent policies, for enhancing both users'
   appreciation of and commitment to urban metabolism participative
   management.}},

Abstract = {{We propose key performance indicators (KPIs) based on the Gross Social
   Feel-Good Index to evaluate a smart sustainable city and report the
   results of a field trial in a city located almost at the center of the
   Tokyo Metropolitan Area. We developed KPIs based on the following
   concepts: (1). The triple bottom line is the basic evaluation criteria;
   (2). The same unit is used for every evaluation criterion; (3). The KPIs
   can be used to assess a diverse range of smart sustainable cities with
   different goals. With the proposed KPIs of smart sustainable cities,
   indicators are divided into four layers for simplicity: the triple
   bottom line and ``satisfaction{''} lie in the first layer. Since the
   notion of ``society{''} is broad, it is further split into ``safety{''},
   ``health{''}, and ``comfort{''}, which are positioned in the second
   layer. The third layer includes indicators such as ``information
   security{''} and ``ubiquitous society{''} from the perspective of
   information communication technology (ICT). We conducted a trial
   evaluation by applying the proposed KPIs to individual ICT solutions of
   ``Internet Protocol announcements{''}, ``Wi-Fi around the station{''}
   and ``information transmission and control{''} which have already been
   installed in a smart sustainable city.}},

Abstract = {{This paper builds upon an earlier conference publication by the authors,
   offering contributions based on a systematic literature review and
   qualitative study. The paper begins by drawing attention to the paucity
   of ``citizen{''}-more appropriately, ``situated{''}-perspectives on what
   a smart city should and could be. The paper then addresses that absence
   by detailing a research project that explored how people in London,
   Manchester, and Glasgow responded to the smart city concept.
   Participants were asked questions regarding their prior familiarity with
   the phrase ``smart city{''}, their thoughts relating to what it means
   for a city to be smart, and what a ``true{''} smart city might mean to
   them. The paper analyses and offers a synthesis of the responses
   collected throughout the research with the dominant rhetoric about smart
   cities, as identified through a recent systematic literature review,
   thereby providing a critical assessment of the values underlying the
   smart city. It aims to explore and present some of the expectations that
   citizens hold for their cities' politicians, policy makers, planners,
   academics, and technology companies. We believe that these perspectives
   from citizens can be used to inform responsible development, spatially
   and socially inclusive technologies, and ultimately more resilient
   cities.}},

Abstract = {{The technologies related to green energy, smart cities and similar areas
   being dynamically developed in recent years, face frequently problems of
   a computational nature rather than a technological one. The example is
   the ability of accurately predicting the weather conditions for PV farms
   or wind turbines. Another group of issues is related to the complexity
   of the computations required to obtain an optimal setup of a solution
   being designed. In this article, we present the case representing the
   latter group of problems, namely designing large-scale power-saving
   lighting installations. The term large-scale refers to an entire city
   area, containing tens of thousands of luminaires. Although a simple
   power reduction for a single street, giving limited savings, is
   relatively easy, it becomes infeasible for tasks covering thousands of
   luminaires described by precise coordinates (instead of simplified
   layouts). To overcome this critical issue, we propose introducing a
   formal representation of a computing problem and applying a multi-agent
   system to perform design-related computations in parallel. The important
   measure introduced in the article indicating optimization progress is
   entropy. It also allows for terminating optimization when the solution
   is satisfying. The article contains the results of real-life
   calculations being made with the help of the presented approach.}},

Abstract = {{Contactless smart card systems have gained universal prevalence in
   modern metros. In addition to its original goal of ticketing, the large
   amount of transaction data collected by the smart card system can be
   utilized for many operational and management purposes. This paper
   investigates an important problem: how to extract spatiotemporal
   segmentation information of trips inside a metro system. More
   specifically, for a given trip, we want to answer several key questions:
   How long does it take for a passenger to walk from the station gantry to
   the station platform? How much time does he/she wait for the next train?
   How long does he/she spend on the train? How long does it take to
   transfer from one line to another? This segmentation information is
   important for many application scenarios such as travel time prediction,
   travel planning, and transportation scheduling. However, in reality, we
   only assume that only each trip's tap-in and tap-out time can be
   directly obtained; all other temporal endpoints of segments are unknown.
   This makes the research very challenging. To the best of our knowledge,
   we are the first to give a practical solution to this important problem.
   By analyzing the tap-in/tap-out event pattern, our intuition is to
   pinpoint some special passengers whose transaction data can be very
   helpful for segmentation. A novel methodology is proposed to extract
   spatiotemporal segmentation information: first, for nontransfer trips,
   by deriving the boarding time between the gantry and the platform, and
   then, for withtransfer trips, by deriving the transfer time. Evaluation
   studies are based on large-scale real-system data of the Shenzhen metro
   system, which is one of the largest metro systems in China and serves
   millions of passengers daily. Onsite investigations validate that our
   algorithm is accurate and that the average estimation error is only
   around 15\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to better understand urban partnerships through the
   nature of the interactions between their stakeholders. Following a
   review of approaches to stakeholder arrangements in urban partnerships,
   which draws on a variety of literatures, including strategic management,
   public administration, urban studies and geography, the paper presents
   results of an action-case study undertaken in an urban partnership
   context-namely, Houldsworth Village Partnership (HVP) - within the
   Greater Manchester region of the UK. The findings begin by classifying
   HVP stakeholders along broad sectoral lines, before moving to examine,
   through a thematic analysis of data, the influences on their
   interactions in terms of `process enablers' and `inhibitors'. This leads
   to a schema, whereby HVP stakeholder interactions are conceptualized on
   the dual continua of attitude and behavior. The schema provides a
   theoretical contribution by offering an understanding of stakeholders'
   dynamic interplay within an urban partnership context, and a means of
   classifying such stakeholders beyond their individual/organizational
   characteristics or sectoral affiliations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A smart city provides its people with high standard of living through
   advanced technologies, and transport is one of the major foci. With the
   advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs), an AV-based public transportation
   system has been proposed recently, which is capable of providing new
   forms of transportation services with high efficiency, high flexibility,
   and low cost. For the benefit of passengers, multi-tenancy can increase
   market competition leading to lower service charge and higher quality of
   service. In this paper, we study the pricing issue of themulti-tenant AV
   public transportation system and three types of services are defined.
   The pricing process for each service type is modeled as a combinatorial
   auction, in which the service providers, as bidders, compete for
   offering transportation services. The winners of the auction are
   determined through an integer linear program. To prevent the bidders
   from raising their bids for higher returns, we propose a strategy-proof
   Vickrey-Clarke-Groves-based charging mechanism, which can maximize the
   social welfare, to settle the final charges for the customers. We
   perform extensive simulations to verify the analytical results and
   evaluate the performance of the charging mechanism.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{62}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{With the rise of smart cities people are moving within urban spaces and
   still be able to pervasively interact with information, services, city's
   resources and other people. In such a highly connected scenario,
   smartphones and other wireless portable devices are carried by humans,
   exhibit the same mobility behaviour of their human carriers and their
   movements strongly impact on the underlying network operation and
   performance. The understanding of human mobility in an urban space has
   become crucial to optimize the network management, to plan the adaptive
   allocation of critical resources and ensure constant quality of the user
   experience. This paper takes a first step in the direction of the design
   of a mobility model meeting behavioural and scale requirements of modern
   smart cities. We envision a smart city as a collection of places, each
   representing a Point of Interest (PoI) with specific value for single
   individuals and for a set of them. As a consequence, each individual has
   his/her own mobility footprint, while few of them share similar mobility
   patterns. By simulating the mobility of each individual across city's
   places, we will be able to properly describe human mobility and social
   behaviour in urban spaces, and to extract all needed information about
   how city's resources and services are accessed. The extensive use of
   CDR, GPS and WiFi traces, enables us to analyse the characteristics of
   city's Points of Interest (PoI), classify them for each individual
   according to their importance and study how the individuals move across
   them. The common features observed are the key points to build a
   metropolitan mobility simulator able to reproduce the regularity in
   spatio-temporal behaviour of mobile users and also how city sociality is
   built around PoIs of the city. The simulator exhibits high flexibility
   and can be applied in wide geographical and population scales. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The public transport networks of dense cities such as London serve
   passengers with widely different travel patterns. In line with the
   diverse lives of urban dwellers, activities and journeys are combined
   within days and across days in diverse sequences. From personalized
   customer information, to improved travel demand models, understanding
   this type of heterogeneity among transit users is relevant to a number
   of applications core to public transport agencies' function. In this
   study, passenger heterogeneity is investigated based on a longitudinal
   representation of each user's multi-week activity sequence derived from
   smart card data. We propose a methodology leveraging this representation
   to identify clusters of users with similar activity sequence structure.
   The methodology is applied to a large sample (n = 33,026) from London's
   public transport network, in which each passenger is represented by a
   continuous 4-week activity sequence. The application reveals 11
   clusters, each characterized by a distinct sequence structure.
   Socio-demographic information available for a small sample of users (n =
   1973) is combined to smart card transactions to analyze associations
   between the identified patterns and demographic attributes including
   passenger age, occupation, household composition and income, and vehicle
   ownership. The analysis reveals that significant connections exist
   between the demographic attributes of users and activity patterns
   identified exclusively from fare transactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we evaluate how to provide or control traffic information
   based on anticipatory stigmergy. Managing traffic congestion is one of
   the main issues for smart cities, and many efforts have been made to
   address it from the perspective of IT and transportation research.
   Recently, dynamic coordination methods have been made possible by using
   shorter term traffic information that can be gathered by probe vehicles
   or smartphones. Some attempts have been made to handle short-term
   traffic information in which a stigmergy-based approach is employed as
   an indirect communication method for cooperation among distributed
   agents and for managing traffic congestion. One drawback of these
   approaches is that handling near-future congestion remains difficult
   because stigmergies basically represent past information. Therefore, we
   propose anticipatory stigmergy for sharing information about the near
   future and adequate driver allocation. All vehicles submit their
   near-future intentions as anticipatory stigmergy in order to search for
   routes. Preliminary results demonstrate that anticipatory stigmergy with
   an assignment strategy functions well.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The smart city concept is often simply considered equivalent only to
   technology. This paper starts by introducing the necessity of a
   holistic, integrated, and multidisciplinary approach to the concept of
   smart cities. Smart cities are evolving by the creation of tools that
   are application specific; therefore, European classification of smart
   city applications will be reviewed (as authors have used these criteria
   to classify the analyzed applications) and the relationship between the
   different European smart classification standards are analyzed.
   Moreover, in order to see how reality aligns with the theoretical
   concept of smart cities, the authors analyzed 61 applications from 33
   smart cities distributed in North America, South America, Europe and
   Asia. From these, 16 specific applications from eight cities have been
   selected and described in detail so they provide an overview of existing
   tools in different application areas, as defined by European standards.
   After showing actual smart cities, the concepts and steps for building
   future smart cities are suggested in a conclusion. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{The idea of smart cities is to a great extent based on the belief of

   concentrate on gaining an understanding of informational territories
   built to support surveillance and control of public spaces. We seek to
   question this relation by making reference to several specific uses of
   information and communication technologies for surveillance purposes and
   to discuss it from the point of view of definitions of territory. Our
   goal is to discuss the fact that, under the mantra' of smarter cities
   and on the grounds of public security, there is a scattering of micro

Abstract = {{Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) are two very different
   technologies that are both already part of our life. Their adoption and
   use are expected to be more and more pervasive, making them important
   components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and loT
   are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and as an enabler of a
   large number of application scenarios. In this paper, we focus our
   attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which is what we call the
   CloudloT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT
   separately and, more precisely, their main properties, features,
   underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our
   knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the new CloudloT
   paradigm, which involves completely new applications, challenges, and
   research issues. To bridge this gap, in this paper we provide a
   literature survey on the integration of Cloud and IoT. Starting by
   analyzing the basics of both IoT and Cloud Computing, we discuss their
   complementarity, detailing what is currently driving to their
   integration. Thanks to the adoption of the CloudloT paradigm a number of
   applications are gaining momentum: we provide an up-to-date picture of
   CloudloT applications in literature, with a focus on their specific
   research challenges. These challenges are then analyzed in details to
   show where the main body of research is currently heading. We also
   discuss what is already available in terms of platforms - both
   proprietary and open source - and projects implementing the CloudloT
   paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions in this
   field, which we expect to play a leading role in the landscape of the
   Future Internet. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the near future, the Internet of Things is expected to penetrate all
   aspects of the physical world, including homes and urban spaces. In
   order to handle the massive amount of data that becomes collectible and
   to offer services on top of this data, the most convincing solution is
   the federation of the Internet of Things and cloud computing. Yet, the
   wide adoption of this promising vision, especially for application areas
   such as pervasive health care, assisted living, and smart cities, is
   hindered by severe privacy concerns of the individual users. Hence, user
   acceptance is a critical factor to turn this vision into reality. To
   address this critical factor and thus realize the cloud-based Internet
   of Things for a variety of different application areas, we present our
   comprehensive approach to privacy in this envisioned setting. We allow
   an individual user to enforce all her privacy requirements before any
   sensitive data is uploaded to the cloud, enable developers of cloud
   services to integrate privacy functionality already into the development
   process of cloud services, and offer users a transparent and adaptable
   interface for configuring their privacy requirements. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A smart city is a sustainable and efficient urban centre that provides a
   high quality of life to its inhabitants through optimal management of
   its resources. Energy management is one of the most demanding issues
   within such urban centres owing to the complexity of the energy systems
   and their vital role. Therefore, significant attention and effort need
   to be dedicated to this problem. Modelling and simulation are the major
   tools commonly used to assess the technological and policy impacts of
   smart solutions, as well as to plan the best ways of shifting from
   current cities to smarter ones.
   This paper reviews energy-related work on planning and operation models
   within the smart city by classifying their scope into five main
   intervention areas: generation, storage, infrastructure, facilities, and
   transport. More-complex urban energy models integrating more than one
   intervention area are also reviewed, outlining their advantages and
   limitations, existing trends and challenges, and some relevant
   applications. Lastly, a methodology for developing an improved energy

Abstract = {{The next-generation electricity grid ({''}smart grid{''}) is expected to
   integrate interoperable technologies particularly in the energy,
   transport, information and communication fields - with the aim to
   increase reliability, affordability and sustainability considering at
   the same time, distribution systems and market operation. In order to
   gauge the implications of the anticipated paradigm shift for the
   electricity system, new reference architectures and assessment
   methodologies shall be developed to properly capture the interactions
   between the different actors (especially utilities, operators, energy
   aggregators, end-users, etc.) and technologies to value and allocate the
   costs and benefits of such transformation. Against this background, this
   paper proposes a conceptual architecture and an assessment framework to
   explore how high penetration scenarios of electric vehicles and
   intermittent renewable generation can complement each other in emerging
   distribution networks. We start from the identification of the smart
   grid functionalities to be implemented in a system with distributed
   power injections under the need to supervise and coordinate myriads of
   decentralized and interoperable energy sources and actors. Relying upon
   the proposed smart grid conceptual architecture, we develop an
   assessment framework to maximize the renewable electricity and electric
   vehicle penetration for given electricity and transport systems. The
   application of the proposed assessment framework to a realistic case
   study, representing the distribution and mobility systems of a typical
   mid-size Italian city, illustrates how some of the limitations and
   constraints of the current electricity network operation and design
   approaches can be addressed and overcome. We show how integration of
   substantial amounts of energy production and electric-based transport
   technologies can be achieved while improving the reliability and
   sustainability performances of the emerging power systems. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Effective and efficient matching of supply and demand of materials and
   energy with consideration of spatial allocation is essential to realize
   low-carbon city planning with high material-and energy-use efficiency.
   Implementing real-time action management can contribute to smart system

   established by using information about regional spatial characteristics,
   such as land use, infrastructure installation, production, and
   livelihood. Moreover, an appropriate methodology for operating and
   designing the energy material circulation system will also be required.
   Here, we examined the possibility of collecting various types of spatial
   information on cities and considered the use of existing databases for
   designing an energy circulation system in one region of Japan. We
   introduced an innovative information network system integrating a
   regional geographical information system and information and

Abstract = {{Industry plays as a double-edged sword that can contribute to both gross
   domestic product (GDP) and pollution, thus the concept of eco-industrial
   development which emphasize the environmental cleanness in economy
   development has received more and more attentions recently. Different
   from the traditional development mode which merely relocating industries
   outside of the cities for pursuing sustainable development,
   eco-industrial development makes significant innovation by treating or
   utilizing wastes (i.e. solid wastes and waste energy) in a smart way for
   local industries to achieve a win win situation. In order to investigate
   the eco-benefits of eco-industrial development in China, this study
   focused on an industrial and urban symbiosis case of Guiyang city in
   which process synergy, municipal solid wastes recycling and waste energy
   utilization were incorporated in this typical industrial city. This city
   is resource-dependent, has many heavy industries, and these severely
   hinder sustainable development in this city. In order to promote
   eco-industrial development, an integrated coal, electricity, aluminum,
   phosphor chemical, iron/steel industry and urban symbiosis network was
   firstly designed, with linkages between various industries through
   energy exchanges and process synergies. Subsequently, a quantitative
   assessment on the life cycle environmental benefits were further
   conducted. Then, we found that a dramatic resource saving and carbon
   dioxide emission reduction can be achieved. Finally, some policy
   implications to address the barriers of promoting industrial and urban
   symbiosis were proposed. This study is critical for future industrial
   and urban planning policy making and shed a light on innovative

Abstract = {{Urban wind energy exploitation is an important topic for smart
   sustainable cities. The present investigation is a step in this
   direction, considering the latest advances in building aerodynamics,
   identifying and analyzing the optimum building-roof shape for the urban
   wind energy exploitation. This investigation focusses in two aspects:
   the isolated building shape optimization and the analysis of this
   building in an urban environment. The optimization includes an analysis
   of the roof-wall transition geometry by testing different variations of
   a spherical roof, a roof-width sensitivity analysis of the optimum
   geometry and an exploration of the building aspect ratio effect on the
   flow. A comparison of velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulence
   intensity is carried out. The wind turbine positioning on the roof is
   analyzed in detail. An exactly spherical roof connected to a cylindrical
   wall is identified as the most advantageous option. Additionally, the
   effect of the neighboring buildings is investigated considering
   different heights for the surroundings. The wind flow on the roof is
   strongly affected by the presence of surrounding buildings, increasing
   the turbulence intensity close to the roof surface. Slender shapes are
   identified as the most interesting building shapes for wind energy
   exploitation, leading to a higher speed-up and to a lower turbulence
   intensity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Variability in Regularity: Mining Temporal Mobility Patterns in London,
   Singapore and Beijing Using Smart-Card Data}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{To discover regularities in human mobility is of fundamental importance
   to our understanding of urban dynamics, and essential to city and
   transport planning, urban management and policymaking. Previous research
   has revealed universal regularities at mainly aggregated spatio-temporal
   scales but when we zoom into finer scales, considerable heterogeneity
   and diversity is observed instead. The fundamental question we address
   in this paper is at what scales are the regularities we detect stable,
   explicable, and sustainable. This paper thus proposes a basic measure of
   variability to assess the stability of such regularities focusing mainly
   on changes over a range of temporal scales. We demonstrate this by
   comparing regularities in the urban mobility patterns in three world
   cities, namely London, Singapore and Beijing using one-week of
   smart-card data. The results show that variations in regularity scale as
   non-linear functions of the temporal resolution, which we measure over a
   scale from 1 minute to 24 hours thus reflecting the diurnal cycle of
   human mobility. A particularly dramatic increase in variability occurs
   up to the temporal scale of about 15 minutes in all three cities and
   this implies that limits exist when we look forward or backward with
   respect to making short-term predictions. The degree of regularity
   varies in fact from city to city with Beijing and Singapore showing
   higher regularity in comparison to London across all temporal scales. A
   detailed discussion is provided, which relates the analysis to various
   characteristics of the three cities. In summary, this work contributes
   to a deeper understanding of regularities in patterns of transit use
   from variations in volumes of travellers entering subway stations, it
   establishes a generic analytical framework for comparative studies using
   urban mobility data, and it provides key points for the management of
   variability by policy-makers intent on for making the travel experience
   more amenable.}},

   according to the AWS (1997) guidelines and computed at 60 m.a.g.l using
   the power law formula. At this height, the average wind speeds was
   approximately 6.5 m/s, which was considered cost effective, as per the
   European Wind Energy Union guidelines for the harvesting of wind power.
   Estimated yearly power generated by a wind farm consisting of 40 wind
   turbines, each of rating capacity 275 kW, placed at a hub height of 60 m
   were made. The study resulted in an investment proposal for a 11 MW wind
   farm project in Mauritius.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present a framework based on a prediction model that
   facilitates user access to a number of services in a smart living
   environment. Users must be able to access all available services
   continuously equipped with mobile devices or smart objects without being
   impacted by technical constraints such as performance or memory issues,
   regardless of their physical location and mobility. To achieve this
   goal, we propose the use of cloudlet-based architecture that serves as
   distributed cloud resources with specific ranges of influence and a
   realtime processing framework that tracks events and preferences of the
   end consumers, predicts their requirements, and recommends services to
   optimize resource utilization and service response time.}},

Abstract = {{Smart cities are a modern administrative/developmental concept that
   tries to combine the development of urban areas with a higher level of

   willingness to introduce the elements of smart cities into two Central
   and Eastern European cities is tested. The results show that people are
   reluctant to use technology above the level of their needs and show
   little interest in participating in matters of governance, which
   prevents smart cities from developing in reality.}},

Abstract = {{Current logistics and transportation (L\&T) systems include
   heterogeneous fleets consisting of common internal combustion engine
   vehicles as well as other types of vehicles using green technologies,
   e.g., plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs).
   However, the incorporation of EVs in L\&T activities also raise some
   additional challenges from the strategic, planning, and operational
   perspectives. For instance, smart cities are required to provide
   recharge stations for electric-based vehicles, meaning that investment
   decisions need to be made about the number, location, and capacity of
   these stations. Similarly, the limited driving-range capabilities of
   EVs, which are restricted by the amount of electricity stored in their
   batteries, impose non-trivial additional constraints when designing
   efficient distribution routes. Accordingly, this paper identifies and
   reviews several open research challenges related to the introduction of
   EVs in L\&T activities, including: (a) environmental-related issues; and
   (b) strategic, planning and operational issues associated with standard
   EVs and with hydrogen-based EVs. The paper also analyzes how the
   introduction of EVs in L\&T systems generates new variants of the
   well-known Vehicle Routing Problem, one of the most studied optimization
   problems in the L\&T field, and proposes the use of metaheuristics and
   simheuristics as the most efficient way to deal with these complex
   optimization problems.}},

Abstract = {{The holy grail of smart cities is an integrated, sustainable approach to
   improve the efficiency of the city's operations and the quality of life

   indirectly. Despite the recent surge of research and smart cities
   initiatives in practice, there are still a number of challenges to
   overcome in realizing this vision. This position paper points out six

   of citizens' data literacy, the pairing of quantitative and qualitative
   data, the need for open standards, the development of personal services,
   and the development of persuasive interfaces. The article furthermore
   advocates the use of methods and techniques from GIScience to tackle
   these challenges, and presents the concept of an Open City Toolkit as a

Abstract = {{This paper shows how to recover the arrival times of trains from the
   gate times of metro passengers from Smart Card data. Such technique is
   essential when a log, the set of records indicating the actual arrival
   and departure time of each bus or train at each station and also a
   critical component in reliability analysis of a transportation system,
   is missing partially or entirely. The procedure reconstructs each train
   as a sequence of the earliest exit times, called S-epochs, among its
   alighting passengers at each stations. The procedure first constructs a
   set of passengers, also known as reference passengers, whose routing
   choices are easily identifiable. The procedure then computes, from the
   exit times of the reference passengers, a set of tentative S-epochs
   based on a detection measure whose validity relies on an extreme-value
   characteristic of the platform-to-gatemovement of alighting passengers.
   The tentative S-epochs are then finalized to be a true one, or rejected,
   based on their consistencies with bounds and/or interpolation from
   prescribed 5-epochs of adjacent trains and stations. Tested on 12 daily
   sets of trains, with varying degrees of missing logs, from three entire
   metro lines, the method restored the arrival times of 95\% of trains
   within the error of 24 s even when 100\% of logs was missing. The mining
   procedure can also be applied to trains operating under special
   strategies such as short-turning and skip-stop. The recovered log seems
   precise enough for the current reliability analysis performed by the
   city of Seoul. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The collection of origin-destination data for a city is an important but
   often costly task. This way, there is a need to develop more efficient
   and inexpensive methods of collecting information about citizens' travel
   patterns. In this line, this paper presents a generic methodology that
   allows to infer the origin and destination zones for an observed trip
   between two public transport stops (i.e., bus stops or metro stations)
   using socioeconomic, land use, and network information. The proposed
   zonal inference model follows a disaggregated Logit approach including
   size variables. The model enables the estimation of a zonal
   origin-destination matrix for a city, if trip information passively
   collected by a smart-card payment system is available (in form of a
   stop-to-stop matrix). The methodology is applied to the Santiago de
   Chile's morning peak period, with the purpose of serving as input for a
   public transport planning computational tool. To estimate the model,
   information was gathered from different sources and processed into a
   unified framework; data included a survey conducted at public transport
   stops, land use information, and a stop to -stop trip matrix.
   Additionally, a zonal system with 1176 zones was constructed for the
   city, including the definition of its access links and associated
   distances. Our results shows that, ceteris paribus, zones with high
   numbers of housing units have higher probabilities of being the origin
   of a morning peak trip. Likewise, health facilities, educational,
   residential, commercial, and offices centres have significant attraction
   powers during this period. In this sense, our model manages to capture
   the expected effects of land use on trip generation and attraction. This
   study has numerous policy implications, as the information obtained can
   be used to predict the impacts of changes in the public transport
   network (such as extending routes, relocating their stops, designing new
   routes or changing the fare structure). Further research is needed to
   improve the zonal inference formulation and origin-destination matrix
   estimation, mainly by including better cost measures, and dealing with
   survey and data limitations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Istanbul: the challenges of integrated water resources management in

Abstract = {{Effective integrated water resources management (IWRM) and developments
   impacting on water resources are recognized as key components of
   environmentally sustainable development. Istanbul (Turkey) is a very
   large metropolitan city with a population of approximately 14 million.
   Istanbul is one of the 23 megacities (metropolitan areas with a
   population of more than 10 million) in the world and one of the most
   rapidly growing cities in Europe. The annual population growth is 2.8
   \%. The population growth in the city is almost twice the overall rate
   of the whole of Turkey, because of a large in-migration. The present
   study is a baseline assessment of IWRM of Istanbul and also provides a
   critical review of Istanbul's future challenges. The assessment is part
   of an action on water governance (City Blueprints) in the context of the
   European Innovation Partnership on Water of the European Commission. The
   City Blueprint indicator approach and process have been applied as first
   step of gaining a better understanding of IWRM and the challenges ahead.
   This is done by using well-established and high-quality data sets, a
   relatively cost-effective online survey and a relatively simple
   questionnaire. Istanbul has set a good example to the challenges faced
   in water supply in megacities, where illegal settlements on watershed
   zones posed a threat to scarce water resources. Despite these enormous
   efforts, the projected future population growth and climate change in
   Istanbul will necessitate further major transitions towards sustainable
   IWRM. This holds for all aspects of the water cycle: water quality,
   water quantity, water supply and sanitation, coping with extreme weather
   events (floods and droughts), as well as for the protection of the
   sources of water, i.e. ecosystem conservation. Istanbul is a place where
   problems emerge and solutions need to be found. The time window
   available to do this is rapidly closing. As such, this review of IWRM of
   Istanbul confirms the conclusions of the World Economic Forum that water
   supply is one of the top three global risks for both the impact and
   likelihood. Our framework has been applied for nearly 40 cities, and the
   results for Istanbul are discussed in the broader context of recent
   initiatives on water governance and smart cities by the European
   Commission.}},

Abstract = {{The number of applications that need to process data continuously over
   long periods of time has increased significantly over recent years. The
   emerging Internet of Things and Smart Cities scenarios also confirm the
   requirement for real time, large scale data processing. When data from
   multiple sources are processed over a shared distributed computing
   infrastructure, it is necessary to provide some Quality of Service (QoS)
   guarantees for each data stream, specified in a Service Level Agreement
   (SLA). SLAB identify the price that a user must pay to achieve the
   required QoS, and the penalty that the provider will pay the user in
   case of QoS violation. Assuming maximization of revenue as a Cloud
   provider's objective, then it must decide which streams to accept for
   storage and analysis; and how many resources to allocate for each
   stream. When the real-time requirements demand a rapid reaction, dynamic
   resource provisioning policies and mechanisms may not be useful, since
   the delays and overheads incurred might be too high. Alternatively, idle
   resources that were initially allocated for other streams could be
   re-allocated, avoiding subsequent penalties. In this paper, we propose a
   system architecture for supporting QoS for concurrent data streams to be
   composed of self-regulating nodes. Each node features an envelope
   process for regulating and controlling data access and a resource
   manager to enable resource allocation, and selective SLA violations,
   while maximizing revenue. Our resource manager, based on a shared token
   bucket, enables: (i) the redistribution of unused resources amongst data
   streams; and (ii) a dynamic re-allocation of resources to streams likely
   to generate greater profit for the provider. We extend previous work by
   providing a Petri net based model of system components, and we evaluate
   our approach on an OpenNebula-based Cloud infrastructure. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Guwahati, which enjoyed a strategic position throughout history due to
   its geographical location along the mighty Brahmaputra River and its
   defensive topography, has an ancient tradition of urbanisation. The city
   saw its periods of growth and decline from being an important cultural,
   religious, economic and political centre to mere a war site. It was
   rebuilt during the colonial period and within a century, grew from a
   swampy settlement of 12,000 people (1911) into a vast urban
   agglomeration of nearly 1.26 million population (2011). Today, while
   this ancient ``City of Eastern Light{''} has regained its importance as
   an urban centre, intense growth has led to physical, social and
   environmental vulnerabilities regardless of numerous planned efforts
   engaged in city building including adoption of city Master Plans since
   1960s. Despite this, Guwahati has been the focus of little research in
   terms of its morphology depicting both, historic planning paradigms and
   modern urban visioning to reflect the city's ongoing story. Based on
   secondary data, this city profile, narrates the growth and morphological
   evolution of Guwahati from mythology to modern period. It then
   critically examines the city in its present form and concludes that a
   convergence between emergence and planning may be a necessary
   renaissance for Guwahati as it seeks to transform itself into one of the
   most admired, smart and sustainable cities in India. The theoretical
   narration is supported with strong visual atlas which provides an
   empirical strength to this profile. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{With climate warming and the energy crisis growing throughout the world,
   China as a developing country must undergo a revolution in energy
   production and consumption to change the traditional structure and

   China's installed wind power capacity (CWEA) from 2000 to 2014. The
   spatial patterns and influencing factors in China's wind turbine
   manufacturing industry are analyzed, and its features and factors are
   discussed to provide a scientific reference in an ordered pattern.
   Results on spatial patterns are discussed according to the following two
   distinct points. First, China's wind turbine manufacturing has formed a
   relatively complete ``production, marketing, transportation,
   installation, operation and management, maintenance and overhaul{''}
   industrial chain, and enterprises own many bases but display a
   multi-point scattered spatial distribution. However, different parts of
   manufacturing enterprises adopt different exhaustive strategies as shown
   in this research. Overall, national and regional manufacturing centers
   are being formed. Second, China's domestic wind power equipment
   manufacturing enterprises are mainly established through relevant
   equipment manufacturing business investment and are located in the same
   city as their investment companies; meanwhile, foreign enterprises are
   generally located in cities with a solid foundation equipment
   manufacturing industrial base. The subsidiary firms of wind turbine
   manufacturing enterprises are located in Northwest, North, and Northeast
   China, whereas wind farms are generally located in eastern coastal areas
   with abundant wind resources. Furthermore, the influencing factors in
   China's wind turbine manufacturing industry are analyzed as a composite
   issue from several aspects of wind resource endowment, industrial base,
   policy support, and economic and technical support. (1) The industrial
   base primarily affects the choice of location of the wind power
   equipment business parent company. (2) Wind resource endowments mainly
   affect the location selection of subsidiary companies; cities with many
   wind resource areas contain a large number of wind power equipment
   company subsidiaries. (3) Local government support considerably affects
   choice of location of wind power equipment company subsidiaries. (4)
   Among wind resource endowment, industrial base, and local government
   support, the industrial base plays the most important role. Overall, the
   strong support provided by government policy is the foundation, and
   improving the technical level is a necessary condition. The industrial
   base often plays a decisive role. Regional economic openness has a
   significant impact on the spatial patterns of foreign wind power
   manufacturers in the early development of the wind power industry.
   Market and labor capabilities are also vital factors that affect the
   spatial patterns of China's wind turbine manufacturing industry.
   The results of this study provide important information for wind
   equipment manufacturing companies to select new locations and for local
   governments to develop strategic industrial development policies. The
   results also provide a useful reference for foreign firms that intend to
   explore the Chinese wind power market. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Vehicular communication networks represent both an opportunity and a
   challenge for providing smart mobility services by using a hybrid
   solution that relies on cellular connectivity and short range
   communications. The evaluation of this kind of network is overwhelmingly
   carried out in the present literature with simulations. However, the
   degree of realism of the results obtained is limited because simulations
   simplify real world interactions too much in many cases. In this
   article, we define an outdoor testbed to evaluate the performance of
   short range vehicular communications by using real world personal
   portable devices (smartphones, tablets, and laptops), two different PHY
   standards (IEEE 802.11g and IEEE 802.11a), and vehicles. Our test
   results on the 2.4 GHz band show that smartphones can be used to
   communicate vehicles within a range up to 75 m, while tablets can attain
   up to 125 m in mobility conditions. Moreover, we observe that vehicles
   equipped with laptops exchange multimedia information with nodes located
   further than 150 m. The communications on the 5 GHz band achieved an
   effective transmission range of up to 100 m. This, together with the
   optimization of the protocols used, could take our commodity lightweight
   devices to a new realm of use in the next generation of ad hoc mobility
   communications for moving through the city. (C) 2015 Published by

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{1023-1036}},

Abstract = {{Due to the rapidly increasing percentage of the population living in
   urban centres, there is a need to focus on the energy demand of these
   cities and the use of renewable energies instead of fossil fuels. In
   this paper, we develop a spatial model to determine the potential per
   parcel for using shallow geothermal energy, for space heating and hot
   water. The method is based on the space heating and hot water energy
   demand of each building and the specific heat extraction potential of
   the subsurface per parcel. With this information, along with the
   available space per parcel for boreholes, the percentage of the energy
   demand that could be supplied by geothermal energy is calculated. The
   potential reduction in CO2 emissions should all possible geothermal
   energy be utilised, is also calculated. The method is applied to
   Ludwigsburg, Germany. It was found that CO2 emissions could potentially
   be reduced by 29.7\% if all space heating and hot water requirements
   were provided by geothermal energy, which would contribute to the
   sustainability of a city. The method is simple in execution and could be
   applied to other cities as the data used should be readily available.
   Another advantage is the implementation into the web based Smart City
   Energy platform which allows interactive exploration of solutions across
   the city. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A tale of three transitions: a year in the life of electricity system
   transformation narratives in the Irish media}},
Journal = {{ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: This paper focuses on discourses of transition in the
   electricity system in the Irish print media, with particular attention
   to both the framing and the scalar referents of the debate. We
   characterise some of the key contextual drivers for system
   transformation and suggest that too sharp a distinction between existing
   electricity infrastructure and systems of the future forecloses the
   possibility of social learning. Our central question research question
   is: What lessons can emergent techno-optimistic solutions to electricity
   system transitions learn from contemporary infrastructure controversies?
   Using a reconstruction based on print media coverage over a 12-month
   period in Ireland, we present three contrasting short stories to suggest
   that there are some commonalities that might provide cues and clues for
   promoting solutions for transitions to a low-carbon economy and society.
   Methods: We divide our methods section into a discussion of theory and
   methods. In the theory part, we explore the literatures on sustainable
   electricity transitions, critical infrastructures and social
   acceptability of energy solutions. In the methods part, we begin from
   the assertion that storylines help constitute reality allowing
   constellations of actors to coalesce around certain narratives. We
   outline the methodological approach to the reconstruction of mediated
   narratives based on three short stories of electricity system
   transformations in Ireland.
   Results: The three short stories recounted here, the future is smart;
   blurred lines; and policy versus place, show how narratives of economic
   recovery and economic growth risk occlude sustainable electricity system
   transition narratives, generating conflict rather than consensus on the
   decarbonisation of the Irish economy and society.
   Conclusions: Although the public discourse on smart grid technologies is
   very much in its infancy in Ireland, its rhetorical framing is very
   similar to that in both the wind farm and infrastructure controversies.
   The lack of attention to issues of scale, ownership, rhetorical framing
   and the perceived distribution and fairness of costs and benefits in
   these controversies could become equally problematic in the roll of
   smart grid strategies. Smarter green transitions in regions and cities
   do not depend on technological innovation alone but require social and
   institutional innovation to ensure constructive public engagement in
   sustainable electricity system transitions.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Health geographics is a fast-developing research area. Subjects broached
   in scientific literature are most varied, ranging from vectorial
   diseases to access to healthcare, with a recent revival of themes such

   individual-centered approach. Far beyond standard meta-analyses, the
   present study deliberately adopts the standpoint of questioning space in
   its foundations, through various authors of the International Journal of
   Health Geographics, a highly influential journal in that field. The idea
   is to find space as the common denominator in this specialized
   literature, as well as its relation to spatial analysis, without for all
   that trying to tend towards exhaustive approaches. 660 articles have
   being published in the journal since launch, but 359 articles were
   selected based on the presence of the word ``Space{''} in either the
   title, or the abstract or the text over 13 years of the journal's
   existence. From that database, a lexical analysis (tag cloud) reveals
   the perception of space in literature, and shows how approaches are
   evolving, thus underlining that the scope of health geographics is far
   from narrowing.}},

Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{4273-4282}},

Abstract = {{Complexity science has become prominent in studying cities as concepts
   like ``smart city{''} and ``big data{''} indicate. In particular network
   analysis has allowed to studying various aspects of cities in new ways.
   As such these analyses are often disconnected and subsequent business
   models often remain disembedded. However, complexity science can also
   compare various patterns extending over different scales (scaling) if
   they belong to the same entity (allometry). Such relationships pertain
   to cities too suggesting that buildings, infrastructure and traffic
   amongst other things develop interdependently and, that across specific
   city systems scaling phenomena can be compared according to cities'
   population size. The article argues that while many scaling phenomena of
   physical and social networks can indeed inform urban transition research
   the proposed central role of cities' population size is highly
   ambivalent. This is particularly true for economic indicators like GDP,
   which do not reflect the need for sustainability. Still, network and
   scaling analysis of the built environment can contribute to transition
   theory if explanatory social mechanisms relating human behaviours and
   social institutions to existing scaling phenomena are provided. (C) 2015

Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{494-503}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In the contest of European and National choices regarding energy and
   mobility policies, the goal of this paper is to introduce reasonable
   guidelines for the local promotion of electric mobility in an area of
   central Italy and possibly to extend the methodology to other
   regions/countries. In fact, the path towards car electrification is
   started worldwide, but the rate of increase of electrically powered cars
   will depend primarily on charging stations availability. In this
   respect, utilities that manage/own local grids may be key actors by
   investing on infrastructures and thus locally creating the conditions
   for the spreading of electric cars. A techno-economic analysis of the
   investment of a local utility has been performed taking into account
   medium- and long term-forecasts of electricity and fuel prices, as well
   as electric cars market share and economic risk. The study proved that
   an investment in urban charging station infrastructure in Italy can be
   profitable even without incentives, with a payback period of 4-5 years.
   The results of the analysis have been exploited by an Italian utility
   which owns/manages the local electric grid in two municipalities. The
   first steps of the plan implementation, which started in 2014, are
   reported in the paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   bedroom and a most used room) in nine participating homes over a 7-day
   period with subsequent computation of a range of noise metrics. The SLMs
   and dosimeters yielded similar A-weighted average noise levels. Levels
   measured by the smart devices often differed substantially (showing both
   positive and negative bias, depending on the metric) from those measured
   via SLM and dosimeter, and demonstrated attenuation in some frequency
   bands in spectral analysis compared to SLM results. Virtually all
   measurements exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency's 45 dBA-day
   night limit for indoor residential exposures. The measurement protocol
   developed here can be employed in homes, demonstrates the possibility of
   measuring long-term noise exposures in homes with technologies beyond
   traditional SLMs, and highlights potential pitfalls associated with
   measurements made by smart devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Water network partitioning (WNP) concerns the implementation of the
   paradigm of `divide and conquer' in the water supply systems consisting
   in dividing a water network into k smaller subsystems by gate valves and
   flow meters. WNP allows improving the management of water distribution
   systems by transforming into Smart WAter Networks (SWANs) that represent
   key subsystems of Smart Cities. WNP is possible if water utilities start
   to use isolating valves (also with control devices) and flow meters.
   These instruments open new perspectives for the management of water
   supply systems both in terms of water saving and water protection.
   Recently, starting from the advantages offered by computing power and
   network analysis tools, some techniques based on graph partitioning
   algorithms have been developed by the authors to improve water
   management and protection, implementing the paradigm of `divide and
   conquer'. This paper presents the second release of SWANP 2.0 (Smart
   WAter Network Partitioning and Protection) software that integrates two
   different algorithms, based on multilevel and multi-agent techniques,
   for WNP and a novel algorithm, based on a multi-objective function, for
   water network protection from intentional contamination. The SWANP 2.0
   software, developed in Python v2.7.6 language, provides the
   decision-maker different solutions comparing network layouts with some
   hydraulic and protection performance indices.}},

Abstract = {{After the Fukushima nuclear accident, attention has been paid toward the
   construction and maintenance of nuclear power plants. A nuclear material
   spill originating from cracks in the nuclear plant's concrete structure
   due to natural disasters such as earthquakes or inappropriate planning
   and construction will have harmful consequences. There are ongoing
   studies for developing technologies to predict cracking in a structure
   when said structure is harmed by unexpected damages. This paper deals
   with studies on a ubiquitous crack detection and analysis system that is
   a combination of the extended finite element method (X-FEM) and
   ubiquitous sensor network (USN) technologies and can respond quickly
   when a nuclear plant is damaged. Because X-FEM is a considerably
   developed analysis technology, its use allows for relatively accurate
   crack analysis. Thus, the combined ability of real-time damage reporting
   using USN and data-based estimation of the scale of damage through crack
   analysis is expected to be useful for reducing damages due to
   unpredicted calamities.}},

Title = {{MiraMap: A We-Government Tool for Smart Peripheries in Smart Cities}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{3824-3843}},
Abstract = {{Increasingly over the last decade, there has been attention and
   expectations on the role that Information and Communication Technology
   (ICT) solutions can play in increasing accountability, participation,
   and transparency in the public administration. In addition, attention to
   citizen participation is more and more at the center of the debate about
   smart cities. However, technological solutions have been often proposed
   without considering the first citizen's needs and the sociotechnical
   misalignment within the city, i.e., in peripheral area. This paper
   outlines the design and implementation process of a we-government IT
   tool, called MiraMap. The project has been developed in the Mirafiori
   District in Torino (Italy), a neighborhood, which is characterized by
   the problems of marginality and by several undergoing urban
   transformations with a very high potential for social and economic
   development in the next few years. This makes Mirafiori Sud a valuable
   case study environment to experiment new methods and IT solutions to
   strengthen the connection between citizens and public administration.
   The object of MiraMap, indeed, is to facilitate communication and
   management between citizens and administration in reporting of issues
   and claims but also in submitting proposals. Collecting and handling of
   this information in an efficient way are crucial to improve the quality
   of life in urban suburbs, addressing more targeted and better performed
   public policies. In order to achieve those results, we combined First
   Life, a new local social network based on an interactive map, with a
   business process management system for easing reports about claims and
   proposals to be handled. The research process involves an
   interdisciplinary team, composed by architects, computer scientists,
   engineers, geographers, and legal experts, with the direct participation
   of local administrators and citizens.}},

Title = {{Trust Management for Vehicular Networks : An Adversary-Oriented Overview}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems, mainly represented by
   vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), are among the key components
   contributing to the Smart City and Smart World paradigms. Based on the
   continuous exchange of both periodic and event triggered messages, smart
   vehicles can enhance road safety, while also providing support for
   comfort applications. In addition to the different communication
   protocols, securing such communications and establishing a certain
   trustiness among vehicles are among the main challenges to address,
   since the presence of dishonest peers can lead to unwanted situations.
   To this end, existing security solutions are typically divided into two
   main categories, cryptography and trust, where trust appeared as a
   complement to cryptography on some specific adversary models and
   environments where the latter was not enough to mitigate all possible
   attacks. In this paper, we provide an adversary-oriented survey of the
   existing trust models for VANETs. We also show when trust is preferable
   to cryptography, and the opposite. In addition, we show how trust models
   are usually evaluated in VANET contexts, and finally, we point out some
   critical scenarios that existing trust models cannot handle, together
   with some possible solutions.}},

Journal = {{URBAN GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{535-553}},
Abstract = {{Smart city initiatives have been adopted by cities worldwide, proposing
   forward-looking, technological solutions to urban problems big and
   small. These policies are indicative of a digitized urban condition,
   where social and economic exchange rely on globalized telecommunications
   networks, and governance strategies follow suit. Propelled through
   events such as IBM's Smarter Cities Challenge, the smart city acts as a
   data-driven logic urban change where widespread benefit to a city and
   its residents is proposed, masking the utility of these policies to
   further entrepreneurial economic development strategies. In this
   article, I present a case study of the Digital On-Ramps initiative that
   emerged from IBM's policy-consultation in Philadelphia. The initiative
   proposed a social media-style workforce education application (app) to
   train up to 500,000 low-literacy residents for jobs in the information
   and knowledge economy, but even as the city's mayor declared the project
   a success, it did not meet expectations. This essay argues that the
   rhetoric of intelligent, transformative digital change works much more
   to ``sell{''} a city in the global economy than to actually address
   urban inequalities.}},

Pages = {{78-89}},
Abstract = {{Bicycle transportation increasingly has become a central focus of urban
   regions invested in the improvement of livability, sustainability, and
   public health outcomes. Recently, transportation agencies across North
   America have deployed travel surveys with a smartphone application to
   gain a better understanding of bicycling travel behavior to forecast
   travel, to invest in infrastructure, and for a variety of other
   purposes. A potential limitation of data sets crowdsourced with
   smartphones is sampling bias (i.e., the demographic characteristics of
   the smart phone application users may not match the characteristics of
   the cycling population). Such a bias can be caused by the passive nature
   of sample recruitment, by differences in access to smartphone ownership
   or in familiarity with the technology, or both. This study examined the
   characteristics of several user samples from bicycle smartphone
   application deployments in North America. Differences between these
   samples were highlighted, and the smartphone samples were compared with
   cycling samples from travel survey data sets. Whenever possible, a
   statistical test was used to calculate the statistical significance of
   the differences between smartphone samples and traditional travel survey
   samples. Compared with travel surveys, smartphone applications tended to
   undersample females, older adults, and lower-income populations and to
   oversample some minority ethnicity populations. The analysis also
   revealed that, for cities in which travel survey sample sizes were
   small, smartphone applications could provide higher-resolution data and
   larger sample sizes of bicyclists. For transportation agencies, all of
   these findings are useful to plan future travel survey and sample
   recruitment efforts.}},

   Silicon Photonics Switches}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{8236-8249}},
Abstract = {{Today's best-effort (BE) Internet of Things (IoT) faces challenges in
   providing the end-to-end-performance, security, and energy efficiency
   needed for the Smart Systems of the 21st century. These future smart
   systems will include smart cities, smart transportation systems, and
   smart manufacturing. This paper surveys the security weaknesses of the
   BE IoT. The BE-IoT cannot be partitioned into distinct interference-free
   virtual networks, which compromises performance, cyber-security, and
   energy efficiency. The design of a secure deterministic
   industrial-tactile IoT core network, which can embed millions of
   distinct secure deterministic virtual networks (SD-VNs) in layer 2, is
   then presented. Deterministic communications, combined with low-jitter
   scheduling, offers several benefits: 1) the removal of all congestion,
   interference, and DOS attacks; 2) a significant reduction in IoT router
   buffer sizes; 3) a significant reduction in IoT energy use; 4) a
   reduction of end-to-end IoT delays to the speed of light in fiber; and
   5) deterministic packet switches are relatively easy to synthesize using
   FPGA technologies. These benefits apply to optical and 5G wireless
   networks. Future smart systems can reserve their own congestion-free
   SD-VNs in layer 2 to manage their traffic, with significantly improved
   performance, security, and energy efficiency. A speed-of-light
   deterministic IoT core network can transform cloud services in the 21st
   century by exploiting a new technology: FPGAs combined with silicon
   photonics transceivers to achieve terabits/second of optical bandwidth.
   To illustrate the transformational potential, Big Data green cloud
   computing over a secure deterministic IoT spanning the European Union is
   explored.}},

Title = {{Use of Mobile Ticketing Data to Estimate an Origin-Destination Matrix
   for New York City Ferry Service}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2544}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Abstract = {{One of the fundamental components of transit planning is understanding
   passenger demand, which is commonly represented with origin destination
   (O-D) matrices. However, manual collection of detailed O-D information
   through surveys can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, data from
   automated fare collection systems, such as smart cards, often include
   only entry information without tracking where passengers exit the
   transit network. New mobile ticketing systems offer the opportunity to
   prompt riders about their specific trips when they purchase a ticket,
   and this information can be used to track O-D patterns during the ticket
   activation phase. Therefore, the objective of this research is to use
   back-end mobile ticketing data to generate passenger O-D matrices and
   compare the outcome with O-D matrices generated with traditional onboard
   surveys. Iterative proportional fitting was used to create O-D matrices
   with both mobile ticketing and onboard survey data. These matrices were
   compared using Euclidean distance calculations. This work was done for
   the East River Ferry in New York City, and the results show that during
   peak periods, mobile ticketing data closely match survey data. However,
   in the off-peak period and during weekends, when travelers are more
   likely to be noncommuters and tourists, matrices developed from mobile
   ticketing and survey data have greater differences. The impact of
   occasional riders making noncommute trips is the likely cause for these
   differences, because commuters are familiar with using the mobile
   ticketing product and occasional riders are more likely to use paper
   tickets on the ferry service.}},

Title = {{Survey of Promising Technologies for 5G Networks}},
Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{As an enhancement of cellular networks, the future-generation 5G network
   can be considered an ultra-high-speed technology. The proposed 5G
   network might include all types of advanced dominant technologies to
   provide remarkable services. Consequently, new architectures and service
   management schemes for different applications of the emerging
   technologies need to be recommended to solve issues related to data
   traffic capacity, high data rate, and reliability for ensuring QoS.
   Cloud computing, Internet of things (IoT), and software-defined
   networking (SDN) have become some of the core technologies for the 5G
   network. Cloud-based services provide flexible and efficient solutions
   for information and communications technology by reducing the cost of
   investing in and managing information technology infrastructure. In
   terms of functionality, SDN is a promising architecture that decouples
   control planes and data planes to support programmability, adaptability,
   and flexibility in ever-changing network architectures. However, IoT
   combines cloud computing and SDN to achieve greater productivity for
   evolving technologies in 5G by facilitating interaction between the
   physical and human world. The major objective of this study provides a
   lawless vision on comprehensive works related to enabling technologies

Title = {{Emerging research topics in control for smart infrastructures}},
Journal = {{ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{259-270}},
Abstract = {{As we move deeper into the 21st century, critical infrastructures
   related to energy and transportation are becoming smart-monitor
   themselves, communicate, and most importantly self-govern. Various
   drivers have enabled this transition, including sustainability concerns,
   scarcity in resources, economic considerations, and rapid growth in
   enabling technologies of sensor networks, and computational and
   communication systems. Two notable examples of such infrastructures are
   smart grids and smart cities. The idea behind a Smart grid is the
   creation of a dynamic, cyber-physical infrastructure that meets the
   challenges of intermittency and distributed availability of renewables,
   and realizes reduced operational costs and emissions, via a flexible,
   intelligent, and networked grid that plans, controls, and balances
   supply and demand over an entire region. The concept of a Smart City is
   gaining popular attention driven by goals of sustainability and
   efficiency, the needs of enhancing quality of life and affordability,
   growing urbanization of the world's population, and the explosion of
   technological advances in communication and computation. While systems
   and control problems abound in any complex dynamic system, two
   characteristics that are specific to critical infrastructures are the
   need to deliver reliable service and the ability to accomplish this goal
   amidst constrained resources. These in turn lead to new research topics
   in systems and control including empowered consumers, transactive
   control, and resilience. The focus of this paper is on these emerging
   topics. Their role in smart infrastructures, the opportunities they
   provide, and the research challenges that they bring in are all
   discussed. Specific illustrations of recent successes are presented that
   are based on coordinated adjustment of generation and consumption using
   concepts of multi-agents and multi-timescales in smart grids and
   socio-technical models of empowered drivers in smart cities. (C) 2016

Title = {{A Safety Resource Allocation Mechanism against Connection Fault for
   Vehicular Cloud Computing}},
Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{The Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) becomes an important
   component of the smart city toward safer roads, better traffic control,
   and on-demand service by utilizing and processing the information
   collected from sensors of vehicles and road side infrastructure. In ITS,
   Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) is a novel technology balancing the
   requirement of complex services and the limited capability of on-board
   computers. However, the behaviors of the vehicles in VCC are dynamic,
   random, and complex. Thus, one of the key safety issues is the frequent
   disconnections between the vehicle and the VehicularCloud (VC) when this
   vehicle is computing for a service. More important, the connection fault
   will disturb seriously the normal services of VCC and impact the
   safetyworks of the transportation. In this paper, a safety resource
   allocation mechanism is proposed against connection fault in VCC by
   using a modified workflow with prediction capability. We firstly propose
   the probability model for the vehicle movement which satisfies the high
   dynamics and real-time requirements of VCC. And then we propose a
   Prediction-based Reliability Maximization Algorithm (PRMA) to realize
   the safety resource allocation for VCC. The evaluation shows that our
   mechanism can improve the reliability and guarantee the real-time
   performance of the VCC.}},

Pages = {{120-130}},
Abstract = {{Automated computer vision video analysis techniques were used to analyze
   video data during the operation of New York City's Summer Streets
   Program at a major signalized intersection. The main objectives of this
   study were to diagnose pedestrian and cyclist safety issues during the
   shared space operation and to demonstrate the feasibility of the
   automatic extraction of road user data (e.g., pedestrian, runner,
   rollerblader, or cyclist) required for microscopic behavior analysis.
   Road users' speeds and pedestrian gait parameters (step frequency and
   step length) were automatically extracted and analyzed. Results show
   that pedestrian walking speed was highest during the Summer Streets
   operation (1.49 +/- 0.54 m/s) because pedestrians had more street space
   to use and slowest during normal operations (1.30 +/- 0.22 m/s). Bike
   speeds were low during the Summer Streets event (3.62 +/- 0.97 m/s),
   likely because of interaction with pedestrians, but these speeds
   increased during normal traffic operations. Pedestrians and cyclists
   moving in groups tended to be slower and confirmed results found in
   previous studies. The safety analysis was conducted with traffic
   conflict techniques. It was observed that the lowest rate of conflicts
   between pedestrians and cyclists and between cyclists was found to be
   during Summer Streets operations. In addition, an analysis of spatial
   violations showed that some road users were not observing traffic rules
   in the transition period after Summer Streets ceased to operate.}},

Title = {{Social-Aware Data Collection Scheme Through Opportunistic Communication
   in Vehicular Mobile Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{6480-6502}},
Abstract = {{To enable the intelligent management of Smart City and improve overall
   social welfare, it is desirable for the status of infrastructures
   detected and reported by intelligent devices embedded in them to be
   forwarded to the data centers. Using ``SCmules{''} such as taxis, to
   opportunistically communicate with intelligent devices and collect data
   from the sparse networks formed by them in the process of moving is an
   economical and effective way to achieve this goal. In this paper, the
   social welfare data collection paradigm SWDCP-SCmules data collection
   framework is proposed to collect data generated by intelligent devices
   and forward them to data centers, in which ``SCmules{''} are data
   transmitters picking up data from nearby intelligent devices and then
   store-carry-forwarding them to nearby data centers via short-range
   wireless connections in the process of moving. Because of the storage
   limitations, ``SCmules{''} need to weigh the value of data and select
   some less valuable data to discard when necessary. To quantify the value
   of data and find a well-performed selection strategy, the concept of
   priority is introduced to the SWDCP-SCmules scheme, and then, the
   simulated annealing for priority assignment SA-PA algorithm is proposed
   to guide the priority assignment. The SA-PA algorithm is a universal
   algorithm that can improve the performance of SWDCP-SCmules scheme by
   finding better priority assignment with respect to various optimization
   targets, such as maximizing collection rate or minimizing redundancy
   rate, in which priority assignment problem is converted into an
   optimization problem and simulated annealing is used to optimize the
   priority assignment. From the perspective of machine learning, the
   process of optimization is equal to automatically learn social aware
   patterns from past GPS trajectory data. Experiments based on real GPS
   trajectory data of taxis in Beijing are conducted to show the
   effectiveness and efficiency of SWDCP-SCmules scheme and SA-PA
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing popularity of mobile route planning applications based on GPS
   technology provides opportunities for collecting traffic data in urban
   environments. One of the main challenges for travel time estimation and
   prediction in such a setting is how to aggregate data from vehicles that
   have followed different routes, and predict travel time for new routes
   of interest. One approach is to predict travel times for route segments,
   and sum those estimates to obtain a prediction for the whole route. We
   study how to obtain optimal predictions in this scenario. It appears
   that the optimal way to estimate travel times to minimize the expected
   mean absolute error is to combine the mean and the median times on
   individual segments, where the combination function depends on the
   number of segments in the route of interest. We present a methodology
   for obtaining such estimates, and demonstrate its performance on a case
   study using travel time data from a district of St. Petersburg collected
   over one year. The proposed methodology is meant for real-time
   prediction of expected travel times in an urban road network.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution centers, link supply chain to the customers. Layout of the
   distribution centers is very important in terms of product conservation
   at the required service level and delivering of products with minimum
   cost to the customer from distribution centers. Therefore, the layout
   design of distribution centers should be handled with a smart decision
   system. In this study, the layout design of a fruits and vegetable hall,
   which is a kind of urban distribution center, is investigated for two
   different scenarios: (1) assignments of the brokers to the stores and
   (2) assignments of the products to the stores. The study suggests the
   most suitable allocation models for the inner layout of distribution
   center. In the first phase, the requirements of the mathematical model
   to develop the decision making system for the layouts of distribution
   center that will be determined. In the second phase, allocation models
   will be developed and solved for fruits and vegetables halls in
   Istanbul.}},

Abstract = {{In many smart city' applications, congestion arises in part due to the
   nature of signals received by individuals from a central authority. In
   the model of Mareek et al., each agent uses one out of multiple
   resources at each time instant. The per-use cost of a resource depends
   on the number of concurrent users. A central authority has up-to-date
   knowledge of the congestion across all resources and uses randomisation
   to provide a scalar or an interval for each resource at each time. In
   this paper, the interval to broadcast per resource is obtained by taking
   the minima and maxima of costs observed within a time window of length
   r, rather than by randomisation. We show that the resulting distribution
   of agents across resources also converges in distribution, under
   plausible assumptions about the evolution of the population over time.}},

Journal = {{ANNALI DELL ISTITUTO SUPERIORE DI SANITA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{104-113}},
Abstract = {{Introduction. We investigated emerging trends in consuming behaviours
   for non-controlled substances in a cross sectional study on urban
   Italian adolescents and young adults, the reasons for consumption and
   risk perception as function of age, the relation with lifestyles and
   finally risk factors associated.
   Methods. The survey methodology involved the administration of an
   anonymous questionnaire. It consisted of 68 questions, divided into five
   sections: personal details, socioeconomic characteristics, family and
   peer group, free time and lifestyles, and substances use.
   Results. A total of 2621 adolescents and young adults (14-35 years old)
   from seven different Italian cities answered the questionnaire. The
   substances examined were mainly used recreationally (alcohol, energy
   drinks and smart-drugs) or to improve physical and sexual performance
   (physical performance-enhancing drugs, anabolic steroids and male sexual
   enhancement). The knowledge of the health related harm arising from the
   use of these products was very high for alcohol (> 90\%), high for
   smart-drugs (> 70\%), but significantly lower for anabolic steroids,
   drugs for sexual enhancement (similar to 60\%), physical
   performance-enhancing drugs or energy drinks (similar to 55\%). The
   principal risks factors for consumption were: the influence of friends
   (OR: 8.8), attending recreational places (OR: 5.4) aged between 25-35
   years (OR: 3.0), be male (OR: 2.5) and having a bad relationship with
   the mother (OR: 2.1).
   Conclusions. These results have implication for prevention and early
   intervention programs of ``physically and psychologically enhancing{''}
   non controlled substances use, which similarly to what is frequently
   advised for classical illicit drugs should focus on information
   campaigns and awareness initiatives especially addressed to young male
   adults who go clubbing, live outside the family and showed closed links
   with peers.}},

Abstract = {{This discussion paper aims to set out the key challenges and
   opportunities emerging from distributed manufacturing (DM). We begin by
   describing the concept, available definitions and consider its evolution
   where recent production technology developments (such as additive and
   continuous production process technologies), digitisation together with
   infrastructural developments (in terms of IoT and big data) provide new
   opportunities. To further explore the evolving nature of DM, the
   authors, each of whom are involved in specific applications of DM
   research, examine through an expert panel workshop environment emerging
   DM applications involving new production and supporting infrastructural
   technologies. This paper presents these generalisable findings on DM
   challenges and opportunities in terms of products, enabling production
   technologies and the impact on the wider production and industrial
   system. Industry structure and location of activities are examined in
   terms of the democratising impact on participating network actors. The
   paper concludes with a discussion on the changing nature of
   manufacturing as a result of DM, from the traditional centralised,
   large-scale, long lead-time forecast-driven production operations to a
   new DM paradigm where manufacturing is a decentralised, autonomous near
   end user-driven activity. A forward research agenda is proposed that
   considers the impact of DM on the industrial and urban landscape.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{23, SI}},
Pages = {{7181-7192}},
Abstract = {{This paper is a first step to understand the role that a smart city with
   a distributed production system could have in changing the nature and
   form of supply chain design. Since the end of the Second World War, most
   supply chain systems for manufactured products have been based on scale
   economies' and bigness'; in our paper we challenge this traditional
   view. Our fundamental research question is: how could a smart city
   production system change supply chain design? In answering this
   question, we develop an integrative framework for understanding the
   interplay between smart city technological initiatives (big data
   analytics, the industrial Internet of things) and distributed
   manufacturing on supply chain design. This framework illustrates
   synergies between manufacturing and integrative technologies within the
   smart city context and links with supply chain design. Considering that
   smart cities are based on the collaboration between firms, end-users and
   local stakeholders, we advance the present knowledge on production
   systems through case-study findings at the product level. In the
   conclusion, we stress there is a need for future research to empirically
   develop our work further and measure (beyond the product level) the
   extent to which new production technologies such as distributed
   manufacturing are indeed democratising supply chain design and
   transforming manufacturing from global production' to a future
   city-oriented' social materiality.}},

Title = {{A Service-Oriented Approach to Crowdsensing for Accessible Smart
   Mobility Scenarios}},
Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{This work presents an architecture to help designing and deploying smart
   mobility applications. The proposed solution builds on the experience
   already matured by the authors in different fields: crowdsourcing and
   sensing done by users to gather data related to urban barriers and
   facilities, computation of personalized paths for users with special
   needs, and integration of open data provided by bus companies to
   identify the actual accessibility features and estimate the real arrival
   time of vehicles at stops. In terms of functionality, the first
   ``monolithic{''} prototype fulfilled the goal of composing the
   aforementioned pieces of information to support citizens with reduced
   mobility (users with disabilities and/or elderly people) in their urban
   movements. In this paper, we describe a service-oriented architecture
   that exploits the microservices orchestration paradigm to enable the
   creation of new services and to make the management of the various data
   sources easier and more effective. The proposed platform exposes
   standardized interfaces to access data, implements common services to
   manage metadata associated with them, such as trustworthiness and
   provenance, and provides an orchestration language to create complex
   services, naturally mapping their internal workflow to code. The
   manuscript demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach by means of
   some case studies.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},

Pages = {{2036-2056}},
Abstract = {{In polycentric urban regions several distinct cities, none of which is
   dominant, cooperate and compete with each other to attract inhabitants
   and firms. In such settings city branding strategies do not solely
   affect one city, but the entire region. We examined how city branding in
   the face of ecological modernization, that is, delivering higher added
   economic value, while lowering environmental impacts, is playing out in
   the Dutch Randstad and the German Rhine-Ruhr. Our findings show that
   regional identity formation occurs at the sub-polycentric urban region
   level, coinciding more with (historical) economic profiles than with
   planning imaginaries. The Dutch cities profile themselves more along the
   lines of ecological modernization than their German counterparts.
   Differences between subregions within each polycentric urban region are
   also noticeable, where more industrialized regions, such as the Ruhr or
   southern Randstad focus on green', liveable' and knowledge-oriented',
   while cities with stronger knowledge-intensive sectors portray
   themselves as smart' or sustainable'. Cities generally substantiate
   their profiles through projects, but a significant gap persists between
   reality and aspirations for improved environmental conditions. This is
   especially true for the Dutch cities, where many claims, but little
   visible action can be observed.}},

Title = {{Direction Estimation for Pedestrian Monitoring System in Smart Cities:
   An HMM Based Approach}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{5788-5808}},
Abstract = {{The paper proposes a novel approach for direction estimation of a moving
   pedestrian as perceived in a 2-D coordinate of field camera. The
   proposed direction estimation method is intended for pedestrian
   monitoring in traffic control systems. Apart from traffic control,
   direction of motion estimation is also very important in accident
   avoidance system for smart cars, assisted living systems, in occlusion
   prediction for seamless tracking in visual surveillance, and so on. The
   proposed video-based direction estimation method exploits the notion of
   perspective distortion as perceived in monocular vision of 2-D camera
   co-ordinate. The temporal pattern of change in dimension of pedestrian
   in a frame sequence is unique for each direction; hence, the dimensional
   change-based feature is used to estimate the direction of motion; eight
   discrete directions of motion are considered and the hidden Markov model
   is used for classification. The experiments are conducted over CASIA
   Dataset A, CASIA Dataset B, and over a self acquired dataset: NITR
   Conscious Walk Dataset. The balanced accuracy of direction estimation
   for these experiments yields satisfactory results with accuracy indices
   as 94.58\%, 90.87\%, and 95.83\%, respectively. The experiment also
   justifies with suitable test conditions about the characteristic
   features, such as robustness toward improper segmentation, partial
   occlusion, and changing orientation of head or body during walk of a
   pedestrian. The proposed method can be used as a standalone system or
   can be integrated with existing frame-based direction estimation methods
   for implementing a pedestrian monitoring system.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we connect two notions of accessibility that are more
   often than not considered separately: pedestrian accessibility and
   transit accessibility. We move away from the notion of zonal
   accessibility and measure fine-grained accessibility using door-to-door
   travel times. Two pedestrian networks are compared to a baseline
   scenario considering Euclidean distances for a large metropolitan area
   in which each individual building is considered as an activity
   opportunity. It is shown that pedestrian accessibility to jobs differs
   when pedestrian distances are approximated with different networks that
   are more representative of reality. Stop-to-stop public transport travel
   times are extracted from an agent-based simulation of public transport
   smart card data. The effect of less-than-optimal connections from
   transit to the pedestrian network, a local measurement, can be seen when
   calculating the accessibility to all destinations in the city. We
   suggest moving away from Euclidean-based distance analyses. Limitations
   can be found in the data available; the connection of buildings to the
   network becomes important, as does the inclusion of pedestrian
   crossings. For an inclusive accessibility measure, it will be necessary
   to calculate generalized costs for pedestrians and generate different
   pedestrian networks that reflect the limitations of different user
   groups.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses a novel spatial approach to compare population density
   change across cities and over time. It examines spatio-temporal change
   in Australia's five most populated capital cities from 1981 to 2011, and
   documents the established and emerging patterns of population
   distribution. The settlement patterns of Australian cities have changed
   substantially in the last 30 years. From the doughnut cities of the
   1980s, programs of consolidation, renewal and densification have changed
   and concentrated population in our cities. Australian cities in the
   1980s were characterised by sparsely populated, low density centres with
   growth concentrated to the suburban fringes. Smart Growth' and the New
   Urbanism' movements in the 1990s advocated higher dwelling density
   living and the inner cities re-emerged, inner areas were redeveloped,
   and the population distribution shifted towards increased inner city
   population densities. Policies aimed at re-populating the inner city
   dominated and the resultant changes are now visible in Australia's five
   most populated capital cities. While this pattern has been reported in a
   number of studies, questions remain regarding the extent of these
   changes and how to analyse and visualise them across urban space. This
   paper reports on a spatial method which addresses the limitations of
   changing statistical boundaries to identify the changing patterns in
   Australian cities over time and space.}},

Abstract = {{Water management in a country like Germany is an essential service of

   develop strategies for improve it. Also, it was made an analysis of how

   management policy of any institution in a city is closely related to
   that city waste management strategy. After analysing the present
   situation and addressing the key questions in the Oradea smart city
   strategy, it has been concluded that the University has to act to
   prevent generating waste and acting to re-use waste according to the
   most intelligent collection system of Oradea. With the cost of new
   technologies steadily decreasing, and plenty of wireless technologies
   available to make smart waste possible, University of Oradea can

Title = {{Social Media Meets Big Urban Data: A Case Study of Urban Waterlogging
   Analysis}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{With the design and development of smart cities, opportunities as well
   as challenges arise at the moment. For this purpose, lots of data need
   to be obtained. Nevertheless, circumstances vary in different cities due
   to the variant infrastructures and populations, which leads to the data
   sparsity. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning method for urban
   waterlogging disaster analysis, which provides the basis for traffic
   management agencies to generate proactive traffic operation strategies
   in order to alleviate congestion. Existing work on urban waterlogging
   mostly relies on past and current conditions, as well as sensors and
   cameras, while there may not be a sufficient number of sensors to cover
   the relevant areas of a city. To this end, it would be helpful if we
   could transfer waterlogging. We examine whether it is possible to use
   the copious amounts of information from social media and satellite data
   to improve urban waterlogging analysis. Moreover, we analyze the
   correlation between severity, road networks, terrain, and precipitation.
   Moreover, we use a multiview discriminant transfer learning method to
   transfer knowledge to small cities. Experimental results involving
   cities in China and India show that our proposed framework is effective.}},

Abstract = {{There has been a growing concentration of high-achieving students
   attending selective public schools of choice as part of the neoliberal
   reforms of education. While this growth has had an eroding effect on the
   aim of inclusivity in public education, few have explored this
   development as a new segment of elite schooling. This paper fills this
   gap by drawing from an ethnographic study of school choice that focused
   on the phenomenology of students (ages 11-19) in the context of
   Vancouver, a major Canadian city. I argue that the practice of a select
   group of young learners choosing competitive public schools of choice
   contributes to our collective imagination and identification of these
   learners as distinctively smart and gifted. While building on Bourdieu's
   classic theory of cultural, economic, and social capital to analyse this
   phenomenon as a form of elite schooling, I highlight the importance of
   the neoliberal imaginary in how select youths come to embody the status
   of elites through the processes of competition, choice, and mobility.}},

Abstract = {{Social science research on the relationship between space and sex work,
   specifically among women in street-based settings, demonstrates the
   spatialized nature of risk and how different forms of civic and legal
   governance contribute to their socio-economic marginalization. However,
   these studies rarely consider the women's spatial practices and gendered
   subjectivities beyond the sex trade, which is problematic because sex
   work is not their singular life activity or the only impetus for their
   spatial movements through the urban landscape. Using social mapping and
   interview data from 33 women in sex work in London, Ontario, this
   article explores how our participants navigate the spaces where they
   work and live alongside those regarding health care, social services,
   violence and places they avoid. Findings reveal that the women traverse
   diverse spaces as they access health services, especially for crisis
   issues that necessitate travel to hospitals located beyond the inner
   city. The spaces used to access social services and those they avoid
   (i.e. to not be emotionally triggered or under police surveillance)
   overlap significantly, which presents unique challenges for our
   participants who depend upon these services for their socio-economic
   survival. The theoretical contributions these data make to the feminist
   geography literature on gender and space are discussed, particularly
   with respect to the issues of nomadic subjectivity and the relationality
   between city spaces and marginalized bodies.}},

Abstract = {{The current widespread attention on the concept of smart city in both
   policy and practice has stimulated academic discussion regarding the
   scope and applicability of this concept. An important question is
   whether cities and regions are truly advanced in implementing the
   concept in their policies and practices relative to its conceptual
   elaborations in academia. The aim of this paper is to analyse this
   congruence between theory and practice in the context of the ongoing
   transformations of railway station areas in European urban regions.
   Based on in-depth interviewing using aspects of Q-methodology, this
   paper investigates whether and how smart city concepts are implemented
   by stakeholders in three station redevelopment projects in the
   Netherlands. The results show that the current implementation of smart
   city concepts in practice is varied but modest and not (yet) very
   advanced. Knowledge exchange and innovations are currently hampered by a
   lack of acceptance and know-how among stakeholders, as well as by
   institutional and competitive constraints. For instance, stakeholders
   stress that data privacy regulations should be well organized before
   further implementation can occur. Transparency about how and what data
   are used may create more willingness among users to assist in developing
   and accepting new data technologies. However, the technologies are not
   yet completely developed, and concerns about the ``loss{''} of personal
   privacy are holding back the widespread and advanced use of data
   supplied technologies. Although stakeholders seem to be aware of the
   opportunities the smart city concept offers, for now, the widespread
   implementation of innovative and advanced smart city concepts remains in
   the future.}},

Abstract = {{This essay proposes that the rise of sentient cities inaugurates an era
   of pervasive citizenship wherein individual citizens function as

   practices are available in this problematic, the essay proceeds in three
   parts. First, it surveys how information systems help determine rhetoric
   through and as a kind of systems theory. Second, the essay traces how
   technologies and techniques that form individual bodies are now emerging
   at larger scales and shape collective bodies. Through several examples,
   the essay shows how these multipartner ventures to install data
   collection sensors in cities are informing a new problematic that we
   term \#SenseCommons. Third, the project offers extradisciplinary
   resources for rhetorically navigating today's increasingly pervasive
   information spaces. Ultimately, this essay proposes that the emergence
   of sentient cities introduces a system of continuous rhetoric whose
   primary function is not to persuade but to inform.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, user experience design (UXD) of a prototype kiosk for the
   stanbul Public Transportation System (PTS) was presented. The kiosk
   included the following modules: a guide for tourists and newcomers,
   route finder, stanbulkart operations (the smart city card for
   transportation), purchasing tickets-tokens, and a coin machine. The
   methodology consisted of a user survey, persona and scenario generation,
   design heuristics, system architecture, and user experience testing. The
   survey conducted with 168 participants revealed the following key
   points: Majority (68\%) of the users of the current public
   transportation system ended up at wrong destinations at least once; 98\%
   of the users stated that they would like to access a kiosk for their
   route planning needs; and 55\% of the users were even willing to pay for
   such a service. The users overall thought that: the proposed kiosk would
   improve their public transportation experience because it included
   everything needed for transportation, it would make route planning
   easier, it was intuitive and easy to use, and it was accessible in many
   places. The empirical evidence shown by this study validated the UXD
   approaches suggested in the literature. Survey, persona and scenario
   generation, user testing, and mind mapping all were proven to be very
   useful steps to achieve a successful UXD. The design framework presented
   in this article may serve as a reference for the designers.}},

Abstract = {{The Korean government, like many in Asia, is actively building green

   recent scholarly discourse by Anthony Townsend on smart technologies and
   urban planning, and Sofia T. Shwayri and Simon Joss on the
   ubiquitous-eco-city phenomena in Korea. In particular, it aims to extend
   Shwayri's hypothesis that the model is developed for export by
   uncovering the goals of the green city model actors. By tracing the
   national government's economic growth ICT strategyIT839and its key
   industry stakeholders, KT Telecommunications, this paper illuminates how
   Korea's green city model is being driven by an agenda of horizontal
   technology transfer in which the government has aimed to extend its

   smart city, configured as a set of interacting systems with people, is
   focused as a possible model to follow for pursuing sustainability in
   real cities of the twenty-first century. Three processes are recalled:
   city development, city planning theories and city rules. Smart city
   seems to be the convergent point for all processes evolving in European
   urban areas. Theoretical definitions of smart city are recalled. At the
   same time, the European Commission is promoting smart city rules for
   implementation. Moreover, in the last years some local decision-makers
   implemented specific measures that today can be considered in the class
   of smart city measures. The objective of the paper is to analyse the
   European perspectives for smart city, trying to separate the three
   processes that are strongly integrated, but without formal links. To
   verify the European smart city approach, a study case concerning city

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the utilisation of PV systems for electric vehicles
   charging for transportation requirements of smart cities. The gap
   between PV power output and vehicles charging demand is highly variable.
   Therefore, there is a need for additional support from a public
   distribution grid or a storage device in order to handle the residual
   power. Long term measurement data retrieved from a charging station for
   15 vehicles equipped with a PV system were used in the research. Low and
   high irradiation seasons influenced the PV output. The charging demand
   of electric vehicles varied over the course of a year and was correlated
   to weather conditions. Therefore, the sizing and performance of a
   supportive storage device should be evaluated in a statistical manner
   using long period observations.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{4172-4200}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) point cloud labelling of airborne lidar (light
   detection and ranging) data has promising applications in urban city
   modelling. Automatic and efficient methods for semantic labelling of
   airborne urban point cloud data with multiple classes still remains a
   challenge. We propose a novel 3D object-based classification framework
   for labelling urban lidar point cloud using a computer vision technique,
   supervoxels. The supervoxel approach is promising for representing dense
   lidar point cloud in a compact manner for 3D segmentation and for
   improving the computational efficiency. Initially, supervoxels are
   generated by over-segmenting the coloured point cloud using the
   voxel-based cloud connectivity algorithm in the geometric space. The
   local connectivity established between supervoxels has been used to
   produce meaningful and realistic objects (segments). The segments are
   classified by different machine learning techniques based on several
   spectral and geometric features extracted from the segments. All the
   points within a labelled segment are assigned the same segment label.
   Furthermore, the effect of different feature vectors and varying point
   density on the classification accuracy has been studied. Results
   indicate an accurate labelling of points in realistic 3D space
   conforming to the boundaries of objects. An overall classification
   accuracy of 90\% is achieved by the proposed method. The labelled 3D
   points can be used directly for the reconstruction of buildings and
   other man-made objects.}},

Abstract = {{The smart city discourse has gained increasing popularity within
   contemporary cities across the globe, mobilizing powerful economic
   actors and hegemonic public-private coalitions. This article argues
   that, in spite of the common wisdom within critical urban scholarship
   looking at the smart city as a policy framework aligned with the
   interests of powerful private and public actors such as multinational
   corporations and the state, the smart city model of local economic
   regeneration and governance goes beyond this, nurturing a process of
   capitalist variegation, which comprises multinational high-tech firms
   but is not limited to them. Thanks to its adaptability, the smart city
   narrative can be applied to a variety of strategies of economic
   revitalization, as showed by the case of Turin in Italy analysed here: a
   constellation of initiatives including start-up innovative firms,
   infrastructure projects and the social economy. The article argues that
   this variegated economics of the smart city offers still unexplored
   opportunities for a potential politics' of smart urbanism, aimed at
   appropriating the gains of technology for a future of urban social
   justice.}},

Abstract = {{We combine Landsat and MODIS data in the simple biosphere model to
   assess the impact of urbanization on surface climate in Marrakech, circa
   2010.We find the growing season surface temperature differences between
   urban and other cover types to vary between 1.6 degrees C and 6.0
   degrees C at 1:00 p.m., and between 0.7 degrees C and 1.1 degrees C at
   5:00 a.m., local time. Annually however, the built-up area warmed the
   city 0.3 degrees C during daytime and 0.1 degrees C at night compared to
   a simulated preurban situation in which the area was fully vegetated. A
   complete urbanization of the area would decrease its carbon uptake by
   0.13 tons and increase its daytime surface temperature by 1.3 degrees C,
   with 5.72\% increase in energy consumption. However, in a smart urban
   growth scenario, we assume the build-up to cover 50\% of the area,
   allowing it to occur first on bare lands, and then we convert all
   remaining bare lands to orchards; this would counterbalance 60\% of
   daytime warming and sequester 31\% more carbon, compared to the actual
   situation.We find irrigated golf courses to be the most water-consuming
   covers types, requiring 15times the region's summer rainfall, and urban
   areas to distribute 43.8\% of incoming precipitation as surface runoff
   versus only 16.74\% for all other cover types combined. This can be a
   predictor for flash floods.}},

Abstract = {{Today's world is changing rapidly due to advancements in information
   technology, computation and communication. Actuation, communication,
   sensing, and control are becoming ubiquitous. These technological
   advancements have led to the widespread availability of information and
   the possibility to connect systems in unforeseen manner. There is a
   strong desire for smart(er) cities, buildings, devices, factories,
   health monitoring a smarter world. However, designing such a smarter
   world requires addressing also many challenges resulting from the
   emerging complex interactions and interoperation of systems. How is it
   possible to handle the increasing complexity during design and
   maintenance of such systems? How can one guarantee safety and
   performance of systems operating over networks which are subject to
   erroneous communication, delays, and failures of sensors and actuators?
   Is it possible to design control systems which allow for easy
   reconfiguration or even self-organization, for example by letting
   subsystems join and leave larger systems via plug and play strategies?
   Can one guarantee privacy of the controlled subsystems while exchanging
   information, which is necessary for maintaining overall system
   performance? We believe that predictive control is a well suited control
   approach to tackle some of these challenges due to its flexibility with
   respect to the formulation of the problem and the possibility to
   directly take constraints, preview information, as well as models of
   different complexity of the physical world into account. In this
   perspective we limit our attention to three areas we believe predictive
   control methods can provide a basis to tackle the appearing challenges:
   the efficient and easy implementation of predictive control on
   omnipresent embedded computation hardware, the question of resource and
   network aware control, as well as control on the network level of
   systems of systems. We briefly summarize results from these fields and
   outline some ideas on challenges, which arise. (C) 2016 International

Title = {{Governing a city of unicorns: technology capital and the urban politics
   of San Francisco}},
Journal = {{URBAN GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{494-513}},
Abstract = {{San Francisco is now widely considered to be the most important city in
   the world for the location of new technology start-up firms, especially
   high valuation ``unicorns,{''} and is increasingly seen as both a
   locational and metaphorical extension of Silicon Valley. In this paper,
   I trace some of the political strategies and tensions that have
   accompanied the city's prominence in this area, and in particular the
   distinctive role of technology and venture capital in the political
   economy of urban development. The paper has four empirical sections. It
   describes (1) the political machinations surrounding the 2011 and 2015
   municipal elections, which saw the election of Ed Lee as Mayor with
   significant support from individual technology investors such as Ron
   Conway and Marc Benioff, and accompanied by various ``tech-friendly{''}
   policy shifts; (2) the foundation of the ``tech chamber of commerce{''}
   sf. citi as a means of enhancing the policy influence of the tech
   industry in San Francisco; (3) the introduction of a low taxation regime
   in the city's Central Market area that has attracted technology
   companies such as Twitter as tenants; and (4) the urban policy tensions
   associated with the evolution of new ``sharing economy{''} firms such as
   Uber and Airbnb, which have aggressively challenged municipal
   regulations in the taxi and property rental fields. Throughout these
   machinations, we can see a reshaping of capital fractions, with venture
   and angel capital increasingly involved in reengineering the labor,
   housing, and public transport markets of the city in order to circumvent
   the accumulation problems that tech investors had suffered in the
   earlier dot. com failures.}},

Journal = {{URBAN GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},

Pages = {{514-534}},
Abstract = {{In the heyday of the late 2000s financial crisis, austerity urbanism
   became a dominant practice of state financial restructuring-an
   intensification in the encroachment of the neoliberal project into the
   agendas of local governments. In the specific case of Italy, which faced
   political and economic distress between 2011 and 2013, ``smart city{''}
   policies became one of the foundational political technologies for the
   implementation of austerity measures. In this paper, I analyse how the
   smart city provided a lexicon for urban austerity through a series of
   different sites and vehicles of policymaking, from practitioners to
   companies and other institutions. I argue that smart city discourses and
   practices functioned as a political technology that was effective in
   justifying cost containment measures and supporting the shift to
   pro-innovation public expenditures. Yet, at the same time, the smart
   city techno-utopian vocabulary created spaces where other meanings and,
   potentially, alternative political outcomes were made possible by
   diverse alignments of knowledge and expertise.}},

Journal = {{URBAN GEOGRAPHY}},

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{554-571}},
Abstract = {{Investment in the release of open data has become increasingly central
   to the implementation of smart city programs by governments around the
   world. Though originally arising out of a push towards ``open
   government{''} and the pursuit of more transparent decision-making by
   public authorities at multiple scales, open data programs have more
   recently been adopted by municipal governments to support
   entrepreneurial goals of enhanced competitive positioning and attracting
   investment. As urban scholars now subject the smart city project to
   critical scrutiny for its role in advancing urban entrepreneurialism,
   this article considers the relevance of the open data agenda as it
   shapes wider understandings of the smart city. In particular, I address
   the collection of policy practices, aspirations, stakeholders and
   entrepreneurs active in framing the opportunities and values of open
   data for urban governments. Both the momentum of support for open data,
   along with a recent shift in the rhetorical aspirations of the open data
   movement away from the values of openness and transparency and towards a
   more confined focus on value generation, raise important critical
   questions for urban geographers concerned with the nature of urban
   governance in an age of big data.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{572-589}},
Abstract = {{The smart city encompasses a broad range of technological innovations
   which might be applied to any city for a wide variety of reasons. In
   this article, I make a distinction between local efforts to reshape the
   urban landscape, and a global smart city imaginary which those efforts
   draw upon and help sustain. While attention has been given to the
   malleability of the smart city concept at this global scale, there
   remains little effort to interrogate the way that the future is used to
   sanction specific solutions. Through a critical engagement with smart
   city marketing materials, industry documents, and consultancy reports, I
   explore how the future is recruited, rearranged, and represented as a
   rationalization for technological intervention in the present. This is
   performed amidst three recurring crises: massive demographic shifts and
   subsequent resource pressures, global climate change, and the
   conflicting demands of fiscal austerity that motivate the desire of so
   many cities to attract foreign direct investment and highly skilled
   workers. In revealing how crises are pre-empted, precautioned, and
   prepared for, I argue that the smart city imaginary normalizes a style
   and scale of response deemed appropriate under liberal capitalism.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a possible implementation of a cloud-robotics service in a

   cloud robotics paradigm considers robots as simple agents connected to a
   remote network infrastructure; this networked approach allows them to
   benefit from off-board powerful computational and storage resources on
   one hand, and to leverage open data about the urban fabric and common
   knowledge on the other hand. This work describes how the integration of
   a capable, reliable and stable cloud platform, small unmanned vehicles,
   high-bandwidth/low-latency mobile networks and open data publicly
   available on the Internet makes the design of a real-world UAV-based
   emergency management service possible. Simulated and real experiments
   show the feasibility of the approach. Legal and operational issues which

Abstract = {{Water supply throughout China has been depleting, and the management of
   these dwindling resources has posed new and urgent challenges. To
   address these issues, different water supply strategies have been
   developed and evolved. As a result, water conservation and management
   practices must evolve correspondingly. On the other hand, as water
   resource demands continue to grow, local utilities need to adopt and
   implement innovative measurement solutions as part of their water
   management practices(1,2). As an effort to bridge the gap, this research
   focuses on building a Smart Water-Supply System that can become an
   integral part of the city management and the building block of
   low-carbon residential environment to construct the Smart City at
   Guangzhou, China. Both the internal management and citizens service
   requirements are combined into the construction of the system(3,4). The
   designed system has the characteristics of details perception, economy
   and efficiency, self-healing control and interactive service. The
   demonstration of this smart system has achieved very good results by
   promoting users service level, improving the management of water supply
   operation, as well as reducing the energy consumption. The significant
   benefits that can be brought by the proposed system include: transparent
   water consumption to Water-Supply companies and end users, promotion of
   scientific and economic water consumption, large economic benefits to
   Water-Supply Companies, and assistant decision-making for social
   management.}},

Abstract = {{A major societal challenge to be tackled in megacities is sustainable
   urban transportation. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) are
   actually data-centric applications that need to store and query
   real-time as well as historical/static data from various data sources
   and have to provide timely responses to users' transportation needs.
   In this paper we introduce a data management middleware that offers the
   robustness of a common framework to support the development of smart
   applications having the above needs. It supports the efficient storage
   and access to real-time and historical/static data and provides both
   one-time and continuous query capabilities. While the middleware has
   been designed to be general and versatile to support data management for
   any kind of application, in this paper we explore its suitability to ITS
   smart services also by means of an experimental evaluation conducted on
   a variety of traffic scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{To meet the challenges of providing affordable public transit service
   without compromising the financial sustainability of the system, many
   transit systems are setting fares at cost-recovery levels. However, to
   offer affordable transport service for the urban poor, cities can
   provide targeted subsidies. Bogota, Colombia, has implemented a pro-poor
   public transit subsidy scheme that leverages the adoption of smart cards
   in its new public transit system and the country's poverty-targeting
   instruments. This study presents a critical analysis of the rationale,
   design, and implementation of Bogota's public transit subsidy. On the
   basis of this experience, two research questions were explored: What are
   the determinants of the user's self-selection? What are the causal links
   between the subsidy and labor market outcomes of employment and income?
   Two regressions (linear and probabilistic) were used to identify the
   characteristics of individuals who choose to request the subsidized
   fare. A quasi-experimental technique was used for the impact assessment
   of the subsidy on labor market outcomes. This research allows an
   understanding of how to design targeted subsidies for maximum labor
   market outcomes.}},

   variants of classification algorithms that combine clustering with
   classification and introduce appropriate regularization in order to
   concentrate on a sparse set of most relevant features, which has the
   effect of reducing overfitting. Furthermore, the anomaly index we
   introduce combines novel metrics of obstacle irregularity computed based
   on the data captured by the Street Bump smartphone application. Results
   on an actual data set provided by the City of Boston illustrate the
   feasibility and the effectiveness of our system in practice.}},

Title = {{Geo-Social Distance-Based Data Dissemination for Socially Aware
   Networking}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{1444-1453}},
Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT), which could connect everything in the
   world, is promising for the realization of smart cities. However,
   vehicles connected in the IoT challenges data collection and
   transmission. Socially aware networking is an emerging paradigm for
   high-efficiency data dissemination. Existing protocols take advantage of
   mobile nodes' social characteristics (e.g., user interest) to improve
   dissemination performance. However, they have not exploited enough of
   what relations are valuable between user interests and how these
   relations can affect the dissemination of social IoTs. This paper takes
   advantage of interest inclusion and intersection to solve the
   dissemination problem in a conference scenario. By constructing the
   structure of the Interest Tree to solely represent the relations of
   interest inclusion and interest intersection, we integrate vehicles'
   social factors into their geographical information, and introduce the
   concept of geo-social distance (GSD) as the basis of the proposed
   strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our
   presented method by comparing with two other existing protocols in terms
   of four objective metrics, which include delivery ratio, overhead,
   hop-count, and average latency.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a novel approach to design and evaluate `last-mile'
   solutions - encompassing the social and economic perspectives of key
   stakeholders. While urban system initiatives have been implemented in
   practice, theoretical gaps remain at the operational design level. A
   theoretical framework is developed, based on design criteria identified
   from a critical synthesis of supply chain and operations management
   literature, and `operationalised' using an in-depth case study
   demonstrating implementation of a Consumer Choice Portal-Package
   Consolidation Centre solution, within a densely populated urban
   geography. Findings suggest that there is a need to re-define the role
   of institutional actors beyond that of the traditional governance task,
   to one of being able to facilitate performance outcomes. Similarly,
   industrial efficiency dimensions need to be reorientated to include
   consumer participation, social considerations and multi-stakeholder
   service outcomes. Finally, implications for operations theory and
   practising managers in city logistics are highlighted, with suggested
   directions for future research.}},

Title = {{Creatively prototyping the future high street}},
Journal = {{PRODUCTION PLANNING \& CONTROL}},

Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{477-489}},
Abstract = {{This paper gives a voice to a range of community and individual
   stakeholders who would not generally be heard in the conventional town
   planning process. We present a methodological technique, described as
   creative prototyping, that has at its heart, the capability to enable
   full stakeholder inclusivity into the future imagining of the smart
   city. Actively involving these individuals and community representatives
   in the research process enables deeper understanding of how technology
   and people can interact productively to create smart cities that are
   socially inclusive while still being commercially relevant. The research
   data for this paper are drawn from the findings of a workshop conducted
   by the authors that utilised Science Fiction Prototyping and Lego
   Serious Play. This research activity was driven by questions focusing
   upon the current complex interplay and tensions of technology and the
   UK's physical high street. We first explore these issues theoretically
   in previous literature and then drawn upon this review to analyse the
   outcomes of the workshop. Three themes emerge from this analysis that
   have operational and strategic relevance to the development of future
   high streets; the importance of ever present but invisible technology,
   the forefronting of people in the smart city and the need for
   wide-ranging stakeholder input and participation into planning. The
   findings also illustrate that not all future imaginings of the retail
   high street are immediately practical or realistically applicable.
   However, in examining the many issues facing the current high street and
   in negotiating the multiplicity of voices with their competing demands
   and expectations, we offer the conclusion that the future smart city
   must become a place of truly shared sociality - rather than just mere
   proximity, customised convenience or a concentration point for multiple
   forms of entertainment.}},

Abstract = {{Though there has been much talk of smart cities, it is still unclear
   what the concept means and what the role of their inhabitants might be
   in the development of such cities. There is a tendency to focus on
   technology and infrastructure and forget that cities are places for
   people to live. To counter this, smart city planners need to recognise
   that people's needs can and should influence and shape their
   environment, rather than concentrating too much on technology or the
   built environment. In order to understand how smart cities can serve the
   needs of their inhabitants, we will examine the specific example of the
   fashion clothing industry and its development of omni-channel retailing.
   This will show that retailers, driven by technology-smart and
   fashion-conscious consumers, are reshaping the clothing supply chain to
   achieve greater integration, flexibility and speed. Central to this
   process is the manufacturers' ability to create production planning and
   control (PPC) systems capable of operating effectively in an
   omni-channel environment. The paper presents a Composite Model of
   Enterprise Planning which can aid the development of such PPC systems.
   The paper concludes that changes within the fashion clothing industry
   indicate how smart cities can develop and are developing, and that
   although these changes are facilitated by technology, they are driven by
   the necessity to meet consumers' needs.}},

Pages = {{500-513}},
Abstract = {{Future cities are driven by the developments in Information and
   Communication Technology to support the triple bottom line requirements
   of sustainability. Logistics will play a critical role in future cities
   due to the increasingly micro-dynamic nature of socio-economics of these
   cities and globalised production and consumption patterns. Enterprise
   systems (ES), the founding applications to automate and integrate
   different business processes, will be the key enablers for providing the
   necessary support required by the future city logistics. However, the
   implementation of ES and realisation of proposed benefits within the
   estimated time frame is challenging due to the huge resource
   requirements in terms of manpower, budget and time. This study takes the
   antecedent (critical success factors) approach for the implementation
   process to establish a success predictive model for the realisation of
   ES benefits. The partial least square regression has been used to test
   the model. Moreover, this study explores the impact of ES benefits on
   the logistics performance indicators to explore the synergies between
   them. This is fundamentally important because future city logistics will
   rely heavily on appropriately designed and implemented (enterprise)
   information systems.}},

Abstract = {{Our world and our lives are changing in many ways. Communication,
   networking, and computing technologies are among the most influential
   enablers that shape our lives today. Digital data and connected worlds
   of physical objects, people, and devices are rapidly changing the way we
   work, travel, socialize, and interact with our surroundings, and they
   have a profound impact on different domains, such as healthcare,
   environmental monitoring, urban systems, and control and management
   applications, among several other areas. Cities currently face an
   increasing demand for providing services that can have an impact on
   people's everyday lives. The CityPulse framework supports smart city
   service creation by means of a distributed system for semantic
   discovery, data analytics, and interpretation of large-scale
   (near-)real-time Internet of Things data and social media data streams.
   To goal is to break away from silo applications and enable cross-domain
   data integration. The CityPulse framework integrates multimodal, mixed
   quality, uncertain and incomplete data to create reliable, dependable
   information and continuously adapts data processing techniques to meet
   the quality of information requirements from end users. Different than
   existing solutions that mainly offer unified views of the data, the
   CityPulse framework is also equipped with powerful data analytics
   modules that perform intelligent data aggregation, event detection,
   quality assessment, contextual filtering, and decision support. This
   paper presents the framework, describes its components, and demonstrates
   how they interact to support easy development of custom-made
   applications for citizens. The benefits and the effectiveness of the
   framework are demonstrated in a use-case scenario implementation
   presented in this paper.}},

   within smart cities which has been changed the development of urban
   areas and effected firms' innovativeness. The paper aims to discuss
   these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - A case study methodology on a leading
   multinational firms deeply involved in smart cities projects has been
   chosen.
   Findings - From this study it emerged how IBM: has a clear vision of
   smart cities and IoT; adopt a worldwide OI approach to smart cities;
   delineate-specific strategies and create OI units ad hoc for smart
   cities' projects.
   Research limitations/implications - The major limitation of this work is
   that the analysis presented has been developed only on one case of
   multinational firm that operate in smart cities contexts.
   Practical implications - Recommendations will be made both to public and
   private actor in order to plan and implement efficient strategies to
   improve their performances.
   Originality/value - The concept of smart city has become quite popular
   between scholars and practitioners in the era of digital economy. Cities
   become smart developing new urban area using new Information and
   Communication Technologies such as mobile devices, the semantic web,
   cloud computing, and the IoT. Smart cities make innovation ecosystem,
   joining together different forces like knowledge-intensive activities,
   institutions for cooperation and learning, and web-based applications

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a foot patrol and
   citizen contact-based policing intervention in a suburb outside Dallas.
   Funded by the Bureau of Justice Assistance ``Smart Policing{''}
   initiative, the intervention consisted of assigning a single bilingual
   officer to an economically disadvantaged apartment complex in the heart
   of the city.
   Design/methodology/approach - An examination of calls for service across
   several offense types was performed for the target complex, the adjacent
   neighborhood, and a nearby apartment complex. The aims of the study were
   to determine whether the intervention affected specific calls for
   service and geographic and/or temporal displacement/diffusion occurred.
   Findings - Two key findings emerged. First, the intervention produced
   several hypothesized reductions and increases in specific call types,
   but temporal displacement rendered those effects short-lived. Second,
   diffusion to surrounding areas was observed and persisted through
   various treatment dosages.
   Practical implications - The study provides useful information to
   practitioners who might seek to implement foot-patrol-based tactics in
   hot spots and micro-places. However, foot patrol and/or citizen contact
   patrol alone may not yield sustainable crime reductions in their target
   areas.
   Originality/value - Few recent studies have examined the efficacy of
   foot patrol in crime hot spots. No recent studies have evaluated citizen
   contact patrol within micro-places. This study sought to address both
   limitations.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{321-331}},
Abstract = {{The prevalence of urban sprawl, amplified levels of auto dependency, and
   nonwork travel during the afternoon peak hours have resulted in a steady
   increase in unsustainable patterns of travel in Canadian cities. Active
   and green modes of transportation along with smart growth have been
   promoted as a panacea. This article investigates the efficacy of such
   sustainable urban mobility strategies in Windsor, Ontario, using data
   records from a Household Travel Survey. Multinomial and mixed-logit
   models are developed to identify the factors influencing nonwork mode
   choice travel behavior. Next, the models are used in a scenario-building
   and simulation exercise to illustrate the benefits attained from jointly
   improving public transit, encouraging smart growth development, and
   lowering vehicle ownership. Based on the obtained results, embracing
   single-policy instruments is not an effective approach for reducing auto
   dependency in the study area. However, adopting a multidimensional
   policy approach that integrates land use and transportation policy
   instruments is proven more effective for achieving sustainable outcomes.
   It is recommended that the service and facilities for transit and
   nonmotorized modes be improved, and easier access to commercial and
   recreational activities be enhanced through progressive improvements to
   the built environment. Adoption of smart-growth strategies should be
   also pursued by planners and decision makers to create an environment
   conducive to reducing the levels of auto ownership. Such a goal is of
   paramount importance for sustainability because the level of auto
   ownership emerged as the most important policy instrument for reducing
   auto dependency in the study area.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{41-47}},
Abstract = {{In what sense is a city smart? There are established entities defining
   this rich area of cross-disciplinary studies, and they refer to social,
   technical, economic, and political factors that keep evolving, thus
   offering opportunities for constant refinement of the concept of smart
   city. The emerging properties are mostly contextual, and affect urban
   data types and their capacity to form complex information systems. A
   well-known problem in computational analysis is the integration of lot
   of generated data. The heterogeneity and diversity of smart city data
   sources suggest that a system's approach could be ideal to assemble
   drivers of multiple forces and dynamics, suggesting adaptive solutions
   too. However, the nature of such systems is quite unpredictable and
   chaotic, leading to the natural aim of stabilizing them. Studies have
   proposed methods based on various criteria, say parametric, entropic,

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of the next-generation communication and networks is
   bringing video services into more pervasive environments. More and more
   users access and interact with video content using different devices,
   such as smart televisions, personal computers, tablets, smartphones, and
   wearable equipments. Providing heterogeneous Quality of Experience (QoE)
   that supports a wide variety of multimedia devices is critical to video
   broadcasting over the next-generation wireless network. This paper
   reviews practical video broadcasting technologies and examines current
   requirements ranging from heterogeneous devices to transmission
   technologies. Meanwhile, various coding methodologies, including QoE
   modeling, scalable compression efficiency, and flexible transmission,
   are also discussed. Moreover, this paper presents a typical paradigm as
   an example for video broadcasting with large-scale heterogeneity
   support, which enables QoE mapping, joint coding, flexible forward error
   coding, and cross-layer transmission, as well as optimal and dynamic
   adaptation to improve the overall receiving quality of heterogeneous
   devices. Finally, a brief summary of the key ideas and a discussion of
   interesting open areas are summarized at the end of this paper along
   with a future recommendation.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Resource Partitioning for Heterogeneous Multi-Core-Based Cloud
   Computing in Smart Cities}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{108-118}},
Abstract = {{As the smart cities emerged for more comfortable urban spaces, services,
   such as health, transportation, and so on, need to be promoted. In
   addition, the cloud computing provides flexible allocation, migration of
   services, and better security isolation; therefore, it is the
   infrastructure for the smart cities. Single instruction-set architecture
   (ISA) heterogeneous multi-core processors have higher performance per
   watt than their symmetric counterparts and are popular in current
   processors. In current cloud computing, which integrates a few fast
   out-of-order cores, coupled with a large number of simpler, slow cores,
   all cores expose the same ISA. The best way to leverage the
   effectiveness of these systems is to accelerate sequential CPU-bound
   threads using fast cores, and to improve the throughput of parallel
   memory-bound threads using slow cores. However, shared hardware
   resources, such as memory, respond to requests from all cores, which
   interfere with each other, leading to both low speed for fast cores and
   low throughput for slow cores. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
   resource partitioning (DRP) method for single-ISA heterogeneous
   multi-cores, which partitions the shared resources according to both
   threads' requirements for the shared resources and the performance of
   their running cores. The key principle is to profile both threads'
   resource characteristics at run-time and the performance of the cores
   that the threads are running on to estimate demands for resources. Then,
   we use the estimation to direct our resource partitioning. Moreover, we
   integrate our DRP with current memory scheduling policies to improve the
   system performance further for the two methods being orthogonal.}},

Abstract = {{The design of solutions that are able to exploit the available data
   collected in smart cities environments can lead to insights that can
   guide the implementation of approaches that have the potential to

Title = {{BEST-MAC: Bitmap-Assisted Efficient and Scalable TDMA-Based WSN MAC
   Protocol for Smart Cities}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{312-322}},
Abstract = {{Smart cities have been envisioned during the last decade. Moreover,
   various projects have been initiated to bring this concept into reality.
   Smart city is basically an emergence of the existing and new Information
   and Communications Technologies (ICT) to make our living standard more
   safe and digitized. Wireless communications, such as sensors, actuators,
   intelligent transportation systems, and smart grids, have played a vital
   role in the dissemination of information under the given circumstances.
   Similarly, it is hard to declare any city as a smart city without taking
   benefits from wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, with new
   requirements and delay sensitive applications, the existing WSN requires
   significant alterations at several layers. In this paper, a new time
   division multiple access (IDMA)-based medium access control (MAC)
   protocol, called bitmap-assisted efficient and scalable IDMA-based MAC
   (BEST-MAC), is proposed for adaptive traffic in hierarchical WSNs that
   can be deployed in the smart cities. BEST-MAC is specifically designed
   to improve the quality control of such smart cities applications, where
   diverse traffic is required and loss or delay in data traffic is
   unacceptable. The main contributions of BEST-MAC include: 1) it uses
   small size time slots; 2) the number of those time slots is more than
   the number of member nodes; 3) knapsack algorithm is used to schedule
   time slots; and 4) short node address (1 B) is proposed to identify the
   member nodes. First two contributions of BEST-MAC handle adaptive
   traffic loads of all members in an efficient manner. The knapsack
   algorithm not only reduces the job completion time of a node but also
   minimizes the average packet delay with better link utilization. The
   short node address reduces the control overhead that improves the energy
   efficiency. The simulation results verify that the proposed BEST-MAC
   transmits more data with less delay and energy consumption compared with
   the existing MAC protocols.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{373-382}},
Abstract = {{Comprehensive understandings to the built environment especially the
   urban form is a prerequisite for building a smart city. This paper is
   based on computational methods to examine the urban fabric of Hankou,
   China, as a case study. Quantitative and comparative analyses are
   involved to understand the characteristics on the block scale, where
   massive demolition and new construction coincide with the existing
   historical context. Five urban fabric indicators are defined (i.e.,
   density, compactness, fragmentation, variance, and cohesion) to conduct
   a case study for the 83 selected blocks using geographic information
   system tools and statistical analysis. Distribution patterns and
   correlations between these indicators are analyzed. Comparisons are made
   between typical blocks with high, median, and low fabric densities using
   comprehensive fabric indicators. The research results indicate that the
   organic order of the original urban fabric is facing damage, especially
   from arbitrary demolition, overinfilling, and spontaneous encroachment.
   Finally, this paper discusses how retaining the urban fabric makes the
   city a vibrant place to live. The sustainable development of a city
   should attach great importance to the protection and continuation of
   local characteristics of integrity and authenticity. The described
   analytical methods could contribute to the optimization of urban design
   strategies for future smart cities.}},

Title = {{A Hierarchical Security Framework for Defending Against Sophisticated
   Attacks on Wireless Sensor Networks in Smart Cities}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{416-424}},
Abstract = {{In smart cities, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) act as a type of core
   infrastructure that collects data from the city to implement smart
   services. The security of WSNs is one of the key issues of smart cities.
   In resource-restrained WSNs, dynamic ongoing or unknown attacks usually
   steer clear of isolated defense components. Therefore, to resolve this
   problem, we propose a hierarchical framework based on chance discovery
   and usage control (UCON) technologies to improve the security of WSNs
   while still taking the low-complexity and high security requirements of
   WSNs into account. The features of continuous decision and dynamic
   attributes in UCON can address ongoing attacks using advanced persistent
   threat detection. In addition, we use a dynamic adaptive chance
   discovery mechanism to detect unknown attacks. To design and implement a
   system using the mechanism described above, a unified framework is
   proposed in which low-level attack detection with simple rules is
   performed in sensors, and high-level attack detection with complex rules
   is performed in sinks and at the base station. Moreover,
   software-defined networking and network function virtualization
   technologies are used to perform attack mitigation when either low-level
   or high-level attacks are detected. An experiment was performed to
   acquire an attack data set for evaluation. Then, a simulation was
   created to evaluate the resource consumption and attack detection rate.
   The results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed
   scheme.}},

Title = {{Differentiation Presentation for Sustaining Internet Access in a
   Disaster-Resilient Homogeneous Wireless Infrastructure}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{514-528}},
Abstract = {{A wireless multihop infrastructure (WMI) employs homogeneous and easily
   deployable wireless routers to facilitate disaster-resilient Internet
   access in smart cities, emergency situations, and the Internet of
   Things. On the other hand, however, a WMI is subject to energy
   constraints, carries unbalanced traffic, and has weaknesses in terms of
   maintenance, such as the lack of human management. Therefore,
   efficiently sharing network tasks and energy consumption in a WMI are
   essential to network sustainability. In this paper, we consider the
   problem of explicit differentiation presentation for improving network
   sustainability, which involves two aspects. One is the problem of
   quantifying the differentiation of network activities and energy
   consumption. The other is the problem of utilizing the differentiation
   factor of each node for routing operations so as to regulate network
   packet flows for sustaining Internet access in a WMI. We examine the
   differentiation of network activities and energy consumption in WMIs by
   considering network activities, including not only packet transmission
   and reception but also packet overhearing, and other types of energy
   consumption. Based on the quantification of energy differentiation at
   each base station (BS), we design a novel router metric that enables an
   efficient sharing of network activities among BSs. The theoretical
   analyses of energy differentiation were validated based on the packet
   level simulation. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed
   router metric based on energy differentiation outperforms various other
   competitive metrics of multihop wireless networks to improve network
   sustainability for different network models.}},

Title = {{Anchor-Assisted and Vote-Based Trustworthiness Assurance in Smart City
   Crowdsensing}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{529-541}},
Abstract = {{Smart city sensing calls for crowdsensing via mobile devices that are
   equipped with various built-in sensors. As incentivizing users to
   participate in distributed sensing is still an open research issue, the
   trustworthiness of crowdsensed data is expected to be a grand challenge
   if this cloud-inspired recruitment of sensing services is to be adopted.
   Recent research proposes reputation-based user recruitment models for
   crowdsensing; however, there is no standard way of identifying
   adversaries in smart city crowdsensing. This paper adopts previously
   proposed vote-based approaches, and presents a thorough performance
   study of vote-based trustworthiness with trusted entities that are
   basically a subset of the participating smartphone users. Those entities
   are called trustworthy anchors of the crowdsensing system. Thus, an
   anchor user is fully trustworthy and is fully capable of voting for the
   trustworthiness of other users, who participate in sensing of the same
   set of phenomena. Besides the anchors, the reputations of regular users
   are determined based on vote-based (distributed) reputation. We present
   a detailed performance study of the anchor-based trustworthiness
   assurance in smart city crowdsensing through simulations, and compare it
   with the purely vote-based trustworthiness approach without anchors, and
   a reputation-unaware crowdsensing approach, where user reputations are
   discarded. Through simulation findings, we aim at providing
   specifications regarding the impact of anchor and adversary populations
   on crowdsensing and user utilities under various environmental settings.
   We show that significant improvement can be achieved in terms of
   usefulness and trustworthiness of the crowdsensed data if the size of
   the anchor population is set properly.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Recovery of Wireless Multi-Hop Infrastructure With the
   Autonomous Mobile Base Station}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{627-638}},
Abstract = {{Wireless multihop infrastructures (WMIs) are promising network platforms
   that facilitate applications, such as smart cities, emergency responses,
   and outdoor events. WMIs can allow coverage over large areas with low
   setup and maintenance overheads. However, WMIs may be susceptible to
   loss of network connectivity caused by node damage or energy depletion.
   The end-to-end reachability is essential for the WMI to provide network
   service to users. This paper studies the problem of network
   self-recovery to sustain reachability in a WMI network by utilizing
   autonomous mobile base stations (MBSs). It is assumed that MBS is able
   to move to and pause or stop at positions in the network area. An MBS
   could be a self-driving robotic vehicle, or vehicle driven directly or
   remotely by a human. The proposed MBS approach, MBS-Fit, is a
   distributed and packet-interaction-based mechanism that allows MBS to
   automatically construct new routes, assess, and adaptively respond to
   the fitness of pause positions, such that MBS can provide links to
   recover the disconnected WMIs. We adopt packet-level evaluation to study
   the automatic interactions of MBS with the static WMI objects. In
   particular, the network reachability is measured by the amount of
   packets successfully delivered from users to the gateway through the
   WMI. Simulation results reveal that the proposed MBS-Fit approach
   achieves up to 30\% improvement of network reachability in terms of
   successfully packet delivery compared with the conventional MBS. MBS-Fit
   mechanism also enables up to 80\% improvement in terms of number of
   packets forwarded at MBS.}},

Abstract = {{Smart cities appear as the next stage of urbanization aiming to not only
   exploit physical and digital infrastructure for urban development but
   also the intellectual and social capital as its core ingredient for
   urbanization. Smart cities harness the power of data from sensors in
   order to understand and manage city systems. The most important of these
   sensing devices are smartphones as they provide the most important means
   to connect the smart city systems with its citizens, allowing
   personalization n and cocreation. The battery lifetime of smartphones is
   one of the most important parameters in achieving good user experience
   for the device. Therefore, the management and the optimization of
   handheld device applications in relation to their power consumption are
   an important area of research. This paper investigates the relationship
   between the energy consumption of a localization application and the
   strength of the global positioning system (GPS) signal. This is an
   important focus, because location-based applications are among the top
   power-hungry applications. We conduct experiments on two android
   location-based applications, one developed by us, and the other one, off
   the shelf. We use the results from the measurements of the two
   applications to derive a mathematical model that describes the power
   consumption in smartphones in terms of SNR and the time to first fix.
   The results from this study show that higher SNR values of GPS signals
   do consume less energy, while low GPS signals causing faster battery
   drain (38\% as compared with 13\%). To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first study that provides a quantitative understanding of how the
   poor strength (SNR) of satellite signals will cause relatively higher
   power drain from a smartphone's battery.}},

Title = {{Autonomous WiFi Sensor for Heating Systems in the Internet of Things}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{In smart cities and home applications, the use of Wireless Sensor
   Networks to extract environmental data becomes more common with the
   passing of time. These sensors are used for a wide array of
   applications, but mainly to manage energy consumption in domestic
   buildings. One of the key energy consumers in households is heating
   systems. To monitor them, sensors are used with wireless communication
   protocols, like ZigBee, to transmit data to a central processing unit
   (CPU). WiFi communications, on the contrary, are rarely seen in these
   implementations due to its high energy consumption, although almost in
   every home one can find such networks. Yet, with the Internet of Things
   (IoT), new revisions of the standard have arisen which enable this
   technology for wireless sensing. To validate this theory and fill a
   technological necessity, this proposal is presented. In this work, the
   design and implementation of an autonomous WiFi sensor, paired with
   thermoelectric energy harvesting, are presented as an IoT solution for
   monitoring heating devices. For this, a thorough analysis of the
   proposed architecture is presented. Tests regarding energy consumption
   and generation, efficiency, and real world scenario trials are done.
   Finalizing, a comparison between the obtained results and current
   implementations is shown.}},

Title = {{A Mobile Information System Based on Crowd-Sensed and Official Crime
   Data for Finding Safe Routes: A Case Study of Mexico City}},
Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Abstract = {{Mobile information systems agendas are increasingly becoming an
   essential part of human life and they play an important role in several
   daily activities. These have been developed for different contexts such
   as public facilities in smart cities, health care, traffic congestions,
   e-commerce, financial security, user-generated content, and
   crowdsourcing. In GIScience, problems related to routing systems have
   been deeply explored by using several techniques, but they are not
   focused on security or crime rates. In this paper, an approach to
   provide estimations defined by crime rates for generating safe routes in
   mobile devices is proposed. It consists of integrating crowd-sensed and
   official crime data with a mobile application. Thus, data are
   semantically processed by an ontology and classified by the Bayes
   algorithm. A geospatial repository was used to store tweets related to
   crime events of Mexico City and official reports that were geocoded for
   obtaining safe routes. A forecast related to crime events that can occur
   in a certain place with the collected information was performed. The
   novelty is a hybrid approach based on semantic processing to retrieve
   relevant data from unstructured data sources and a classifier algorithm
   to collect relevant crime data from official government reports with a
   mobile application.}},

Title = {{Intelligent Testing of Traffic Light Programs: Validation in Smart
   Mobility Scenarios}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{In smart cities, the use of intelligent automatic techniques to find
   efficient cycle programs of traffic lights is becoming an innovative
   front for traffic flow management. However, this automatic programming
   of traffic lights requires a validation process of the generated
   solutions, since they can affect the mobility (and security) of millions
   of citizens. In this paper, we propose a validation strategy based on
   genetic algorithms and feature models for the automatic generation of
   different traffic scenarios checking the robustness of traffic light
   cycle programs. We have concentrated on an extensive urban area in the
   city of Malaga (in Spain), in which we validate a set of candidate cycle
   programs generated bymeans of four optimization algorithms: Particle
   Swarm Optimization for Traffic Lights, Differential Evolution for
   Traffic Lights, random search, and Sumo Cycle Program Generator. We can
   test the cycles of traffic lights considering the different states of
   the city, weather, congestion, driver expertise, vehicle's features, and
   so forth, but prioritizing the most relevant scenarios among a large and
   varied set of them. The improvement achieved in solution quality is
   remarkable, especially for CO 2 emissions, in which we have obtained a
   reduction of 126.99\% compared with the experts' solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The products and services designed for Smart Cities provide the
   necessary tools to improve the management of modern cities in a more
   efficient way. These tools need to gather citizens' information about

   order to satisfy and manage the legislative heterogeneity surrounding
   the services provided and comply with the laws of the country where they
   are provided. This paper presents one of the possible solutions to
   manage this heterogeneity, bearing in mind these types of networks, such
   as Wireless Sensor Networks, have important resource limitations. A
   knowledge and ontology management system is proposed to facilitate the
   collaboration between the business, legal and technological areas. This
   will ease the implementation of adequate specific security and privacy

Abstract = {{The vehicle detection process plays the key role in determining the
   success of intelligent transport management system solutions. The
   measurement of distortions of the Earth's magnetic field using magnetic
   field sensors served as the basis for designing a solution aimed at
   vehicle detection. In accordance with the results obtained from research
   into process modeling and experimentally testing all the relevant
   hypotheses an algorithm for vehicle detection using the state criteria
   was proposed. Aiming to evaluate all of the possibilities, as well as
   pros and cons of the use of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) sensors
   in the transport flow control process, we have performed a series of
   experiments with various vehicles (or different series) from several car
   manufacturers. A comparison of 12 selected methods, based on either the
   process of determining the peak signal values and their concurrence in
   time whilst calculating the delay, or by measuring the cross-correlation
   of these signals, was carried out. It was established that the relative
   error can be minimized via the Z component cross-correlation and K-z
   criterion cross-correlation methods. The average relative error of
   vehicle speed determination in the best case did not exceed 1.5\% when
   the distance between sensors was set to 2 m.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the key components of the emerging
   Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm. They are now ubiquitous and used in a
   plurality of application domains. WSNs are still domain specific and
   usually deployed to support a specific application. However, as WSNs'
   nodes are becoming more and more powerful, it is getting more and more
   pertinent to research how multiple applications could share a very same
   WSN infrastructure. Virtualization is a technology that can potentially
   enable this sharing. This paper is a survey on WSN virtualization. It
   provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art and an in-depth
   discussion of the research issues. We introduce the basics of WSN
   virtualization and motivate its pertinence with carefully selected
   scenarios. Existing works are presented in detail and critically
   evaluated using a set of requirements derived from the scenarios. The
   pertinent research projects are also reviewed. Several research issues
   are also discussed with hints on how they could be tackled.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, various Portable Navigation Devices (PND) such as
   smart-phones are becoming popular as a vehicle navigation device. To
   compare with a conventional built-in navigation system, PND has
   advantages that it is low cost and easily mounted to the vehicle. On the
   other hand, PND has also disadvantage that in the most case it cannot
   obtain the reliable vehicle speed information such as wheel pulse
   information and that induces degradation of vehicle trajectory
   estimation (dead-reckoning). The vehicle trajectory estimation is the
   positioning method using inertial sensors, and generally used when GPS
   is not available. So in urban area where GPS signals are blocked or
   reflected by tall buildings, the degradation of vehicle trajectory
   estimation may cause the severe increase of position error. Accordingly,
   in this study two approaches are proposed to improve vehicle trajectory
   estimation with PND. The first one is the accurate speed estimation
   using time-series tightly coupled integration of accelerometer, gyro,
   and Doppler shift of GPS. And the second one is the correction of
   trajectory error using backward refinement that can work even in
   real-time processing. The experimental result in Shinjuku which is dense
   urban city shows that the error of vehicle trajectory estimation was
   reduced to 1/4 compared with the previous method.}},

Title = {{Matching of Energy Provisions in Multihop Wireless Infra-Structures}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recently there have been large advances in energy technologies for
   battery-operated systems, including green energy resources and high
   capacity batteries. The effective use of battery energy resources in
   wireless infrastructure networks to improve the versatility and
   reliability of wireless communications is an important issue. Emerging
   applications of smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT), and emergency
   responses highly rely on the basic communication network infrastructures
   that enable ubiquitous network connections. However, energy consumption
   by nodes in a wireless infrastructure network depends on the
   transmissions of other nodes in the network. Considering this
   inter-dependence is necessary to achieve efficient provision of energy
   in wireless networks. This paper studies the issue of energy provision
   for wireless relay nodes in Wireless Multihop Infrastructures (WMI)
   assuming constraints on the total energy provision. We introduce a
   scheme of Energy Provision Matching (Matching-EP) for WMI which
   optimizes energy provision based on matching of energy provision with
   estimates of differentiated position-dependent energy consumption by
   wireless nodes distributed in the network. The evaluation results show
   that Matching-EP with 4\%-34\% improvement in energy matching degree
   enables 10\%-40\% improvement of the network lifetime, and 5\%-40\%
   improvement of packet delivery compared with conventional WMI networks.}},

Title = {{Prefetching Scheme for Massive Spatiotemporal Data in a Smart City}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Employing user access patterns to develop a prefetching scheme can
   effectively improve system I/O performance and reduce user access
   latency. For massive spatiotemporal data, traditional pattern mining
   methods fail to directly reflect the spatiotemporal correlation and
   transition rules of user access, resulting in poor prefetching
   performance. This paper proposed a prefetching scheme based on
   spatial-temporal attribute prediction, named STAP. It maps the history
   of user access requests to the spatiotemporal attribute domain by
   analyzing the characteristics of spatiotemporal data in a smart city.
   According to the spatial locality and time stationarity of user access,
   correlation analysis is performed and variation rules are identified for
   the history of user access requests. Further, the STAP scheme mines the
   user access patterns and constructs a predictive function to predict the
   user's next access request. Experimental results show that the
   prefetching scheme is simple yet effective; it achieves a prediction
   accuracy of 84.3\% for access requests and reduces the average data
   access response time by 44.71\% compared with the nonprefetching scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the number of surveillance video data has grown enormously
   since the popularity of the smart cities, which brings the difficulties
   to users for searching and analyzing the content of the videos. These
   video data are not limited to data anymore, which provide the effective
   information for criminal investigation systems, intrusion detection
   system, and many others. However, as the number of available cloud
   services increases, the problem of data discovery and selection arises.
   The semantic technology is an effective choice for enhancing the
   accurate of the data searching and analyzing process. In this paper, a
   semantic based cloud environment is proposed to facilitate the analyzing
   and searching process of surveillance video data. An architecture
   integrating ontology building, semantic annotation, and semantic search
   is proposed to leverage the semantic description of the video data to
   find them from concept-based level. A semantic intermediate layer which
   organizes the video data based on their semantic relations is given.
   Moreover, the proposed method is used in the intelligent transportation
   field, which shows the bright prospect of the proposed method in real

Journal = {{AI COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{57-75}},
Abstract = {{Smart city initiatives rely on real-time measurements and data collected
   by a large number of heterogenous physical sensors deployed throughout a
   city. Physical sensors, however, are fraught with interoperability,
   dependability, management and political challenges. Furthermore, these
   sensors are unable to sense the opinions and emotional reactions of
   citizens that invariably impact smart city initiatives. Yet everyday,
   millions of dwellers and visitors of a city share their observations,
   thoughts, feelings and experiences, or in other words, their perceptions
   about their city through social media updates. This paper reasons why
   ``human sensors{''}, namely, citizens that share information about their
   surroundings via social media can supplement, complement, or even
   replace the information measured by physical sensors. We present a
   methodology based on probabilistic language modeling to extract and
   visualize such perceptions that may be relevant to smart cities from
   social media updates. Using more than six million geo-tagged tweets
   collected over regions that feature widely varying geographical, social,
   cultural and political characteristics and tweet densities, we
   illustrate the potential of social media enabled human sensing to
   address diverse smart city challenges.}},

Abstract = {{By the year 2050, more than 70\% of the world's population will be
   living in cities. The rush to the cities, along with subsequent
   increased consumption patterns, has dire consequences, for the
   ecological systems that sustain human life. Some find hope in the
   potential that cities can be built differently, that green
   infrastructure and denser forms of development, will satisfy human needs
   while decreasing the stress on valuable resources and mitigating
   consequences of climate change. Some say that ``strong political
   leadership and robust governance{''} is critical for this need to drive
   sustainable urban transitions. However, are ``political will{''} and
   ``good governance{''} enough or is the issue more complicated than this?
   Using a critical political economy approach this paper shows the
   fundamental difficulties that arise when attempting to transition urban
   centres to ``smarter{''}, more ``sustainable{''} and ``resilient{''}
   cities. Ultimately, the paper argues that ``good governance{''} and
   ``strong political will{''} are inadequate for understanding the
   requirements for transformation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are emerging as a very useful tool
   for gathering, processing, and providing data to vehicles and
   passengers. It is expected that vehicles equipped with a variety of
   sensors will play a determining role in Intelligent Transportation
   System (ITS) and Smart City applications. With the evolution of VANET
   services comes the need for solutions to increase the availability of
   content to users. To this end, we propose a Geo-Localized
   Origin-Destination-based Content Replication (GO-DCR) solution that
   relies on vehicles' origin and destination points to decide which of
   them are more appropriate to replicate content inside a region of
   interest. We compare GO-DCR with two existing solutions through
   extensive simulations, The results show that GO-DCR increases content
   availability and reduces the cost of delivery. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The transport sector is fundamental for the economy but also for
   personal life. With a growing population and the globalization process,
   it is not surprising that the demand of transport is set to grow in the
   near future and certainly until 2050. This paper focuses on the huge
   potential of progress in the sector of technology for transport. As the
   principal sector for transport will remain on roads, the paper
   emphasizes the progress in the automotive sector. Since car
   manufacturers are investing massively into research and technology
   development to offer ever more efficient cars-not only energy efficient
   but also efficient in terms of safety and comfort-the car of tomorrow
   will be very different from the present one. The increasing role of
   electronics in cars will synergistically cooperate with that of
   so-called smart cities. The potential development of methane in the
   transport sector, mainly used for heavy transportation is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting faults in electrical power grids is of paramount importance,
   both from the electricity operator and consumer point of view. Modern
   electric power grids (smart grids) are equipped with smart sensors that
   allow to gather real-time information regarding the physical status of
   all components belonging to the whole infrastructure (e.g., cables and
   related insulation, transformers, and breakers). In real-world smart
   grid systems, usually, additional information that are related to the
   operational status of the grid are collected, such as meteorological
   information. Designing an efficient recognition model to discriminate
   faults in real-world smart grid system is hence a challenging task. This
   follows from the heterogeneity of the information that actually
   determine a typical fault condition. In this paper, we deal with the
   problem of modeling and recognizing faults in a real-world smart grid
   system, which supplies the entire city of Rome, Italy. Recognition of
   faults is addressed by following a combined approach of dissimilarity
   measures learning and one-class classification techniques. We provide
   here an in-depth study related to the available data and to the models
   based on the proposed one-class classification approach. Furthermore, we
   perform a comprehensive analysis of the fault recognition results by
   exploiting a fuzzy set based decision rule. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},

Abstract = {{Over the last couple of decades, metropolitan areas around the world
   have been engaged in a multitude of initiatives aimed at upgrading urban
   infrastructure and services, with a view to creating better
   environmental, social and economic conditions and enhancing cities'
   attractiveness and competitiveness. Reflecting these developments, many
   new categories of `cities' have entered the policy discourse:
   `sustainable cities'; `green cities'; `digital cities'; `smart cities';
   intelligent cities'; `information cities'; `knowledge cities';
   `resilient cities'; `eco cities': `low carbon cities'; `liveable
   cities'; and even combinations, such as `low carbon eco cities' and
   `ubiquitous eco cities'. In practice, these terms often appear to be
   used interchangeably by policy makers, planners and developers. However,
   the question arises whether these categories nevertheless each embody
   distinct conceptual perspectives, which would have implications for how
   they are understood theoretically and applied in policy. In response,
   this article investigates, through a comprehensive bibliometric
   analysis, how the twelve most frequent city categories are
   conceptualised individually and in relation to one another in the
   academic literature. We hypothesize that, notwithstanding some degree of
   overlap and cross-fertilization, in their essence the observed
   categories each harbor particular conceptual perspectives that render
   them distinctive. This is borne out by the findings, which demonstrate
   robustly for the first time the conceptual differences and
   interrelationships among twelve dominant city categories. The
   `sustainable city' is the most frequently occurring category and, in a
   map of keyword co-occurrences, by far the largest and most
   interconnected node, linked closely to the `eco city' and `green city'
   concepts. Recently, the more narrow concepts of low carbon city' and
   `smart city' have been on the rise, judging by their frequency of
   occurrence in academic journals; the latter in particular appears to
   have become an increasingly dominant category of urban modernization
   policy. On their part, `resilient city' and `knowledge city' represent
   distinct concepts, albeit with comparatively low frequency. Overall, the
   findings point to the need for rigor and nuance in the use of these
   terms, not least if one wishes to comprehend their implications for
   urban development and regeneration policy and practice. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{One of the most challenging objectives of the Internet of Things (IoT)
   domain is the identification of interaction paradigms and communication
   standards to integrate smart objects (SOs), i.e., physical objects able
   to interact with the network. Such interaction paradigms and
   communication protocols belong to what can be called the IoT application
   layer, on which this paper focuses. This paper presents app execution
   platform (AEP), a platform that supports the design, deployment,
   execution, and management of IoT applications in the domain of smart
   home, smart car, and smart city. AEP was designed to coherently fulfill
   a set of requirements covered only partially or in a fragmented way by
   other IoT application platforms. AEP focuses on SO virtualization and on
   composite application (CA) orchestration and supports dynamic object
   availability.}},

Abstract = {{A transformation of our current transport system and individual mobility
   behaviour is an essential prerequisite for attaining a desirable future
   that enables a life within environmental boundaries ({''}safe operating
   space{''}) and higher well-being at the same time. Accordingly, this
   paper focuses on the potentials of a resource-saving, sustainable
   transport system with reduced, but still satisfactory, mobility. To
   achieve the vision of resource-efficiency in Europe, a new understanding
   of mobility is needed: ``the mode of travel is the reward of the
   journey{''}, meaning that it is not about travelling fastest and
   frequently, but unhurried (easy-going), infrequently and sustainably. We
   describe a socially inclusive and innovative transport system that could
   achieve this vision and discuss the kinds of policy measures that would
   be required to implement it. Changes are required in many areas
   including values, preferences, infrastructure, technology, governance
   and the economy.}},

Abstract = {{For 3D object localization and tracking with multiple cameras the camera
   poses have to be known within a high precision. The paper evaluates
   camera pose estimation via a fundamental matrix and via the known object
   in environment of multiple static cameras. A special feature point
   extraction technique based on LED (Light Emitting Diodes) point
   detection and matching has been developed for this purpose. LED point
   detection has been solved searching local maximums in images and LED
   point matching has been solved involving patterned time functions for
   each light source. Emitting LEDs have been used as sources of known
   reference points instead of typically used feature point extractors like
   ORB, SIFT, SURF etc. In such a way the robustness of pose estimation has
   been obtained. Camera pose estimation is significant for object
   localization using the networks with multiple cameras which are going to
   an play increasingly important role in modern Smart Cities environments.}},

Title = {{Big data analytics for security intelligence in smart farm}},
Journal = {{ASIA LIFE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{737-750}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Smart farm, a subcategory of smart city, is a multidisciplinary business
   management method, in which agriculture and information communication
   are combined to manage crop growth remotely by automatically measuring
   and analyzing the environment and growth of crops, and controlling and
   constructing a database of an optimal environment on the basis of big
   data. A big data-based decision support system in a smart farm has a
   very close relationship with crop growth, and it is therefore important
   to secure practical information, rather than merely collecting raw data.
   For the system proposed in this paper, as a defense technology for cyber
   target attack threats in smart farm, an intelligent security technology
   is designed through multiple source data collection and analysis on the
   basis of big data analytics, which has recently been drawing attention.
   In the recent internet services, as advanced threats such as APT
   (Advanced Persistent Threats) are increasing, big data analysis is being
   combined with security, all computing environments must be monitored,
   and when a security problem actually occurs, automatic action must be
   taken. The proposed system prevents various attacks in advance by
   applying security intelligence using security intelligence and big data
   analysis and taking appropriate action against a potential security
   threat incident.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Human mobility in a city represents a fascinating complex system that
   combines social interactions, daily constraints and random explorations.
   New collections of data that capture human mobility not only help us to
   understand their underlying patterns but also to design intelligent
   systems. Bringing us the opportunity to reduce traffic and to develop
   other applications that make cities more adaptable to human needs. In
   this paper, we propose an adaptive routing strategy which accounts for
   individual constraints to recommend personalized routes and, at the same
   time, for constraints imposed by the collectivity as a whole. Using big
   data sets recently released during the Telecom Italia Big Data
   Challenge, we show that our algorithm allows us to reduce the overall
   traffic in a smart city thanks to synergetic effects, with the
   participation of individuals in the system, playing a crucial role.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing trend of people leaving digital traces through
   social media. This reality opens new horizons for urban studies. With
   this kind of data, researchers and urban planners can detect many
   aspects of how people live in cities and can also suggest how to
   transform cities into more efficient and smarter places to live in. In
   particular, their digital trails can be used to investigate tastes of
   individuals, and what attracts them to live in a particular city or to
   spend their vacation there. In this paper we propose an unconventional
   way to study how people experience the city, using information from
   geotagged photographs that people take at different locations. We
   compare the spatial behavior of residents and tourists in 10 most
   photographed cities all around the world. The study was conducted on
   both a global and local level. On the global scale we analyze the 10
   most photographed cities and measure how attractive each city is for
   people visiting it from other cities within the same country or from
   abroad. For the purpose of our analysis we construct the users' mobility
   network and measure the strength of the links between each pair of
   cities as a level of attraction of people living in one city (i.e.,
   origin) to the other city (i.e., destination). On the local level we
   study the spatial distribution of user activity and identify the
   photographed hotspots inside each city. The proposed methodology and the
   results of our study are a low cost mean to characterize touristic
   activity within a certain location and can help cities strengthening
   their touristic potential.}},

Abstract = {{The ever-increasing availability of linked open geospatial data provides
   an unprecedented source of geo-information to describe urban
   environments. This wealth of data should be turned into actionable
   knowledge: for example, open data could be used as a proxy or substitute
   for closed or expensive information. The successful employment of linked
   open geospatial data can pave the way for innovative solutions to smart
   city problems. In this paper, we illustrate a set of experiments that,
   starting from linked open geospatial data, execute a knowledge discovery
   process to predict urban semantics. More specifically, we leverage
   geo-information about points of interests as input in a classification
   model of land use at a moderate spatial resolution (250 meters) over
   wide urban areas in Europe. We replicate our experiments in different
   European cities-Milano, Munchen, Barcelona and Brussels-to ensure the
   repeatability and generality of our approach, and we explain the
   experimental conditions, as well as the employed datasets to guarantee
   reproducibility. We extensively report on quantitative and qualitative
   evaluation results, to judge the validity, as well as the limitations of
   our proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce the concept and an implementation of
   geospatial 3D image spaces as new type of native urban models. 3D image
   spaces are based on collections of georeferenced RGB-D imagery. This
   imagery is typically acquired using multi-view stereo mobile mapping
   systems capturing dense sequences of street level imagery. Ideally,
   image depth information is derived using dense image matching. This
   delivers a very dense depth representation and ensures the spatial and
   temporal coherence of radiometric and depth data. This results in a
   high-definition WYSIWYG ({''}what you see is what you get{''}) urban
   model, which is intuitive to interpret and easy to interact with, and
   which provides powerful augmentation and 3D measuring capabilities.
   Furthermore, we present a scalable cloud-based framework for generating
   3D image spaces of entire cities or states and a client architecture for
   their web-based exploitation. The model and the framework strongly
   support the smart city notion of efficiently connecting the urban
   environment and its processes with experts and citizens alike. In the
   paper we particularly investigate quality aspects of the urban model,
   namely the obtainable georeferencing accuracy and the quality of the
   depth map extraction. We show that our image-based georeferencing
   approach is capable of improving the original direct georeferencing
   accuracy by an order of magnitude and that the presented new multi-image
   matching approach is capable of providing high accuracies along with a
   significantly improved completeness of the depth maps.}},

Abstract = {{Benchmarking the performance of local energy systems requires an
   integrated approach. This paper develops a composite index that consists
   of a unique set of 7 dimensions and 35 main indicators. The SDEWES
   (Sustainable Development of Energy, Water, and Environment Systems)
   Index is applied to a sample of 22 Mediterranean port cities. The index
   integrates energy and CO2 emissions data from SEAP (Sustainable Energy
   Action Plans). The values of the indicators are aggregated based on the
   Min-Max method for a final ranking. Nice, Venice, and Dubrovnik are the
   top three cities. An average city in the sample receives a composite
   score of 2.71. The results are subjugated to comparison based on three
   energy scenarios. The scenarios take into account reductions in final
   energy consumption per capita for a given area of the city based on
   smart energy measures. The scenarios represent improvements in the
   energy system that may include combined heat and power based district
   heating networks. A SDEWES Index Tool is developed to further allow
   cities to plan for potential changes in the final ranking based on
   energy scenarios. The SDEWES Index is useful to trigger learning,
   action, and collaboration among Mediterranean port cities to increase
   future performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{3-13}},

Abstract = {{Real-time road traffic monitoring is widely considered to be a promising
   traffic management approach in urban environments. In the smart cities
   scenario, traffic trajectory sensor data streams are constantly produced
   in real time from probe vehicles, which include taxis and buses. By
   exploiting the mass sensor data streams, we can effectively predict and
   prevent traffic jams in a timely manner. However, there are two urgent
   challenges to processing the massive amounts of continuously generated
   trajectory sensor data: (1) the inhomogeneous sparseness in both spatial
   and temporal dimensions that is introduced by probe vehicles moving at
   their own will, and (2) processing stream data in real time manner with
   low latency. In this study, we aim to ameliorate the aforementioned two
   issues. We propose an online approach to addresses the major defect of
   inhomogeneous sparseness, which focuses on employing only real-time data
   rather than mining historical data. Furthermore, we set up a real-time
   system to process trajectory data with low latency. Our tests are
   performed using field test data sets derived from taxis in an urban
   environment; the results show that our proposed method lends validity
   and efficiency advantages for tackling the sparseness, and our real-time
   system is viable for low latency applications such as trafficmonitoring.

Abstract = {{Urban sprawl in South America has for many decades been driven by the
   housing debate, with major impact on overall urban development. The
   impact of uncontrolled expansion has been social, economic and
   environmental degradation to high rates of poverty, poor services and
   transport. The presence of undeveloped areas within suburban landscapes,
   such as former infrastructural facilities, obsolete airports, and
   abandoned train stations, contribute to the impetus to reclaimed and
   revamped land. These spaces also trigger political aspirations for
   implementing better practices on ``smart{''} growth, sustainable
   development and urban regeneration principles. A case in point is the
   former airport `Aeropuerto Cerrillos' in Santiago, Chile, which closed
   in 2001 after years of decay; it intended to replace and host a
   large-scale urban project called `Ciudad Parque Bicentenario'. This
   development is still incomplete and describes a series of pressures on a
   planning system traditionally adjusted to promote expansion confirming
   that urban sprawl is still an open agenda triggered by the presence of
   diverse unexpected urban gaps. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Energy consumption and mobile data cost are two key factors affecting
   users' willingness to participate in mobile crowd-sensing tasks. While
   data-plan (DP) users are mostly concerned with energy consumption,
   non-data-plan (NDP) users are more sensitive to data cost. Traditional
   ways of data uploading in mobile crowdsensing tasks often go to two
   extremes: either in real time or completely offline after the whole task
   is over. In this paper, we propose effSense-an energy-efficient and
   cost-effective data uploading framework, which utilizes adaptive
   uploading schemes within fixed data uploading cycles. In each cycle,
   effSense empowers the participants with a distributed decision making
   scheme to choose the appropriate timing and network to upload data.
   effSense reduces data cost for NDP users by maximally offloading data to
   Bluetooth/WiFi gateways or DP users encountered; it reduces energy
   consumption for DP users by piggybacking data on a call or using more
   energy-efficient networks rather than initiating new 3G connections. By
   leveraging the predictability of users' calls and mobility, effSense
   selects proper uploading strategies for both user types. Our evaluation
   with the MIT reality mining and Nodobo datasets shows that effSense can
   reduce 55\%-65\% energy consumption for DP users, and 48\%-52\% data
   cost for NDP users, respectively, compared to traditional uploading
   schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: For a new district in the Dutch city Meppel, a hybrid energy
   concept is developed based on bio-gas co-generation. The generated
   electricity is used to power domestic heat pumps which supply thermal
   energy for domestic hot water and space heating demand of households. In
   this paper, we investigate direct control of the heat pumps by the
   utility and how the large-scale optimization problem that is created can
   be reduced significantly.
   Methods: Two different linear programming control methods (global MILP
   and time scale MILP) are presented. The latter solves large-scale
   optimization problems in considerably less computational time. For
   simulation purposes, data of household thermal demand is obtained from
   prediction models developed for this research. The control methods are
   compared with a reference control method resembling PI on/off control of
   each heat pump.
   Results: The reference control results in a dynamic electricity
   consumption with many peak loads on the network, which indicates a high
   level of simultaneous running heat pumps at those times. Both methods of
   mix integer linear programming (MILP) control of the heat pumps lead to
   a much improved, almost flat electricity consumption profile.
   Conclusions: Both optimization control methods are equally able to
   minimize the maximum peak consumption of electric power by the heat
   pumps, but the time scale MILP method requires much less computational
   effort. Future work is dedicated on further development of optimized
   control of the heat pumps and the central CHP.}},

Abstract = {{Graph databases are taking place in many different applications: smart
   city, smart cloud, smart education, etc. In most cases, the applications
   imply the creation of ontologies and the integration of a large set of
   knowledge to build a knowledge base as an RDF KB store, with ontologies,
   static data, historical data and real time data. Most of the RDF stores
   are endowed with inferential engines that materialize some knowledge as
   triples during indexing or querying. In these cases, deleting concepts
   may imply the removal and change of many triples, especially if the
   triples are those modeling the ontological part of the knowledge base,
   or are referred by many other concepts. For these solutions, the graph
   database versioning feature is not provided at level of the RDF stores
   tool, and it is quite complex and time consuming to be addressed as
   black box approach. In most cases the indexing is a time consuming
   process, and the rebuilding of the KB may imply manually edited long
   scripts that are error prone. Therefore, in order to solve these kinds
   of problems, this paper proposes a lifecycle methodology and a tool
   supporting versioning of indexes for RDF KB store. The solution proposed
   has been developed on the basis of a number of knowledge oriented
   projects as Sii-Mobility (smart city), RESOLUTE (smart city risk
   assessment), ICARO (smart cloud). Results are reported in terms of time
   saving and reliability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we continue our previous research on the development of
   the current model of higher education, which pointed out that the labor
   market is looking for people with competencies and skills reflecting a
   T-shape model. As a consequence, universities should include a wider mix
   of disciplines in the curricula of their courses. Hence, to overcome
   existing criticisms and to provide some suggestions on how to enhance
   universities' performances, we thought of education as a process with
   inputs, outputs, and relevant dependencies. We called such a university
   a ``smarter university{''} in which knowledge is a common heritage of
   teachers and students. In our research the smarter university model is
   based on a smart-city-like model, due to the fact that next generation
   networks and relevant services are going to be more and more integrated
   with existing infrastructure and information management systems. Thus,
   it is mandatory that smart solutions are the most prominent assets of
   modern university environments to improve the effectiveness of higher
   education. In this paper, we report the experimental results from a
   specific case study of collaboration between industry and university,
   which could be used as a reference for the definition of patterns to be
   applied in the redesign of the current education systems, even though
   the experiment refers to a technological application scenario. (C) 2015

   functions, instead of large-scale physical movement is crucial; and (b)
   efficient public transportation systems would assist in developing smart

Abstract = {{Harvesting low-density ambient microwave power as an alternative power
   source for small ubiquitous wireless nodes has been proposed in recent
   papers discussing emerging technologies like the Internet of Things and
   Smart Cities. However, a literature review of the state-of-the-art
   Schottky diode based microwave rectifiers shows that a maximum
   efficiency has been reached for such devices operating in the low-power
   regime, as is the case for ambient microwave power-harvesters. This work
   examines the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for this
   RF-to-dc power conversion efficiency limitation, and explores a high I-V
   curvature backward tunnel diode to overcome this efficiency limitation.
   Measurements of the 2.4 GHz RF-to-dc power conversion efficiency at -40
   dBm input power demonstrates that the backward tunnel diode outperforms
   the HSMS-285B Schottky diode by a factor of 10.5 and the Skyworks
   SMS7630 by a factor of 5.5 in a lossless matching network scenario. A
   prototype built using a new GSG probe embedded with a matching circuit
   showed a total power conversion efficiency of 3.8\% for -40 dBm input
   power and 18.2\% for -30 dBm input power at 2.35 GHz.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Substantial variability of household energy consumption is essential to
   recognize. In particular the variability occurs towards large
   magnitudes. This work focuses on modeling the distribution of household
   annual energy consumptions and promoting a practical modeling framework
   resulting to explicit models. Lognormal distributions describe well
   energy consumption of households that do not use electricity for
   heating. We model at city district level how consumption distributions
   depend on district housing characteristics. At individual household
   level, the joint distribution of the annual electricity consumption and
   key household characteristic (number of persons, floor area, number of
   bedrooms), is well approximated by multivariate lognormal distributions.
   This work utilizes numerous data sources: household annual electricity
   consumption data for city districts, city summary data on housing and
   people, data on sold apartments, and Irish Automatic Meter Reading (AMR)
   data with test survey information. We also demonstrate a process for
   adjusting the models when data relating individual household energy
   consumption with other characteristics are not available. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{One of the basis of the development in future intelligent transportation
   systems is the vehicle itself, whose provided features and communication
   possibilities are continuously expanding. One of the main areas in
   development of the vehicle of the future is mechatronics. Teaching this
   topic is a complex challenge because of the multidisciplinary nature of
   the topic. On the other hand, the requirements of the smart city or the
   smart mobility of the future demand complex solutions from next
   generation of engineers. The topics include electrical, mechanical
   engineering, control theory, and information and communications
   technology, in which fields the students must deepen their knowledge.
   Tasks and solving problems in mechatronics require cognitive and
   operational knowledge and practical experience in systems design and
   analysis. There is a strong demand for project-based teaching using
   certain kinds of practical material. This paper presents two educational
   frameworks designed for students with a specialization in vehicle

Abstract = {{A new model is established to obtain the building energy with a gradual
   change process of VO2 optical properties. Based on this method, three
   types of existing VO2 films are employed to simulate the heating and
   cooling energy consumptions in five typical Chinese cities. The results
   show that the smart characteristic is not evident in VO2 glasses because
   these films are almost in the cold state or cold transition state in the
   entire year. To improve this situation, the concept of an ideal
   thermochromic intelligent glass is put forward. Unexpectedly, the level
   of energy consumption increases with the film phase transition
   temperature decreasing in the heating period. However, the energy-saving
   effects will be effectively improved both in the cooling and heating
   periods when the phase transition process interval is shortened. The
   cooling energy consumptions for the ideal glass decrease by at most
   81.7\% and 70.5\% compared with white glass and Low-E glass,
   respectively. In the heating period, the level of energy consumption for
   the ideal glass is better than Low-E glass. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The recent development of low cost wireless sensors enables novel
   internet-of-things (IoT) applications, such as the monitoring of water
   distribution networks. In such scenarios, the lifetime of the wireless
   sensor network (WSN) is a major concern, given that sensor node
   replacement is generally inconvenient and costly. In this paper, a
   compressive sensing-based scheduling scheme is proposed that conserves
   energy by activating only a small subset of sensor nodes in each
   timeslot to sense and transmit. Compressive sensing introduces a
   cardinality constraint that makes the scheduling optimization problem
   particularly challenging. Taking advantage of the network topology
   imposed by the IoT water monitoring scenario, the scheduling problem is
   decomposed into simpler subproblems, and a dynamic-programming-based
   solution method is proposed. Based on the proposed method, a solution
   algorithm is derived, whose complexity and energy-wise performance are
   investigated. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is characterized
   and its performance is evaluated numerically via an IoT emulator of
   water distribution networks. The analytical and numerical results show
   that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in
   terms of energy consumption, network lifetime, and robustness to sensor
   node failures. It is argued that the derived solution approach is
   general and it can be potentially applied to more IoT scenarios such as
   WSN scheduling in smart cities and intelligent transport systems.}},

Abstract = {{Computer vision technologies can contribute in many ways to the
   development of smart cities. In the case of vision applications for
   advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), they can help to increase
   road traffic safety, which is a major concern nowadays. The design of an
   embedded vision system for driver assistance is not straightforward;
   several requirements must be addressed such as computational
   performance, cost, size, power consumption or time-to-market. This paper
   presents a novel reconfigurable embedded vision system that meets the
   requirements of ADAS applications. The developed PCB board contains a
   System on Chip composed of a programmable logic that supports parallel
   processing necessary for a fast pixel-level analysis, and a
   microprocessor suited for serial decision making. A lane departure
   warning system was implemented in the case study, obtaining a better
   computational performance than the rest of the works found in the
   literature. Moreover, thanks to the reconfiguration capability of the
   proposed system a more flexible and extensible solution is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{A smart lighting system provides automatic control of lighting
   illumination and color temperature for high quality of life as well as
   energy savings in smart cities. A real-time activity understanding
   system with accurate human location estimation under varying
   illumination is required for smart lighting control, since comfortable
   lighting conditions vary according to human activities. This paper
   presents a real-time smart lighting control system using human location
   estimation based on inverse-perspective mapping of depth map images and
   activity estimation from location, heading direction, and height
   estimation of the moving person from multiple depth cameras. Lighting
   control based on estimated proximity to the specific activity area,
   distance to the target lighting area, and heading direction of the
   person provides an automatic activity-dependent lighting environment as
   well as energy savings. We implemented several activity modes such as
   study mode, dialog mode, and watching TV mode, and applied the proposed
   lighting control system to a living room lighting control with known
   furniture, electronics, and lighting locations using multiple Kinect
   depth cameras. The proposed model is based on localized proximity-based
   lighting control and can be extended to a more general lighting control
   by combining with global lighting control schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization in India is neither unique nor exclusive, but is similar to
   a worldwide phenomenon and has led to the development of urban sprawl,
   as it has elsewhere in the world. In the context of rapidly evolving
   policy frameworks in India, this article assesses the extent to which
   urban planning policies address sprawl. Local development plans of 53
   cities across India are analyzed using content analysis and grounded
   theory. The study reveals that cities in India are not completely
   embracing smart-growth strategies in their development plans, and the
   use of smart-growth strategies differs among highly populated
   metropolitan cities versus less-populated cities. The study identified
   that four barriers conventional urban planning mindset, lack of
   incentive-based practices and resources, ad-hoc planning, and lack of
   integrated land use transportation and environmental planning impede
   smart-growth strategies in India. Furthermore, the results reveal a
   theory of planning action, which urban planners may tend to incorporate
   in their early stages of planning steps to address sprawl before they

Volume = {{47}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a GIS-based land-use diversity measure for
   residential neighbourhoods - the land-use diversity index (or LDI) model
   - as a possible urban sustainability criterion. The term land-use
   diversity' is proposed as representative of many physical attributes of
   neighbourhood form opposite to typical sprawl patterns. A diverse
   neighbourhood is one with a mixture of compatible land uses and housing
   types, containing an array of amenities in reasonable proximity to where
   people live. The prototype version of the LDI model incorporates 34
   input variables, structured around four sub-indices. Its range of
   expected values are explored through four case study applications.
   Theoretically, index values can vary between 0 and 1, where 1 represents
   a condition of greater land-use diversity'. The two traditional urban
   neighbourhoods fared well (index values ranging between 0.627 and 0.726)
   because they have a greater range of land uses and neighbourhood
   amenities, a better integration of housing types and are more
   concentrated. These two neighbourhoods meet many of the exuberant
   diversity' criteria described by Jacobs. The two suburban neighbourhoods
   scored lower index values (between 0.250 and 0.363), indicating
   variables different to those for traditional urban forms. The LDI model
   differs from existing sprawl measures fundamentally, as it attempts to
   measure sprawl at a finer resolution (i.e. at the neighbourhood scale).
   It is anticipated the LDI model will assist with planning new, and
   reconfiguring old, neighbourhoods as they strive to meet smart growth
   criteria now being considered by many cities.}},

Abstract = {{Waste Management (WM) represents an important part of Smart Cities (SCs)
   with significant impact on modern societies. WM involves a set of
   processes ranging from waste collection to the recycling of the
   collected materials. The proliferation of sensors and actuators enable
   the new era of Internet of Things (IoT) that can be adopted in SCs and
   help in WM. Novel approaches that involve dynamic routing models
   combined with the IoT capabilities could provide solutions that
   outperform existing models. In this paper, we focus on a Sc where a
   number of collection bins are located in different areas with sensors
   attached to them. We study a dynamic waste collection architecture,
   which is based on data retrieved by sensors. We pay special attention to
   the possibility of immediate WM service in high priority areas, e.g.,
   schools or hospitals where, possibly, the presence of dangerous waste or
   the negative effects on human quality of living impose the need for
   immediate collection. This is very crucial when we focus on sensitive
   groups of citizens like pupils, elderly or people living close to areas
   where dangerous waste is rejected. We propose novel algorithms aiming at
   providing efficient and scalable solutions to the dynamic waste
   collection problem through the management of the trade-off between the
   immediate collection and its cost. We describe how the proposed system
   effectively responds to the demand as realized by sensor observations
   and alerts originated in high priority areas. Our aim is to minimize the
   time required for serving high priority areas while keeping the average
   expected performance at high level. Comprehensive simulations on top of
   the data retrieved by a SC validate the proposed algorithms on both
   quantitative and qualitative criteria which are adopted to analyze their

Abstract = {{Emergence of context-aware technologies and IoT devices reflect that the
   quality of a human life has become one of the most essential aspects in
   Smart Cities. With this goal health monitoring of elderly and disabled
   people have got plenty of attention and focus in the research. The
   healthcare systems rely on the components responsible for context
   sensing, processing, storage and inference, and response. In order to
   make the interoperability among the various healthcare systems, a
   typical standard is needed in order to uniformly access the
   context-aware healthcare information coming through a fundamental
   infrastructure. In this paper, we propose people-centric sensing
   framework for the healthcare of elderly and disabled people. Such
   platform is aimed to monitor health of the elderly and disabled person
   and provide them with a service oriented emergency response in case of
   abnormal health condition. We focus on three aspects: (a) context
   manipulation from the mobile device in people-centric environment; (b)
   emergency response using context base information; and (c) modeling
   mobile context sources as services. The most distinctive feature of
   current work is that medical resources are efficiently used to provide
   them real-time medical services in case of emergency simultaneously
   extending social network of the elderly people. The system
   implementation shows that the proposed people-centric sensing system is
   efficient and cost-effective in health and emergency care. (c) 2015

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The recent huge availability of data coming from mobile phones, social
   networks and urban sensors leads research scientists to new
   opportunities and challenges. For example, mining micro-blogs content to
   unveil latent information about people sentiment and opinions is drawing
   more and more attention, since it can improve the understanding of
   complex phenomena and paves the way to the development of new innovative
   and intelligent services.
   In this paper we present CrowdPulse, a domain-agnostic framework for
   text analytics of social streams. The framework extracts textual data
   from social networks and implements algorithms for semantic processing,
   sentiment analysis and classification of gathered data. The framework
   has been deployed in two real-world scenarios in order to identify the
   most at-risk areas of the Italian territory according to the content
   posted on social networks and to monitor the recovering state of the
   social capital of L'Aquila's city after the dreadful earthquake of April
   2009(1), respectively.
   In both scenarios, the framework showed its effectiveness and confirmed
   the insight that the combination of technologies specifically designed
   for Big Data processing with state-of-the-art methodologies for semantic
   analysis of textual content can provide very interesting findings and
   permits the analysis of such phenomena in a totally new way. (C) 2015

Title = {{Trust-Enhanced Cloud Service Selection Model Based on QoS Analysis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Cloud computing technology plays a very important role in many areas,
   such as in the construction and development of the smart city.
   Meanwhile, numerous cloud services appear on the cloud-based platform.
   Therefore how to how to select trustworthy cloud services remains a
   significant problem in such platforms, and extensively investigated
   owing to the ever-growing needs of users. However, trust relationship in
   social network has not been taken into account in existing methods of
   cloud service selection and recommendation. In this paper, we propose a
   cloud service selection model based on the trust-enhanced similarity.
   Firstly, the direct, indirect, and hybrid trust degrees are measured
   based on the interaction frequencies among users. Secondly, we estimate
   the overall similarity by combining the experience usability measured
   based on Jaccard's Coefficient and the numerical distance computed by
   Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Then through using the trust degree to
   modify the basic similarity, we obtain a trust-enhanced similarity.
   Finally, we utilize the trust-enhanced similarity to find similar
   trusted neighbors and predict the missing QoS values as the basis of
   cloud service selection and recommendation. The experimental results
   show that our approach is able to obtain optimal results via adjusting
   parameters and exhibits high effectiveness. The cloud services ranking
   by our model also have better QoS properties than other methods in the
   comparison experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In the regeneration of Chinese migrant communities, which are usually
   referred to as ``villages in the city,{''} various modes of governance
   have been formed based on the relationships between the three key actors
   (state, market, and society). These modes of governance are
   characterized by problems ranging from a lack of a transparent planning
   process, to ineffective collective decision-making. Rural migrants also
   play only a marginal role, or no role at all, in the regeneration
   practices, resulting in actual and potential social conflicts and
   inequality. This article contributes to current debates on social
   sustainability by presenting smart governance for the engagement of
   marginal migrants and other marginal social groups, and the
   establishment of an equitable relationship between the three key actors
   in the regeneration process. It firstly analyzes issues and problems of
   existing modes of governance in the regeneration of Chinese migrant
   communities. It then sheds light on the further exploration and
   application of new types of web-based Planning Support Systems, which
   can be developed based on SoftGIS methodology and easily used in social
   media on smartphones, in formulating smart governance. This article
   finally presents a framework on smart governance and social
   sustainability for migrant communities in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A Smart City relies on six key factors: Smart Governance, Smart People,
   Smart Economy, Smart Environment, Smart Living and Smart Mobility. This
   paper focuses on Smart Mobility by improving one of its key components:
   positioning. We developed and deployed a novel indoor positioning system
   (IPS) that is combined with an outdoor positioning system to support
   seamless indoor and outdoor navigation and wayfinding. The positioning
   system is implemented as a service in our broader cartography-based
   smart university platform, called SmartUJI, which centralizes access to
   a diverse collection of campus information and provides basic and
   complex services for the Universitat Jaume I (Spain), which serves as
   surrogate of a small city. Using our IPS and based on the SmartUJI
   services, we developed, deployed and evaluated two end-user mobile
   applications: the SmartUJI APP that allows users to obtain map-based
   information about the different facilities of the campus, and the
   SmartUJI AR that allows users to interact with the campus through an
   augmented reality interface. Students, university staff and visitors who
   tested the applications reported their usefulness in locating university
   facilities and generally improving spatial orientation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a methodology for using mobile telephone-based
   sensor data for detecting spatial and temporal differences in everyday
   activities in cities. Mobile telephone-based sensor data has great
   applicability in developing urban monitoring tools and smart city
   solutions. The paper outlines methods for delineating indicator points
   of temporal events referenced as midnight', morning start', midday', and
   duration of day', which represent the mobile telephone usage of
   residents (what we call social time) rather than solar or standard time.
   Density maps by time quartiles were also utilized to test the
   versatility of this methodology and to analyze the spatial differences
   in cities. The methodology was tested with data from cities of Harbin
   (China), Paris (France), and Tallinn (Estonia). Results show that the
   developed methods have potential for measuring the distribution of
   temporal activities in cities and monitoring urban changes with
   georeferenced mobile phone data.}},

Abstract = {{This article draws on Margaret Radin's theorization of contested
   commodities' to explore the process whereby informal housing becomes
   formalized while also being shaped by legal regulation. In seeking to
   move once-informal housing into the domain of official legality, cities
   can seldom rely on a simple legal framework of private-law principles of
   property and contract. Instead, they face complex trade-offs between
   providing basic needs and affordability and meeting public-law norms
   around living standards, traditional neighbourhood feel and the
   environment. This article highlights these issues through an examination
   of the uneven process of legal formalization of basement apartments in
   Vancouver, Canada. We chose a lengthy periodfrom 1928 to 2009to explore
   how basement apartments became a vital source of housing often at odds
   with city planning that has long favoured a low-density residential
   built form. We suggest that Radin's theoretical account makes it
   possible to link legalization and official market construction with two
   questions: whether to permit commodification and how to permit
   commodification. Real-world commodification processesincluding legal
   sanctionreflect hybridization, pragmatic decision making and regulatory
   compromise. The resolution of questions concerning how to legalize
   commodification are also intertwined with processes of market expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Cities are the most dramatic manifestations of human activities on the
   surface of the earth. These human-dominated organisms-i.e.,
   cities-degrade natural habitats, simplify species composition, disrupt
   hydrological systems, and modify energy flow and nutrient cycling.
   Today, these consequential impacts of human activities, originated from
   population increase, rapid urbanization, high private motor vehicle
   dependency, deregulated industrialization and mass livestock production,
   are increasing exponentially and causing great deal of environmental,
   social, and economic challenges both at global and local scales. In such
   a situation, establishment of sustainable cities, through sustainable
   urban development practices, is seen as a potential panacea to combat
   these challenges responsibly, effectively, and efficiently. This paper
   offers a critical review of the key literature on the issues relating to
   planning, development and management of sustainable cities, introduces
   the contributions from the Special Issue, and speculates on the
   prospective research directions to place necessary mechanisms to secure
   a sustainable urban future for all.}},

Abstract = {{The sustainability strategy in urban spaces arises from reflecting on
   how to achieve a more habitable city and is materialized in a series of
   sustainable transformations aimed at humanizing different environments
   so that they can be used and enjoyed by everyone without exception and
   regardless of their ability. Modern communication technologies allow new
   opportunities to analyze efficiency in the use of urban spaces from
   several points of view: adequacy of facilities, usability, and social
   integration capabilities. The research presented in this paper proposes
   a method to perform an analysis of movement accessibility in sustainable
   cities based on radio frequency technologies and the ubiquitous
   computing possibilities of the new Internet of Things paradigm. The
   proposal can be deployed in both indoor and outdoor environments to
   check specific locations of a city. Finally, a case study in a
   controlled context has been simulated to validate the proposal as a
   pre-deployment step in urban environments.}},

Abstract = {{Concurrent with global economic development in the last 50 years, the
   opportunities for the spread of existing diseases and emergence of new
   infectious pathogens, have increased substantially. The activities
   associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have
   resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn
   provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more
   effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called
   Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things
   which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors,
   interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit
   its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take
   advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart
   from the development of hardware technologies and
   networking/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop
   appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for
   analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information
   systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop
   distributed file systems. While the development in analytical
   methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important
   advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and
   temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges
   from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there
   used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of
   methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged
   discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented
   by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using
   novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously
   recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical
   approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust
   and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression
   approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal
   data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater
   acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from
   diverse sources including published scientific information and expert
   opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The
   opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of
   animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but
   not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency,
   of biases associated with these data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A converged optical access network system is proposed to provide
   reliable transmission for both communication data and energy management
   data. The convergence is carried out by a novel multifunction and
   low-cost fault-monitoring scheme in passive optical network systems. The
   scheme enables monitoring the occurrence of damages to distribution
   fibers, identifying the status of ONUs, localizing damaged fibers, and
   transferring smart meter data over the fault-monitoring channel. The use
   of a simple tone detection technique can help the recognition of a fiber
   break among distribution fibers and activation of the smart meter data
   transmission. Transmission of smart metering data over the
   fault-monitoring channel with a 10 Mb/s data rate is demonstrated. Both
   the added tone detection and upstream smart meter data transmission have
   a relatively large loss budget and will not affect the design of the
   original optical access networks.}},

Title = {{Assessment of antenna characteristic effects on pedestrian and cyclists
   travel-time estimation based on Bluetooth and WiFi MAC addresses}},

Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{124-141}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring pedestrian and cyclists movement is an important area of
   research in transport, crowd safety, urban design and human behaviour
   assessment areas. Media Access Control (MAC) address data has been
   recently used as potential information for extracting features from
   people's movement. MAC addresses are unique identifiers of WiFi and
   Bluetooth wireless technologies in smart electronics devices such as
   mobile phones, laptops and tablets. The unique number of each WiFi and
   Bluetooth MAC address can be captured and stored by MAC address
   scanners. MAC addresses data in fact allows for unannounced,
   non-participatory, and tracking of people. The use of MAC data for
   tracking people has been focused recently for applying in mass events,
   shopping centres, airports, train stations, etc. In terms of travel time
   estimation, setting up a scanner with a big value of antenna's gain is
   usually recommended for highways and main roads to track vehicle's
   movements, whereas big gains can have some drawbacks in case of
   pedestrian and cyclists. Pedestrian and cyclists mainly move in built
   distinctions and city pathways where there is significant noises from
   other fixed WiFi and Bluetooth. Big antenna's gains will cover wide
   areas that results in scanning more samples from pedestrians and
   cyclists' MAC device. However, anomalies (such fixed devices) may be
   captured that increase the complexity and processing time of data
   analysis. On the other hand, small gain antennas will have lesser
   anomalies in the data but at the cost of lower overall sample size of
   pedestrian and cyclist's data. This paper studies the effect of antenna
   characteristics on MAC address data in terms of travel-time estimation
   for pedestrians and cyclists. The results of the empirical case study
   compare the effects of small and big antenna gains in order to suggest
   optimal set up for increasing the accuracy of pedestrians and cyclists'
   travel-time estimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The automotive industry is witnessing a revolution with the advent of
   advanced vehicular technologies, smart vehicle options, and fuel
   alternatives. However, there is very limited research on consumer
   preferences for such advanced vehicular technologies. The deployment and
   penetration of advanced vehicular technologies in the marketplace, and
   planning for possible market adoption scenarios, calls for the
   collection and analysis of consumer preference data related to these
   emerging technologies. This study aims to address this need, offering a
   detailed analysis of consumer preference for alternative fuel types and
   technology options using data collected in stated choice experiments
   conducted on a sample of consumers from six metropolitan cities in South
   Korea. The results indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in
   consumer preferences for various smart technology options such as
   wireless internet, vehicle connectivity, and voice command features, but
   relatively less heterogeneity in the preference for smart vehicle
   applications such as real-time traveler information on parking and
   traffic conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{22-31}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Solid waste is a major urban challenge worldwide and reclaiming the
   resources embedded in waste streams, involving organized recyclers, is a
   smart response to it. Informal and organized recyclers, mostly in the
   global south, already act as important urban miners in resource
   recovery. The paper describes the complex operations of recycling
   cooperatives and draws attention to their economic, environmental, and
   social contributions. A detailed discussion based on empirical data from
   the recycling network COOPCENT-ABC in metropolitan Sao Paulo, Brazil,
   contextualizes this form of urban mining. The analysis is situated
   within Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) and Ecological Economy (EE)
   theory. Current challenges related to planning, public policy, and the
   implementation of cooperative recycling are analysed on the level of
   individual recyclers, cooperatives, municipalities and internationally.
   There are still many hurdles for the informal, organized recycling
   sector to become recognized as a key player in efficient material
   separation and to up-scale these activities for an effective
   contribution to the SSE and EE. Policies need to be in place to
   guarantee fair and safe work relations. There is a win-win situation
   where communities and the environment will benefit from organized urban
   mining. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a centralized electric vehicles (EVs) recharge
   scheduling system for parking lots using a realistic vehicular
   mobility/parking pattern focusing on individual parking lots. We
   consider two different types of EV based on their mobility/parking
   patterns: 1) regular EVs; and 2) irregular EVs. An extensive trace-based
   vehicular mobility model collected from the Canton of Zurich is used for
   the regular EVs, and a probabilistic pattern built on top of this trace
   is used for modeling the behavior of irregular EVs. To the extent of our
   knowledge, this is the first EV charging scheduling study in the
   literature that takes into account a realistic vehicular mobility
   pattern focusing on individual parking lots. We compare the performance
   of our proposed system with two well-known basic scheduling mechanisms,
   first come first serve and earliest deadline first, with regard to two
   objective functions: 1) maximizing the total parking lot revenue; and 2)
   maximizing the total number of EVs fulfilling their requirements.
   Comparison results show that our proposed system outperforms well-known
   basic scheduling mechanisms with regards to both objectives. Parking
   lots managing the recharging of a high number of EVs will greatly
   benefit from using such recharge scheduling systems in the context of
   smart cities.}},

Abstract = {{Modern cities contain a wealth of information that is usually scattered
   among a myriad of organisms. For citizens it is many times difficult and
   confusing to access this information. Cities must find a way to put all
   this information at the disposal not only of the citizens but any
   employee that takes part in the operation and maintenance of the city.
   One of the problems that appear is that each city department has
   organized its information independently of others, thus leading to an
   heterogeneous ecosystem of databases and platforms. This paper describes
   a solution to access all the information available in a city through a
   mobile platform and a brief description on problems and solutions in the
   process of porting the application to web and SmartTV platforms. A
   customizable user application for the Android operating system is
   described. The solution can be deployed in any city as the application
   dynamically obtains the information from remote servers that hold access
   to the databases.}},

Journal = {{CITIES}},

Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{66-75}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cities around the world are under pressure from population growth,
   frenetic global economic restructuring, and climatic perturbations.
   Some, like London, attract an excess of speculative, momentum or
   tax-informed inward investment to finance their intensification.
   Provincial towns, on the other hand, which sustain extractive
   metropolii, can wither without capital or talent. Sensible planning and
   calibrated regional investment is the antidote to polarisation but
   confronts an apparent `smart' or `sustainable' conundrum. Grandiose,
   technical megaprojects like Songdo or Masdar cities and sprawling,
   disconnected estates are an anathema. We articulate a putative smart and
   sustainable solution ('smart-SUR') with `institutional', `project' and
   innovative `funding' components and explore mega-urban regeneration
   projects in the UK and Holland. Smart-SUR has geographical, procedural
   and teleological aspects. Its mechanism involves local engagement,
   institutional strengthening, tight project screening and innovative
   regenerative funding. Its outcome are inclusive, measured, and
   coordinated transformations which `sweat' existing assets, counter the
   long-tail of educational failure, and catalyse productive local
   innovation. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{State smart growth programmes (SGPs) attempt to alter local sprawling
   development patterns through incentives encouraging local governments to
   apply smart growth policies. This incentive approach makes applications
   of smart growth policies rely mainly on local government decisions to
   adopt such policies. Little research investigated elected officials'
   familiarity with smart growth policies, especially in small
   cities/towns. This research paper compares elected officials'
   familiarity with smart growth policies across small cities/towns that
   are located in the US eastern states with and without SGPs. Based on
   data collected from a mail survey sent to elected officials in 481 small
   cities/towns, the researcher conducted bivariate and regression analyses
   to assess elected officials' familiarity and investigate effects of
   adopting statewide SGPs on that familiarity. The survey shows that most
   elected officials are familiar with the term smart growth in general,
   but their familiarity with smart growth policies varies across
   cities/towns. Also, the regression analysis explains familiarity by the
   state adoption of SGPs, and city/town population and regional context
   (urban/rural). Research findings point to needs to design outreach
   educational programmes to improve officials' familiarity with the wide
   range of smart growth policies, especially in non-coastal cities/towns
   and rural regions.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},

Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{9-25}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The residential sector represents some 30\% of global electricity
   consumption but the underlying composition and drivers are still only
   poorly understood. The drivers are many, varied, and complex, including
   local climate, household demographics, household behaviour, building
   stock and the type and number of appliances. There is considerable
   variation across households and, until recently, often a lack of good
   data. This study draws upon a detailed household dataset from the
   Australian Smart Grid Smart City project to build a household
   electricity consumption model. A statistical linear regression model for
   household energy demand was established and tested for both individual
   households and regional aggregations of households. The model showed
   only reasonable performance in forecasting the consumption of individual
   households - highlighting the influence of factors beyond those surveyed
   - but good performance for aggregated household consumption. Models such
   as this would seem highly useful for a range of stakeholders including
   individual households trying to understand the potential implications of
   different choices, utilities looking to better forecast the impact of
   different possible residential trends and policy makers seeking to
   assist households in improving their energy efficiency through targeted
   policies and programs. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{We aim to reduce the social cost of congestion in many smart city

   introducing a non-trivial amount of uncertainty in the signals, we
   reduce the social cost of congestion, i.e., improve social welfare. The
   signalling schemes are efficient in terms of both communication and
   computation, and are consistent with past observations of the
   congestion. Moreover, the resulting population dynamics converge under

Abstract = {{Owing to the recent development of sensor resolutions onboard different
   Earth observation platforms, remote sensing is an important source of
   information for mapping and monitoring natural and man-made land covers.
   Of particular importance is the increasing amounts of available
   hyperspectral data originating from airborne and satellite sensors such
   as AVIRIS, HyMap, and Hyperion with very high spectral resolution (i.e.,
   high number of spectral channels) containing rich information for a wide
   range of applications. A relevant example is the separation of different
   types of land-cover classes using the data in order to understand, e.g.,
   impacts of natural disasters or changing of city buildings over time.
   More recently, such increases in the data volume, velocity, and variety
   of data contributed to the term big data that stand for challenges
   shared with many other scientific disciplines. On one hand, the amount
   of available data is increasing in a way that raises the demand for
   automatic data analysis elements since many of the available data
   collections are massively underutilized lacking experts for manual
   investigation. On the other hand, proven statistical methods (e.g.,
   dimensionality reduction) driven by manual approaches have a significant
   impact in reducing the amount of big data toward smaller smart data
   contributing to the more recently used terms data value and veracity
   (i.e., less noise, lower dimensions that capture the most important
   information). This paper aims to take stock of which proven statistical
   data mining methods in remote sensing are used to contribute to smart
   data analysis processes in the light of possible automation as well as
   scalable and parallel processing techniques. We focus on parallel
   support vector machines (SVMs) as one of the best out-of-the-box
   classification methods.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to highlight the usefulness of big data
   analytics to support smart destinations by studying the online image of
   Barcelona (a leading smart city and tourist destination) as transmitted
   via social media through the analysis of more than 100,000 relevant
   travel blogs and online travel reviews (OTRs) written in English by
   tourists who have visited the city in the last 10 years. The proposed
   methodology used in this paper facilitates the massive gathering,
   cleaning up, and analysis of tourism-related user-generated content
   (UGC) from the most suitable sources, and helps to define the
   transmitted image of the city through collecting and processing large
   volumes of digital data. It is also used to extract business
   intelligence (BI) from OTRs concerning visits to Barcelona's main
   landmark/attraction, La Sagrada Familia. The findings of this massive
   content analysis of information from a trustworthy source, UGC data, is
   very useful in appling BI to destination management, both in order to
   develop and assess marketing strategies and to improve branding and
   positioning policies among tourism and marketing organizations. It
   reinforces the ability of cities such as Barcelona to develop a smart
   city and destination concept, as well as a strategy for themselves. (C)

Abstract = {{The provision of an adequate network of urban infrastructures is
   essential to create clean and energy-efficient urban mobility systems.
   However, the urban infrastructure to support sustainable mobility can
   produce a substantial environmental burden if no life cycle
   environmental criteria are applied in its design and management. This
   paper demonstrates the potential to support energy-efficient and
   CO2-free pedestrian and electric bike (e-bike) mobility through the
   ecological design (eco-design) of urban elements. An eco-design approach
   is applied to reconceptualize a conventional pergola toward an
   eco-product (solar pergola). The solar pergola generates surplus
   photovoltaic electricity that provides a multifunctional character.
   According to the end-use of this energy, different scenarios are
   analyzed for robust decision-making.
   The deployment of solar pergolas can contribute to save from 2,080 kg to
   over 47,185 kg of CO2 eq. and from 350,390 MJ to over 692,760 MJ eq. in
   10 years, depending on the geographic emplacement (solar radiation and
   electricity grid system). These savings are equivalent to charging 2-9
   e-bikes per day using clean energy.
   Instead of maximizing infrastructure deployment to shift to
   environmentally friendly modes of mobility, the implementation of
   multifunctional urban elements represents a key area of action in the
   context of smart city development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The Multifunctional Environmental Energy Tower: Carbon Footprint and

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{13564-13584}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The Multifunctional Environmental Energy Tower (MEET) is a single,
   vertical, stand-alone renewable energy plant designed to decrease the
   primary energy consumption from fossil fuels, to reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions, to maximize the energy production from renewable sources
   available in place and to minimize land use. A feasibility case study
   was performed for the city of Rome, Italy. Several technologies are
   exploited and integrated in a single system, including a photovoltaic
   plant, a geothermal plant and a biomass digester for urban organic waste
   and sewage sludge. In the proposed configuration, the MEET could cover
   more than 11\% of the electric power demand and up to 3\% of the space
   heating demand of the surrounding urban area. An LCA analysis evaluates
   the environmental impact in a cradle-to-grave approach for two impact
   categories: global warming (carbon footprint) and land use (land
   occupation and land transformation). The functional unit is a mix of
   electric (49.1\%) and thermal (50.9\%) energy (kWh(mix)). The carbon
   footprint is 48.70 g CO2eq/kWh(mix); the land transformation is 4.058
   m(2)/GWh(mix); and the land occupation is 969.3 m(2)y/GWh(mix). With
   respect to other energy production technologies, the carbon footprint is
   lower and similar to the best-performing ones (e.g., co-generation from
   wood chips); both of the land use indicators are considerably smaller
   than the least-impacting technologies. A systematic study was finally
   performed, and possible optimizations of the original design are
   proposed. Thanks to the modular design, the conceptual idea can be
   easily applied to other urban and non-urban scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The smart and resilient city evolves by slow procedures of mutation
   without radical changes, increasing the livability of its territory. The
   value of the city center in a Smart City can increase through urban
   lighting systems: its elements on the territory can collect and convey
   data to increase services to city users; the electrical system becomes
   the so-called Smart Grid. This paper presents a study of smart lighting
   for a small town, a touristic location inside a nature reserve on the
   Italian coast. Three different approaches have been proposed, from
   minimal to more invasive interventions, and their effect on the
   territory has been investigated. Based on street typology and its
   surroundings, the work analyzes the opportunity to introduce smart and
   useful services for the citizens starting from a retrofitting
   intervention. Smart city capabilities are examined, showing how it is
   possible to provide new services to the cities through ICT (Information
   and Communication Technology) without deep changes and simplifying the
   control of basic city functions. The results evidence an important
   impact on annual energy costs, suggesting smart grid planning not only
   for metropolis applications, but also in smaller towns, such as the
   examined one.}},

Title = {{Implementing Smart Urban Metabolism in the Stockholm Royal Seaport:

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{For half a century, system scientists have relied on urban metabolism
   (UM) as a pragmatic framework to support the needed transition toward
   sustainable urban development. It has been suggested that information
   and communication technology (ICT) and, more specifically, smart cities
   can be leveraged in this transition. Given the recent advances in smart
   cities, smart urban metabolism (SUM) is considered a technology-enabled
   evolution of the UM framework, overcoming some of its current
   limitations. Most significantly, the SUM framework works at high
   temporal (up to real-time) and spatial (down to household/individual)
   resolutions. This article presents the first implementation of SUM in
   the Smart City Stockholm Royal Seaport R\&D project; it further analyzes
   barriers and discusses the potential long-term implications of the
   findings. Four key performance indicators (KPIs) are generated in real
   time based on the integration of heterogeneous, real-time data sources.
   These are kilowatt-hours per square meter, carbon dioxide equivalents
   per capita, kilowatt-hours of primary energy per capita, and share of
   renewables percentage. These KPIs are fed back on three levels
   (household, building, and district) on four interfaces, developed for
   different audiences. The most challenging barrier identified was
   accessing and integrating siloed data from the different data owners
   (utilities, building owners, and so forth). It is hard to overcome
   unless a significant value is perceived. A number of long-term
   opportunities were described in the SUM context; among those, it is
   envisioned that SUM could enable a new understanding of the causalities
   that govern urbanism and allow citizens and city officials to receive
   feedback on the system consequences of their choices.}},

Abstract = {{The development and spread of `smart city' technologies, policies and
   practices is now an important element of contemporary urban governance,
   given the role of powerful global firms such as IBM, Siemens and Cisco
   in their authorship. Developing a relational ontology of global `smart
   city' firms, the paper explores the origin and development of IBM's
   pervasive and influential Smarter Cities strategies. The paper argues
   that for IBM, Smarter Cities represents an attempt to solve three
   strategic problems that face the firm: how to maximise its stored
   knowledge and ensure its labour costs deliver significant added value;
   how to construct new sectoral and geographic markets for this knowledge;
   and how to reduce, standardise and simplify the object of that knowledge
   the city as a scaleable commodity. To illustrate these issues, the paper
   first explores the strategic direction of IBM from being a loss-making
   computer hardware manufacturer, to an information technology
   consultancy, identifying the role of acquisitions, city partnership, and
   research and development in that process. Second, it identifies how IBM
   has constructed a market for city or municipal services within its suite
   of vertical specialist markets. Third, it describes the relationship
   between the marketing, modelling and visualisation practices that reduce
   and simplify urban problems for solution through the sale of proprietary
   software packages, consultancy services and hardware to their clients in
   city government. The paper concludes by arguing that the future of smart
   cities is inextricably linked to the internal knowledge organisation of
   a small number of global technology firms.}},

Abstract = {{Person re-identification (Re-ID) is the problem of matching a person
   from different cameras based on appearance. It has interesting algorithm
   challenges and extensive practical applications. This paper presents a
   weight-based sparse coding approach for person re-identification. First,
   three hypotheses are introduced to achieve a linear combination of
   images based on sparse coding. Then, we convert the person
   re-identification problem into an optimization problem with sparse
   constraints. To reduce the influence of abnormal residuals caused by
   occlusion and body variation, a weight-based sparse coding approach is
   proposed to achieve the optimal weights by the ordering statistics of
   square residuals iteratively. Experiments on various public datasets for
   different multi-shot modalities have shown good performance of the
   proposed approach compared with other state-of-the-art ones (more than
   42\% and 34\% at rank-1 on CAVIAR4REID and i-LIDS, respectively).}},

Title = {{Developing a Smart Grid that Customers can Afford: The Impact of
   Deferrable Demand}},
Journal = {{ENERGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{183-203}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{With more electricity generated from renewable sources, the importance
   of effective storage capacity is increasing due to its capability to
   mitigate the inherent variability of these sources, such as wind and
   solar power. However, the cost of dedicated storage is high and all
   customers eventually have to pay. Deferrable demand offers an
   alternative form of storage that is potentially less expensive because
   the capital cost is shared between providing an energy service and
   supporting the grid. This paper presents an empirical analysis to
   illustrate the beneficial effects of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles
   (PHEV) and thermal storage on the total system cost using data for a hot
   summer day in New York City. The analysis shows how customers can reduce
   total system costs and their bills by 1) shifting load from expensive
   peak periods to less expensive off-peak periods, 2) reducing the amount
   of installed conventional generating capacity needed to maintain System
   Adequacy, and 3) providing ramping services to mitigate the variability
   of generation from renewable sources. Moreover, this paper demonstrates
   economic benefits of different types of customers with different
   deferrable demand capabilities under two bill payment policies, flat
   price payment and optimum price payment, and it finally shows how long
   it takes for customers to fully pay back their initial capital costs of
   PHEV or thermal storage under two different policies.}},

Title = {{Benefits and challenges of using smart meters for advancing residential
   water demand modeling and management: A review}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{198-214}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, water smart metering programs have been
   launched in a number of medium to large cities worldwide to nearly
   continuously monitor water consumption at the single household level.
   The availability of data at such very high spatial and temporal
   resolution advanced the ability in characterizing, modeling, and,
   ultimately, designing user-oriented residential water demand management
   strategies. Research to date has been focusing on one or more of these
   aspects but with limited integration between the specialized
   methodologies developed so far. This manuscript is the first
   comprehensive review of the literature in this quickly evolving water
   research domain. The paper contributes a general framework for the
   classification of residential water demand modeling studies, which
   allows revising consolidated approaches, describing emerging trends, and
   identifying potential future developments. In particular, the future
   challenges posed by growing population demands, constrained sources of
   water supply and climate change impacts are expected to require more and
   more integrated procedures for effectively supporting residential water
   demand modeling and management in several countries across the world.

   which is based on historical data analysis previously stored in a
   database and collected from mobile devices' sensors. From the tests
   performed, the results show the importance of route guidance, taking
   into account the energy savings. The results also show significant
   changes on range prediction based on user and route taken. It is

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical technologies enable event-driven applications, which
   monitor in real-time the occurrence of certain inherently stochastic
   incidents. Those technologies are being widely deployed in cities around
   the world and one of their critical aspects is energy consumption, as
   they are mostly battery powered. The most representative examples of
   such applications today is smart parking Since parking sensors are
   devoted to detect parking events in almost-real time, strategies like
   data aggregation are not well suited to optimize energy consumption.
   Furthermore, data compression is pointless, as events are essentially
   binary entities. Therefore, this paper introduces the concept of Lean
   Sensing, which enables the relaxation of sensing accuracy at the benefit
   of improved operational costs. To this end, this paper departs from the
   concept of instantaneous randomness and it explores the correlation
   structure that emerges from it in complex systems. Then, it examines the
   use of this system-wide aggregated contextual information to optimize
   power consumption, thus going in the opposite way; from the system-level
   representation to individual device power consumption. The discussed
   techniques include customizing the data acquisition to temporal
   correlations (i.e, to adapt sensor behavior to the expected activity)
   and inferring the system-state from incomplete information based on
   spatial correlations. These techniques are applied to real-world
   smart-parking application deployments, aiming to evaluate the impact
   that a number of system-level optimization strategies have on devices
   power consumption.}},

   Index-Expanded (SCIE) database and Journal Citation Reports (JCR). The
   published papers from the subject of construction and building
   technology and their journals, authors, countries and keywords spanning
   over several aspects of research topics, proved that
   architecture/building research grew rapidly over the past 30 years, and
   the trend still continues in recent smart cities era. The purposed of
   this study were to identify the journals in the field of construction
   and building technology in smart city, make a comparative report on
   related researches, as well as propose a quality evaluation of those
   journals. Based on JCR and SCI paper data, the journals related to
   construction and building technology in smart city were assessed using
   ten metrics: languages, active degree, references, citation trends, main
   countries, leading institutes, cooperation trends, productive authors,
   author keywords and keywords plus. The results indicate that all the
   factors have great significance and are related to the impact of a
   journal. It also provides guidance to both evaluators and the study

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel adaptive cellular automaton co-occurrence
   (CACO) approach to forming information societies in smart cities. It
   develops an interest ontology of cellular automaton (CA) clustering

   proposed method is to integrate CA clustering with the ontology of user
   interests. We also adopt an interest ontology and a co-occurrence
   mechanism to calculate the relation between time and the popularity of
   the information. In addition, we take advantage of the pheromone
   mechanism to determine if the data transferred to the destination are
   popular and to analyze if there exists any duplication. The simulation
   results reveal the strengths of the proposed ``adaptive CACO

Abstract = {{The smart home infrastructure features the automatic control of various
   household appliances in the advanced metering infrastructure, which
   enables the connection of individual smart home systems to a smart grid.
   In such an infrastructure, each smart meter receives electricity price
   from utilities and uses a smart controller to schedule the household
   appliances accordingly. This helps shift the heavy energy load from peak
   hours to nonpeak hours. Such an architecture significantly improves the
   reliability of the power grid through reducing the peak energy usage,
   while benefiting the customers through reducing electricity bills. This
   paper presents a tutorial on the development of the smart controller to
   schedule household appliances, which is also known as smart home
   scheduling. For each individual user, a dynamic programming-based
   algorithm that schedules household appliances with discrete power levels
   is introduced. Based on it, a game theoretic framework is designed for
   multi-user smart home scheduling to mitigate the accumulated energy
   usage during the peak hours. The simulation results demonstrate that it
   can reduce the electricity bill by 30.11\% while still improving
   peak-to-average ratio (PAR) in the power grid. Furthermore, the
   deployment of smart home scheduling techniques in a big city is
   discussed. In such a context, the parallel computation is explored to
   tackle the large computational complexity, a machine assignment
   approximation algorithm is proposed to accelerate the smart home
   scheduling, and a new hieratical framework is proposed to reduce the
   communication overhead. The simulation results on large test cases
   demonstrate that the city level hierarchical smart home scheduling can
   achieve the bill reduction of 43.04\% and the PAR reduction of 47.50\%
   on average.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is a dynamic global information network
   consisting of Internet connected objects, such as Radio frequency
   identifications, sensors, actuators, as well as other instruments and

   solutions developed by start-ups, small and medium enterprises, large
   corporations, academic research institutes (such as universities), and
   private and public research organizations making their way into the
   market. In this paper, we survey over one hundred IoT smart solutions in
   the marketplace and examine them closely in order to identify the
   technologies used, functionalities, and applications. Based on the
   application domain, we classify and discuss these solutions under five
   different categories: 1) smart wearable; 2) smart home; 3) smart city;
   4) smart environment; and 5) smart enterprise. This survey is intended
   to serve as a guideline and a conceptual framework for future research

Abstract = {{There is a growing quantity of data being generated in all aspects of
   our lives. Individuals and organizations produce and collect a broad
   range of different types of data in order to perform their tasks.
   Governments are particularly significant in this respect, not only
   because of the quantity and centrality of the data they collect, but
   also because most government data are public data by law and, therefore,
   could be made openly available for public use. Despite a growing
   consensus that Open Government in general and Open Data in particular
   are good both for governments and for society at large, there is no
   clear way to enable empirical analysis and quantitative measurements of
   Open Government Data initiatives. Our research uses a holistic approach
   proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
   (OECD) that includes all stages in the deployment of an Open Government
   Data initiative, namely strategy, implementation, organization,
   communication, interaction, and Impact. The analysis shows that Spanish
   municipalities can be divided into three groups: municipalities that are
   performing reasonably well (A), municipalities that are doing something
   but not as much as the first group (B), and municipalities that are
   doing very little or almost nothing (C). The research also draws two
   basic similarities between groups A and B and two types of differences
   between them. Another conclusion is that the different dimensions
   explain partly (more than the 72\% of the variance) the difference
   between actual and expected performances supporting indirectly the
   OECD's framing and the probable existence of a pathway toward successful
   Open Government Data projects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an exploration towards the transposition of service
   science principles into design guidelines. This aims at capturing value
   co-creation service interactions embedding customer experience in
   service design and delivery activities. The new Socio-Technical Systems
   Engineering (STSE) process is proposed to guide improved design, and it
   is exemplified with a new real time service that provides integrated
   information for trip planning in a city. The STSE process supports a
   high level visual modelling approach assisted by model execution and
   simulation tools. From a service engineering perspective, the outcomes
   of this process are artefacts that automatically support consistency
   among design steps and effective integration of customer experience and
   stakeholder requirements through iterative cycles related to service
   design. The application of the STSE process in the design of an
   exploratory case study of a real time information and travel planning
   service is validated through simulation using an executable
   representation of requirements. It can be executed over more complex
   transport service offerings, with different resource allocation
   algorithms, or different public transport planning services over a
   sample of real users requesting information. Results of such a
   simulation are beneficial for the users, for the service providers, and
   for the authorities managing public transport in city or metropolitan

Abstract = {{The collection of actual traffic delays and road traffic speed data is
   essential in modelling urban transport resource efficiency, congestion
   and carbon and pollutant emissions, which is in turn part of core
   empirical basis for evidence-based policy making for improving urban
   sustainability. This data collection has also been one of the most
   expensive and time-consuming tasks, which restricts how well and how
   often the models can be built and validated, often to the extent that
   urban transport models have to rely on severely outdated data with
   sparse coverage. New smart data such as GPS vehicle traces has raised
   the prospect of remedying the data shortage, but for operational and
   data protection reasons often only low-sampling frequency traces are
   available. This paper proposes a novel method for estimating actual,
   congested link-speeds from low-sampling frequency taxi GPS traces that
   are publicly available. The method is based on a path inference process
   and is applied over a detailed road network in a large city region. It
   shows that low frequency GPS trajectories can significantly improve the
   spatial and temporal resolutions of traffic speed data for transport
   modelling and policy analysis. This opens up the prospect of improving
   road operation performance, managing travel demand and optimizing urban
   circulation.}},

Abstract = {{Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the shortest path problem (SPP) is a very
   well-known algorithm. When applied to real situations, although the
   shortest path can be computed with Dijkstra's algorithm, it is not
   always the one that is chosen. In traffic situations, for example, the
   driver may not know the exact length of the lanes or the shortest path
   to follow. Even more compelling is the fact that although the driver
   knows the shortest route, he/she may prefer choosing a different route.
   In this paper we present the new algorithm PEDA (Probabilistic Extension
   of Dijkstra's Algorithm) which introduces probabilistic changes in the
   weight of the edges and also in the decisions when choosing the shortest
   path. When PEDA is applied to traffic flow, more realistic simulations,
   in which the shortest path is not always chosen, are obtained. This more
   accurately simulates the more normal behavior of drivers.
   As an example of an application, we introduce the ATISMART+ model, an
   extension of the ATISMART model, where an accelerated-time simulation of
   car traffic in a smart city was described. In that previous work, all
   cars in the system used Dijkstra's algorithm to choose improved
   ATISMART(+) model, for accelerated time simulations of traffic flow in
   smart cities, uses the new PEDA algorithm. The results obtained show
   that ATISMART+ produces more realistic simulations considering different
   drivers' behaviors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{437-445}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Urban areas play a key role in climate change mitigation. We investigate
   here energy systems design to increase the use of renewable electricity
   (RE) such as photovoltaics and wind power in cities. We analyzed the
   hourly temporal and spatiotemporal energy demand and supply patterns in
   Delhi, Shanghai and Helsinki to understand how energy systems respond to
   high RE shares, and to determine realizable levels of RE power. The
   results indicate that if limiting the RE output to the instantaneous
   power demand, a 20\% yearly share of electricity could be reached.
   Increasing the RE beyond this limit without a smart design adds only
   limited benefit. Adding short-term electrical storage could increase the
   RE share of power in Shanghai to 50-70\%, in Delhi to 40-60\%, and in
   Helsinki to 25-35\%. An electricity-to-thermal conversion strategy in
   which surplus RE power is utilized for heating, enables to increase the
   wind power use in Helsinki up to 64\% of the yearly electricity demand,
   but in addition, to cover 30\% of the yearly heat demand. Such a scheme
   would add ca 10\% to the overall wind power investment. A high RE share
   affects the existing power mix and the plant capacity factors, which
   need to be re-optimized. In the above cases, RE replaces fossil fuel and
   coal power plants and therefore the CO2 emission reductions from smart
   design are proportional to the RE shares shown. Smart energy system
   design could help mainstreaming renewable electricity as part of the
   cities' carbon reduction strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The widespread and ubiquitous availability of Internet access enables
   the collective sharing of huge amount of data generated by heterogeneous
   sources. For example, the information, which will be exchanged among
   entities (sensors, people, and services) of future smart cities to
   enhance the security and lifestyle of their citizens, poses the
   challenging question of how this information can be efficiently and
   effectively maintained across the city. In this article, we propose a
   decentralized approach, based on the distributed geographic table (DGT)
   overlay scheme, which exploits geo-referenced information about nodes to
   achieve efficient data management. After recalling DGT main concepts, we
   illustrate the possible node types and how information can be published
   and retrieved within the network. To cope with the unavoidable node
   failures and disconnections, our approach leverages upon randomized
   network coding to increase the robustness of publish/retrieval
   operations. Evaluation is carried out through an extensive simulation
   analysis for a realistic urban scenario using the metrics of efficiency
   in data publication/search, resource availability, and storage occupancy
   requirements. Results show the approach effectiveness for large-scale
   sharing of geo-referenced information and tradeoffs between redundancy
   overhead and resource availability. A few results obtained with a
   preliminary DGT implementation are also presented in the paper.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND San Francisco has a distinguished history as a cosmopolitan,
   progressive, and international city, including extensive associations
   with global health. These circumstances have contributed to new,
   interdisciplinary scholarship in the field of global health diplomacy
   (GHD). In the present review, we describe the evolution and history of
   GHD at the practical and theoretical levels within the San Francisco
   medical community, trace related associations between the local and the
   global, and propose a range of potential opportunities for further
   development of this dynamic field.
   METHODS We provide a historical overview of the development of the ``San
   Francisco Model{''} of collaborative, community-owned HIV/AIDS treatment
   and care programs as pioneered under the ``Ward 86{''} paradigm of the
   1980s. We traced the expansion and evolution of this model to the
   national level under the Ryan White Care Act, and internationally via
   the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. In parallel, we describe
   the evolution of global health diplomacy practices, from the local to
   the global, including the integration of GHD principles into
   intervention design to ensure social, political, and cultural
   acceptability and sensitivity.
   RESULTS Global health programs, as informed by lessons learned from the
   San Francisco Model, are increasingly aligned with diplomatic principles
   and practices. This awareness has aided implementation, allowed
   policymakers to pursue related and progressive social and humanitarian
   issues in conjunction with medical responses, and elevated global health
   to the realm of ``high politics.{''}
   CONCLUSIONS In the 21st century, the integration between diplomatic,
   medical, and global health practices will continue under ``smart global
   health{''} and GHD paradigms. These approaches will enhance intervention
   cost-effectiveness by addressing and optimizing, in tandem with each
   other, a wide range of (health and non-health) foreign policy,
   diplomatic, security, and economic priorities in a synergistic
   manner-without sacrificing health outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{With the high speed development of accessing and producing data, the new
   research area named the big data is emerging. With the pervasive of the
   definition of the smart city, the surveillance system, huge number of
   video surveillance devices such as surveillance cameras has been built.
   The rapid increase in the available amount of surveillance video data
   has caused an urgent need to develop intelligent model to extract the
   video content.The surveillance video data has grown tremendously in
   recent years, but traffic violations still cause a lot of accidents and
   personal injury every year. There are the problems of ``cannot find{''},
   ``difficult to understand{''} for the mass surveillance video retrieval
   system. Knowledge map is a huge knowledge database, which can solve the
   above question. In this paper, the knowledge map in the traffic

Abstract = {{Urban environments present unique opportunities for developing new
   system architectures and applications aligned with the ``Internet of
   things{''} paradigm. The data sources are still largely provided by
   physical sensors and technical devices, albeit a significant role is
   already played (e.g. in environmental monitoring networks) by virtual or
   soft sensors provided by simulation models, while a growing role is
   being played by human data generated thru participatory platforms and
   specifically social networks. This wider framework provides new
   challenges to ``fuse{''} data from diverse data streams into coherent
   information and to design novel applications, to support the management
   of urban infrastructures. Statistical learning and, more recently,
   network science play a critical role in the design of the representation
   models and computational engines needed to turn the data resources into
   actionable knowledge. This paper draws upon the design experience gained
   from several EU projects and proposes a software architecture based on a
   network of services. Key issues are: how people use the city
   infrastructure (e.g. inferring the demand patterns); how to deal with
   the diverse, sparse, voluminous and inaccurate data delivered by an
   increasingly pervasive sensory infrastructure; how to assimilate real
   time data and develop stream reasoning capabilities; how to develop and
   incorporate probabilistic frameworks and new tools to model and
   visualize risk and uncertainty. This paper draws upon the results of the
   LENVIS FP7 project and the TAM TAM national project, respectively

Abstract = {{Thessaloniki undergoes radical changes: the city, although negatively
   affected by the recurrent effects of the economic crisis, is tentatively
   moving along the path to recovery. Taking advantage of lower rates in
   car use due to economic reasons, a Public Transport (PT) system reform,
   where the impact of adding value can thus be bigger, should be posed at
   the crux of the city's agenda. This reform refers to a provision of
   services contributing to the development of ``accessible affordable
   high-quality{''} PT, which should, however, be based on
   ``smart-and-soft{''} interventions that respect the limited budget while
   upgrading the perceived PT quality. Based on a dedicated examination of
   Thessaloniki, this paper seeks to determine users' needs and the impact
   on perceived time savings (and on modal shift) of key investments based
   on the exploitation of Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
   for PT. The paper examines the soft interventions because the current
   economic system cannot afford extra pressure from the adoption of costly
   measures. The paper concludes by verifying that ICT can play a catalytic
   role in changing passengers' perception concerning time savings and can
   encourage passengers to use PT more often. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Location Based Services (LBS) provide a new perspective for
   spatiotemporally analyzing dynamic urban systems. Research has
   investigated urban dynamics using LBS. However, less attention has been
   paid to the analysis of urban structure (especially commuting pattern)
   using smart card data (SCD), which are widely available in most large
   cities in China, and even in the world. This paper combines bus SCD for
   a one-week period with a oneday household travel survey, as well as a
   parcel-level land use map to identify job-housing locations and
   commuting trip routes in Beijing. Two data forms are proposed, one for
   jobs-housing identification and the other for commuting trip route
   identification. The results of the identification are aggregated in the
   bus stop and traffic analysis zone (TAZ) scales, respectively.
   Particularly, commuting trips from three typical residential communities
   to six main business zones are mapped and compared to analyze commuting
   patterns in Beijing. The identified commuting trips are validated by
   comparison with those from the survey in terms of commuting time and
   distance, and the positive validation results prove the applicability of
   our approach. Our experiment, as a first step toward enriching LBS data
   using conventional survey and urban GIS data, can obtain solid
   identification results based on rules extracted from existing surveys or
   censuses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   OpenStreetMap (OSM) makes it possible for citizens to contribute to the
   acquisition of geographic information. This paper studies the use of OSM
   data to find newly mapped or built roads that do not exist in a
   reference road map and create its updated version. For this purpose, we
   propose a progressive buffering method for determining an optimal buffer
   radius to detect the new roads in the OSM data. In the next step, the
   detected new roads are merged into the reference road maps
   geometrically, topologically, and semantically. Experiments with OSM
   data and reference road maps over an area of 8494 km(2) in the city of
   Wuhan, China and five of its 5 km x 5 km areas are conducted to
   demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method. It is shown
   that the OSM data can add 11.96\% or a total of 2008.6 km of new roads
   to the reference road maps with an average precision of 96.49\% and an
   average recall of 97.63\%.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of smart city gives an excellent resolution to construct and
   develop modern cities, and also demands infrastructure construction. How
   to build a safe, stable, and highly efficient public transportation
   system becomes an important topic in the process of city construction.
   In this work, we study the structural and robustness properties of
   transportation networks and their sub-networks. We introduce a
   complementary network model to study the relevance and complementarity
   between bus network and subway network. Our numerical results show that
   the mutual supplement of networks can improve the network robustness.
   This conclusion provides a theoretical basis for the construction of
   public traffic networks, and it also supports reasonable operation of
   managing smart cities.}},

Abstract = {{The main aim of smart cities is to achieve the sustainable use of
   resources. In order to make the correct use of resources, an accurate
   monitoring and management is needed. In some places, like underground
   aquifers, access for monitoring can be difficult, therefore the use of
   sensors can be a good solution. Groundwater is very important as a water
   resource. Just in the USA, aquifers represent the water source for 50\%
   of the population. However, aquifers are endangered due to the
   contamination. One of the most important parameters to monitor in
   groundwater is the salinity, as high salinity levels indicate
   groundwater salinization. In this paper, we present a specific sensor
   for monitoring groundwater salinization. The sensor is able to measure
   the electric conductivity of water, which is directly related to the
   water salinization. The sensor, which is composed of two copper coils,
   measures the magnetic field alterations due to the presence of electric
   charges in the water. Different salinities of the water generate
   different alterations. Our sensor has undergone several tests in order
   to obtain a conductivity sensor with enough accuracy. First, several
   prototypes are tested and are compared with the purpose of choosing the
   best combination of coils. After the best prototype was selected, it was
   calibrated using up to 30 different samples. Our conductivity sensor
   presents an operational range from 0.585 mS/cm to 73.8 mS/cm, which is
   wide enough to cover the typical range of water salinities. With this
   work, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to measure water
   conductivity using solenoid coils and that this is a low cost
   application for groundwater monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Social Internet of Things (SIoT) has gained much interest among
   different research groups in recent times. As a key member of a smart
   city, the vehicular domain of SIoT (SIoV) is also undergoing steep
   development. In the SIoV, vehicles work as sensor-hub to capture
   surrounding information using the in-vehicle and Smartphone sensors and
   later publish them for the consumers. A cloud centric cyber-physical
   system better describes the SIoV model where physical sensing-actuation
   process affects the cloud based service sharing or computation in a
   feedback loop or vice versa. The cyber based social relationship
   abstraction enables distributed, easily navigable and scalable
   peer-to-peer communication among the SIoV subsystems. These
   cyber-physical interactions involve a huge amount of data and it is
   difficult to form a real instance of the system to test the feasibility
   of SIoV applications. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to
   measure the workloads of various subsystems involved in the SIoV
   process. We present the basic model which is further extended to
   incorporate complex scenarios. We provide extensive simulation results
   for different parameter settings of the SIoV system. The findings of the
   analyses are further used to design example adaptation strategies for
   the SIoV subsystems which would foster deployment of intelligent
   transport systems.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) generates a large
   volume of data related with energy service. This paper exploits data
   mining approach for customer baseline load (CBL) estimation in demand
   response (DR) management. CBL plays a significant role in measurement
   and verification process, which quantifies the amount of demand
   reduction and authenticates the performance. The proposed data-driven
   baseline modeling is based on the unsupervised learning technique.
   Specifically we leverage both the self organizing map (SOM) and K-means
   clustering for accurate estimation. This two-level approach efficiently
   reduces the large data set into representative weight vectors in SOM,
   and then these weight vectors are clustered by K-means clustering to
   find the load pattern that would be similar to the potential load
   pattern of the DR event day. To verify the proposed method, we conduct
   nationwide scale experiments where three major cities' residential
   consumption is monitored by smart meters. Our evaluation compares the
   proposed solution with the various types of day matching techniques,
   showing that our approach outperforms the existing methods by up to a
   68.5\% lower error rate.}},

Abstract = {{The Birmingham Urban Climate Laboratory (BUCL) is a near-real-time,
   high-resolution urban meteorological network (UMN) of automatic weather
   stations and inexpensive, nonstandard air temperature sensors. The
   network has recently been implemented with an initial focus on

   of UMNs exist worldwide; however, BUCL is novel in its density, the
   low-cost nature of the sensors, and the use of proprietary Wi-Fi
   networks. This paper provides an overview of the logistical aspects of
   implementing a UMN test bed at such a density, including selecting
   appropriate urban sites; testing and calibrating low-cost, nonstandard
   equipment; implementing strict quality-assurance/quality-control
   mechanisms (including metadata); and utilizing preexisting Wi-Fi
   networks to transmit data. Also included are visualizations of data
   collected by the network, including data from the July 2013 U.K.

Abstract = {{Investigating congestion in train rapid transit systems (RTS) in today's
   urban cities is a challenge compounded by limited data availability and
   difficulties in model validation. Here, we integrate information from
   travel smart card data, a mathematical model of route choice, and a
   full-scale agent-based model of the Singapore RTS to provide a more
   comprehensive understanding of the congestion dynamics than can be
   obtained through analytical modelling alone. Our model is empirically
   validated, and allows for close inspection of congestion and scaling
   dynamics. By adjusting our model, we can estimate the effective capacity
   of the RTS trains as well as replicate the penultimate station effect,
   where commuters travel backwards to the preceding station to catch a
   seat, sacrificing time for comfort. Using current data, the crowdedness
   in all 121 stations appears to be distributed log-normally. We find that

   approximately 10\% leads to an exponential deterioration in service
   quality. We also show that incentivizing commuters to avoid the most
   congested hours can bring modest improvements to the service quality.
   Finally, our model can be used to generate simulated data for
   statistical analysis when such data are not empirically available, as is
   often the case. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With more people living in cities, urban sensing is urgently required to
   create a comfortable and convenient living environment. As Internet of
   Things (IoT) is the fundamental infrastructure to realize urban sensing,
   it should be flexible to support various application requirements and
   convenient management of infrastructure. Inspired by software-defined
   networking, which aims to make networks more flexible, the authors
   propose a software-defined IoT architecture for smart urban sensing.
   This architecture decouples urban sensing applications from the physical
   infrastructure. Centralized controllers are designed to manage physical
   devices and provide APIs of data acquisition, transmission, and
   processing services to develop urban sensing applications. With these
   properties, various applications can coexist on the shared
   infrastructure, and each application can request controllers to
   customize its data acquisition, transmission, and processing on-demand
   by generating specific configurations of physical devices. This article
   discusses the background, benefits, and design details of the proposed
   architecture as well as open problems and potential solutions to realize
   it, which opens a new research direction for IoT and urban sensing.}},

Title = {{Coordinated online in-vehicle routing balancing user optimality and
   system optimality through information perturbation}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{121-133}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The inconsistence between system optimality and user optimality
   represents one of the key difficulties on network traffic congestion
   control. The advanced connected vehicle systems, enabling smart vehicles
   to possess/exchange real-time information and conduct portable
   computation, provide new opportunities to address this challenge.
   Motivated by this view, this study proposes a coordinated online
   in-vehicle routing mechanism with intentional information provision
   perturbation (CRM-IP), which seeks to shape individual vehicles online
   routing decisions so that user optimality and system optimality are
   balanced, by exploiting bounded rationality of the users. The proposed
   CRM-IP is modeled as a pure strategy atomic routing game, and
   implemented by a sequentially updating distributed algorithm. The
   mathematical analysis is conducted to quantify the absolute gain of
   system optimality corresponding to the loss of user optimality resulting
   from a given level of the information perturbation in the worst case so
   that the efficiency of the information perturbation can be evaluated.
   Furthermore, numerical experiments conducted based on City of Sioux
   Falls network investigate the average effects of the CRM-IP on system
   optimality and user optimality under various network traffic conditions,
   comparing to the CRM developed by Du et al. (in press). The results
   indicate that the improvement of system optimality and the reduction of
   individual vehicles' travel time from the CRM is more significant when
   the network traffic is under an mild congestion state, such as under the
   levels of service (LOS's) C, D, and E, rather than under extremely
   sparse or congested states, such as under LOS's A and B, or F. Moreover,
   higher level of information perturbation benefits system optimality
   more, but the marginal effect decreases after the perturbation reaching
   certain level, such as lambda = 0.1 in this case study. In addition, a
   portion of vehicles may sacrifice user optimality due to the information
   perturbation, but the extent of the sacrifice is not significant, even
   though it increases with the information perturbation level. Hence, a
   small information perturbation is recommended to achieve an efficient
   network traffic control through the CRM-IP. Overall, this study proposes
   the CRM-IP as an efficient routing mechanism, which has a great
   potential to guide the routing decisions of individual vehicles so that
   their collective behavior improve network performance in both system
   optimality and user optimality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A ferry-assisted solution for forwarding function in Wireless Sensor
   Networks}},
Journal = {{PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{SI}},

Abstract = {{For sure, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are becoming an ultimate part
   of next generation mobile networks. They are a master piece for
   Ubiquitous computing. Indeed, they sustain development of numerous
   paradigms/ technologies such as distributed ambient intelligence,
   context-awareness and future mobile networking (e.g., B4G and 5G).
   Battery life remains one of the crucial problems to handle. In this
   article we propose an infrastructure-based topology using mobile ferries
   (mobile micro-base stations). In real life, a ferry could be robot, bus,
   tram, train or any other engine scrutinizing periodically a given area.
   Yet, message ferries are moving along concentric annulus and may collect
   data generated by the static sensors (could be classic sensors, smart
   meters, wearable devices, etc.) randomly distributed on given area.
   Next, transmissions are performed in a ferry-to-ferry forwarding scheme
   till arriving at the sink. Considered ferries could sense themselves
   data and therefore behave as mobile sensors allowing better awareness on
   the area state {[}1-3]. Our scheme could also assist Machine-to-Machine
   communications to increase the network lifetime, with potentially some
   cognitive-radio capabilities and opportunistic detection and access. Our
   proposal can easily be integrated in a smart-city for better interaction
   and green communications. Next, we present a queueing model (queues with
   finite capacity) to handle the generated traffic and to analyze the
   behavior of mobile ferries. We provided a close-form expression for both
   end-to-end throughput and end-to-end delay. The main objective of this
   work is to improve the energy efficiency of the cognitive sensors by
   asking cognitive sensors to not care about forwarding data of each other
   except for urgent data, this latter point is out of the scope of the
   paper. These static sensors will only care about data sensing, which
   will reduce their individual energy consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Smart urbanism is emerging at the intersection of visions for the future
   of urban places, new technologies and infrastructures. Smart urbanism
   discourses are deeply rooted in seductive and normative visions of the
   future where digital technology stands as the primary driver for change.
   Yet our understanding of the opportunities, challenges, and implications
   of smart urbanism is limited. Research in this field is in its infancy,
   fragmented along disciplinary lines and often based on single city case
   studies. As a result, we lack both the theoretical insight and empirical
   evidence required to assess the implications of this potentially
   transformative phenomenon. Given the significant implications of smart
   urbanism there is an urgent need to critically engage with why, how, for
   whom and with what consequences smart urbanism is emerging in different
   urban contexts. The aim of this review is to unpack the different logics
   and rationales behind smart urbanism discourses and proposals, and in
   this way understand the ways by which imaginaries of urban futures are
   currently being constructed, along with their socio-technical and
   political implications for future research priorities.}},

Abstract = {{In technical terms, a micro smart grid is one solution for future energy
   supply from renewable energy sources with the aid of information
   technology. However, it also symbolises the idea of a transformation
   into a low-carbon, non-fossil-fuel society. This paper analyses that the
   micro smart grid works as a sociotechnical imaginary and boundary object
   across a specific actor constellation with plural backgrounds, interests
   and perspectives. Empirical data has been gathered for this study from
   an urban innovation campus in Germany, an ascribed living lab for
   innovation and research that represents an especially designated place
   combined with spatially embedded visions of the future city and energy
   system. Here the micro smart grid imaginary is closely interlinked with
   the place and becomes materialised: it is argued that despite the micro
   smart grid's incomplete status in terms of technical advancement and
   reliability, the imaginary already generates cooperation and commitment
   across actor groups and sectors. The place provides a shared, protected
   experimental space as well as boundary objects, thus, first, enabling
   the actors to cope with the perceived uncertainty in the transition
   process. Second, it fosters innovation, new business models and forms of
   cooperation, and thereby, third, contributes to the energy system

Abstract = {{Recent advances in information and communication technologies and

   location and movements and so on. In this paper, at first, we propose a
   distributed IoT system architecture. Subsequently, we propose an
   anonymous authentication scheme, which can ensure some of the notable
   properties, such as sensor anonymity, sensor untraceability, resistance
   to replay attacks, cloning attacks, and so on. It is argued that the
   proposed authentication scheme will be useful in many distributed IoT

Abstract = {{The demand of electricity keeps increasing in this modern society and
   the behavior of customers vary greatly from time to time, city to city,
   type to type, etc. Generally, buildings are classified into residential,
   commercial and industrial. This study is aimed to distinguish the types
   of residential buildings in Singapore and establish a mathematical model
   to represent and model the load profile of each type. Modeling household
   energy consumption is the first step in exploring the possible demand
   response and load reduction opportunities under the smart grid
   initiative. Residential electricity load profiling includes the details
   on the electrical appliances, its energy requirement, and consumption
   pattern. The model is generated with a bottom-up load model. Simulation
   is performed for daily load profiles of 1 or 2 rooms, 3 rooms, 4 rooms
   and 5 rooms public housing. The simulated load profile is successfully
   validated against the measured electricity consumption data, using a
   web-based Customer Energy Portal (CEP) at the campus housings of Nanyang
   Technological University, Singapore.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Despite the ongoing discussion of the recent years, there is no agreed
   definition of a `smart city', while strategic planning in this field is
   still largely unexplored. Inspired by this, the purpose of this paper
   was to identify the forces shaping the smart city conception and, by
   doing so, to begin replacing the currently abstract image of what it
   means to be one. The paper commences by dividing the recent history of
   smart cities into two large sections - urban futures and the knowledge
   and innovation economy. The urban futures strand shows that technology
   has always played an important role in forward-looking visions about the
   city of the future. The knowledge and innovation economy strand shows
   that recent technological advancements have introduced a whole new level
   of knowledge management and innovation capabilities in the urban
   context. The paper proceeds to explicate the current technology push and
   demand pull for smart city solutions. On one hand, technology advances
   rapidly and creates a booming market of smart city products and
   solutions around it. On the other hand, there is demand on the side of
   cities that seek to address the problems of efficiency and
   sustainability, making the ground fertile for a smart city product
   economy. The research route of this paper eventually allows the
   identification of the underlying - and often forgotten - principles of
   what it means to be `smart' in an urban context and yields conclusions
   about strategic planning for the development of smart cities today. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper can be framed within the growing interest in the public
   dimension of technology design: it proposes a framework for the public
   design of urban technologies by elaborating on the concepts of digital

   through the case study of a mobility application developed within a
   wider project of digital commons design. We contrast a Smart City
   approach and a urban computing one, and we argue that the latter is more
   fruitful in the long run, since it entails elements for the
   establishment of forms of recursive engagement of users, who co-produce
   digital commons together with technology designers as a response to
   their matters of concern. Applying our framework to the design of urban
   technologies, we conclude that design should support collaborative
   practices starting from the articulation of matters of concern to
   designing in a participatory way. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{With today's ubiquitous computing technologies, our daily activities are
   continuously traced by smartphones in our pockets and more of our
   everyday things are now connected to the Internet. This phenomena is
   changing the way we live, work, and interact. This creates, not only
   technological opportunities for smarter cities, but also interactional
   opportunities for the citizens. However, designing, developing, and
   deploying urban computing projects in the wild, outside the controlled
   research environment, is challenging, due to the complexity of the urban
   context as well as the people who live in it. What are the ways to
   trigger and increase the public towards active participation or
   technological uptake in urban computing? How to design and structure
   participation for urban computing research and technologies in the wild
   for it to lead to mass participation with its citizens? These are the
   questions that are investigated in this paper. We present a survey on
   existing approaches in engaging participations and devising interactions
   with a range of existing urban computing technologies: smartphones,
   public displays, cyber physical systems (including those with embedded
   systems, sensors, and actuators), and Internet of Things. Based on the
   reviews, we propose a taxonomy for categorising and characterising urban
   computing technologies and approaches with regards to the level of
   participation they stimulate, the participation scale they support, the
   manipulation and effects mode they enable, and the interaction mode and
   scale they enable. Finally, strategies for structuring and engendering
   participations and interactions based on our own experience from
   deploying small to large scale urban computing projects in the wild are
   presented in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The smart convergence environment, in which all industries are converged
   around ICT infrastructure -- with the eventual inclusion of both
   industry and culture -- looms. With the emergence of new convergence
   industries such as smart medicine, smart cities, and smart automobiles,
   the ICT infrastructure is recognized as the foundation of the overall
   economy. As such, the importance of the next generation of information
   and communication construction businesses, which constructs the ICT
   infrastructure, is highlighted under the smart convergence paradigm
   environment; various multilateral policies to foster the information and
   communication construction business -- led by the Ministry of Science,
   ICT, and Future Planning -- are being implemented. Like other
   infrastructure industries, however, the estimation of the demand
   function of the information and communication construction business
   overall is essential for effectively establishing promotional policies
   for information and communication construction businesses. However,
   there has been no study which theoretically estimates the market demand
   function in the information and communication construction business thus
   far. The pursuit of a creative economy is a national agenda, as the
   significance of accelerating the ICT infrastructure is emphasized.
   Therefore, this paper seeks to estimate quantitatively the demand
   function in the information and communication construction business
   using empirical data and a statistical model and then to present policy
   implications which will aid the development of the information and

Abstract = {{Avoiding urban sprawl and increasing density are often considered as
   effective means to mitigate climate change through urban planning.
   However, there have been rapid technological changes in the fields of
   housing energy and private driving, and the development is continuing.
   In this study, we analyze the carbon footprints of the residents living
   in new housing in different urban forms in Finland. We compare the new
   housing to existing housing stock. In all areas, the emissions from
   housing energy were significantly lower in new buildings. However, in
   the inner urban areas the high level of consumption, mostly due to
   higher affluence, reverse the gains of energy efficient new housing. The
   smallest carbon footprints were found in newly built outer and pen-urban
   areas, also when income level differences were taken into account.
   Rather than strengthening the juxtaposition of urban and suburban areas,
   we suggest that it would be smarter to recognize the strengths and
   weaknesses of both modes of living and develop a more systemic strategy
   that would result in greater sustainability in both areas. Since such
   strategy does not exist yet, it should be researched and practically
   developed. It would be beneficial to focus on area specific mitigation
   measures.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{AUG 18}},
Abstract = {{Surveillance video service (SVS) is one of the most important services
   provided in a smart city. It is very important for the utilization of
   SVS to provide design efficient surveillance video analysis techniques.
   Key frame extraction is a simple yet effective technique to achieve this
   goal. In surveillance video applications, key frames are typically used
   to summarize important video content. It is very important and essential
   to extract key frames accurately and efficiently. A novel approach is
   proposed to extract key frames from traffic surveillance videos based on
   GPU (graphics processing units) to ensure high efficiency and accuracy.
   For the determination of key frames, motion is a more salient feature in
   presenting actions or events, especially in surveillance videos. The
   motion feature is extracted in GPU to reduce running time. It is also
   smoothed to reduce noise, and the frames with local maxima of motion
   information are selected as the final key frames. The experimental
   results show that this approach can extract key frames more accurately
   and efficiently compared with several other methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates temporal and weather-related variation in taxi
   trips in New York City. A taxi trip data-set with 147 million records
   covering 10 months of activity is used. It is shown that there are
   substantial variations in ridership, taxi supply, trip distance, and
   pickup frequency for different time periods and weather conditions.
   These variations, in turn, cause variations in driver revenues which is
   one of the main measures of taxi supply-demand equilibrium. The findings
   are then used to discuss the anticipated impacts of two recently enacted
   taxi regulation changes: the first fare increase since 2006 and the
   E-Hail pilot program which allows taxi hailing with smart phone
   applications. The fare increase is estimated to cause varying levels of
   revenue increase for different time periods. E-Hail apps are not
   expected to offer considerable improvements at all times, but rather
   when both adequate taxi supply and demand occur simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{We present a model developed to study the increase of self-consumption
   of photovoltaic (PV) power by smart charging of electric vehicles (EVs)
   and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. Whereas previous studies mostly
   use large EV fleets in their models, our focus is on a smaller scale. We
   apply the model to a microgrid in Lombok, a residential neighbourhood in
   the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands. The microgrid consists of a 31 kWp
   PV installation, an office, internet servers, three households, and two
   EVs. Three control algorithms are presented which manage the charging
   profile of multiple EVs either in real-time or using linear optimisation
   with predictions for PV power and electricity demand. We perform
   one-year simulations using data for PV power, EV use, and electricity
   demand. Simulations results are evaluated on PV self-consumption and
   peak demand reduction. In addition, we make qualitative statements on
   battery degradation resulting from the charging strategies based on
   several indicators. We also simulate changes in microgrid composition,
   for example by including more EVs. In the simulations, self-consumption
   increases from 49\% to 62-87\% and demand peaks decrease by 27-67\%.
   These results clearly demonstrate the benefits of smart charging EVs
   with PV power. Furthermore, our results give insight into the effect of
   different charging strategies and microgrid compositions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Electronic toll collection transponders, e.g., E-ZPass, arc a
   widely-used wireless technology. About 70\% to 89\% of the cars in US
   have these devices, and some states plan to make them mandatory. As
   wireless devices however, they lack a basic function: a MAC protocol
   that prevents collisions. Hence, today, they can be queried only with
   directional antennas in isolated spots. However, if one could interact
   with e-toll transponders anywhere in the city despite collisions, it
   would enable many smart applications. For example, the city can query
   the transponders to estimate the vehicle flow at every intersection. It
   can also localize the cars using their wireless signals, and detect
   those that run a redlight. The same infrastructure can also deliver
   smart street parking, where a user parks anywhere on the street, the
   city localizes his car, and automatically charges his account.
   This paper presents Caraoke, a networked system for delivering smart
   services using e-toll transponders. Our design operates with existing
   unmodified transponders, allowing for applications that communicate
   with, localize, and count transponders, despite wireless collisions. To
   do so, Caraoke exploits the structure of the transponders' signal and
   its properties in the frequency domain. We built Caraoke reader into a
   small PCB that harvests solar energy and can be easily deployed on
   street lamps. We also evaluated Caraoke on four streets on our campus
   and demonstrated its capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The development of efficient mechanisms for detecting health issues in
   patients as early as possible is very welcome since the probability of
   positive outcomes from treatments increases if the health problem is
   detected on its early stages. On the other hand, many health issues can
   even be avoided if the condition of risk is detected before the patient
   start suffering from the disease. In this work, we propose a novel,
   efficient and low cost solution for indoor monitoring of patients for
   medical purposes based on Wi-Fi signal strength intensities and mobile
   computing. The output of our solution consist of reports containing the
   patterns of room occupation by patients inside home. These reports will
   allow health care professionals to detect changes on the behavior of
   patients that can be interpreted as early signs of health related
   issues. The proposed solution was implemented in an Android smartphone
   and tested in a real scenario. To assess our solution, 10 monitoring
   periods with the duration of approximately one hour each, were performed
   at different times. During each monitoring period, 40 random points were
   selected as measuring points and 391 correct detections out of 400
   possible were reached, corresponding to an average effectiveness of
   97.75\%.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pneumonia is the third most common cause of death in the
   world, and mortality is highest for patients who require
   hospitalization.
   Objectives:This prospective observational study is an etiological survey
   of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) over a 12-month period in the
   Iranian city of Mashhad. To our knowledge, this is one of the first
   prospective hospital-based studies to comprehensively evaluate the
   epidemiological, demographical, clinical, and prognostic factors of
   patients with CAP in Iran.
   Patients and Methods: We studied alladult patients (aged >= 16
   years)with CAP admitted to Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, between
   February 2013 and January 2014. The etiological diagnosis of CAP was
   made through conventional culturing and staining of respiratory
   secretions (i.e. sputum and pleural fluid), standard BACTEC((TM)) Plus
   Aerobic/F bottles for blood cultures, and the immunochromatographic
   assays BinaxNOW (R) Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen and BinaxNOW (R)
   Legit-menu pneumophila antigen for the detect ion of S. pneumoniae
   antigen and L. pnewnophila serogroup I antigen, respectively
   Results: Among120 patients with CAP, the most common etiology was S.
   pneumoniae (24.4\%), followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (17.5\%), S.
   aureus (6.7\%), polymicrobial agents including anaerobes (4.2\%),
   complicated hydatid cyst (2.5\%), Influenza A virus (4.2\%; including 2
   cases of mixed Influenza A-bacterial infection), and Klebsiella
   pneumoniae, Brucella melitensis,Mucor, and varicella, each in 0.8\% of
   the patients. The diagnosis of pneumonia remained unknown in 49(40\%)
   patients.
   Conclusions: Tuberculosis was an important cause of CAP in our region.
   Hence, it should be considered in all patients admitted with a CAP
   diagnosis.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{355-365}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The performance of physical assets has become a major determinant
   success factor for urban flood control. However, managing these assets
   is always challenging as there are a huge number of diverse assets
   involved, which are distributed throughout the city, and owned by
   different agencies. Aiming at improving the management efficiency of
   these assets, and ensuring their performance, this paper proposes the
   concept of cloud asset based on cloud computing, mobile agent, and
   various smart devices. Through hardware integration and software
   encapsulation, cloud asset could sense its real-time status, adapt to
   varied working scenarios, be controlled remotely, and shared among
   agencies. It enables accurate real-time control of every asset, and thus
   improves the management efficiency and effectiveness. This paper first
   presents the concept of cloud asset with its technical architecture, and
   then analyses the software agent model for cloud asset, which is the key
   enabler to realize UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) management of assets,
   and provides mobility and intelligence for them. After that, the
   framework of cloud asset-enabled workflow management is built, in which
   cloud asset could be easily found and dynamically invoked by different
   workflows. Finally, a demonstrative case is provided to verify the
   effectiveness of cloud asset. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   order to provide more time to the drivers and VRU to take the
   appropriate maneuver and avoid a possible collision. The information
   generated by mobile sensors (vehicles and cyclists) is sent over this
   heterogeneous communication architecture and processed in a central
   server, the Drivers Cloud, which is in charge of generating the messages
   that are shown on the drivers' and cyclists' Human Machine Interface
   (HMI). First of all, V-Alert has been tested in a simulated scenario to
   check the communications architecture in a complex scenario and, once it
   was validated, all the elements of V-Alert have been moved to a real

   huge amounts of valuable sensing data in urban environments, by
   opportunistically involving citizens to play the role of mobile virtual
   sensors to cover Smart City areas of interest. This paper proposes an
   in-depth study of the challenging technical issues related to the
   efficient assignment of Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) data collection tasks
   to volunteers in a crowdsensing campaign. In particular, the paper
   originally describes how to increase the effectiveness of the proposed
   sensing campaigns through the inclusion of several new facilities,
   including accurate participant selection algorithms able to profile and
   predict user mobility patterns, gaming techniques, and timely
   geo-notification. The reported results show the feasibility of
   exploiting profiling trends/prediction techniques from volunteers'
   behavior; moreover, they quantitatively compare different MCS task
   assignment strategies based on large-scale and real MCS data campaigns
   run in the ParticipAct living lab, an ongoing MCS real-world experiment
   that involved more than 170 students of the University of Bologna for
   more than one year.}},

Abstract = {{Among the key aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT) is the integration
   of heterogeneous sensors in a distributed system that performs actions
   on the physical world based on environmental information gathered by
   sensors and application-related constraints and requirements. Numerous
   applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have appeared in various
   fields, from environmental monitoring, to tactical fields, and
   healthcare at home, promising to change our quality of life and
   facilitating the vision of sensor network enabled smart cities. Given
   the enormous requirements that emerge in such a settingboth in terms of
   data and energydata aggregation appears as a key element in reducing the
   amount of traffic in wireless sensor networks and achieving energy
   conservation. Probabilistic frameworks have been introduced as
   operational efficient and performance effective solutions for data
   aggregation in distributed sensor networks. In this work, we introduce
   an overall optimization approach that improves and complements such
   frameworks towards identifying the optimal probability for a node to
   aggregate packets as well as the optimal aggregation period that a node
   should wait for performing aggregation, so as to minimize the overall
   energy consumption, while satisfying certain imposed delay constraints.
   Primal dual decomposition is employed to solve the corresponding
   optimization problem while simulation results demonstrate the
   operational efficiency of the proposed approach under different traffic
   and topology scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Cities are composed of complex systems with physical, cyber, and social
   components. Current works on extracting and understanding city events
   mainly rely on technology-enabled infrastructure to observe and record
   events. In this work, we propose an approach to leverage citizen
   observations of various city systems and services, such as traffic,
   public transport, water supply, weather, sewage, and public safety, as a
   source of city events. We investigate the feasibility of using such
   textual streams for extracting city events from annotated text. We
   formalize the problem of annotating social streams such as microblogs as
   a sequence labeling problem. We present a novel training data creation
   process for training sequence labeling models. Our automatic training
   data creation process utilizes instance-level domain knowledge (e.g.,
   locations in a city, possible event terms). We compare this automated
   annotation process to a state-of-the-art tool that needs manually
   created training data and show that it has comparable performance in
   annotation tasks. An aggregation algorithm is then presented for event
   extraction from annotated text. We carry out a comprehensive evaluation
   of the event annotation and event extraction on a real-world dataset
   consisting of event reports and tweets collected over 4 months from the
   San Francisco Bay Area. The evaluation results are promising and provide
   insights into the utility of social stream for extracting city events.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen, a clean-burning fuel, is of key importance to various
   industrial applications, including fuel cells and the aerospace and
   automotive industries. However, hydrogen gas is odorless, colorless, and
   highly flammable; thus, appropriate safety protocol implementation and
   monitoring are essential. Highly sensitive hydrogen-gas leak detection
   and surveillance systems are needed; additionally, the ability to
   monitor large areas (e.g., cities) via wireless networks is becoming
   increasingly important. In this report, we introduce a radio frequency
   identification (RFID)based wireless smart-sensor system, composed of a
   Pt-decorated reduced graphene oxide (Pt\_rGO)-immobilized RFID sensor
   tag and an RFID-reader antenna-connected network analyzer to detect
   hydrogen gas. The Pt\_rGOs, produced using a simple chemical reduction
   process, were immobilized on an antenna pattern in the sensor tag
   through spin coating. The resulting Pt\_rGO-based RFID sensor tag
   exhibited a high sensitivity to hydrogen gas at unprecedentedly low
   concentrations (1 ppm), with wireless communication between the sensor
   tag and RFID-reader antenna. The wireless sensor tag demonstrated
   flexibility and a long lifetime due to the strong immobilization of
   Pt\_rGOs on the substrate and battery-independent operation during
   hydrogen sensing, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Thanks to the development of technology and the emergence of intelligent
   services smart cities promise to their inhabitants enhanced perception
   of city life. For example, a live timetable service of public
   transportation can increase the efficiency of travel planning
   substantially. However, its implementation in a traditional way requires
   the deployment of some costly sensing and tracking infrastructure.
   Mobile crowdsensing is an alternative, when the crowd of passengers and
   their mobile devices are used to gather data for almost free of charge.
   In this paper, we put the emphasis on the introduction of our
   crowdsensing based public transport information service, what we have
   been developing as a prototype smart city application. The front-end
   interface of this service is called TrafficInfo. It is a simple and
   easy-to-use Android application which visualizes real-time public
   transport information of the given city on Google Maps. The lively
   updates of transport schedule information relies on the automatic stop
   event detection of public transport vehicles. TrafficInfo is built upon
   our Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) based
   communication framework what we designed to facilitate the development
   of crowd assisted smart city applications. The paper introduces shortly
   this framework, than describes TrafficInfo in detail together with the
   developed stop event detector.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been made a great effort to include electricity
   generation from the renewable energy sources into the power system.
   Random renewable generation creates the imbalance between electricity
   production and consumption, which requires power plants with fast
   response or energy storage systems. Generally accepted solution for load
   balancing is the concept of smart grids and one of the elements of smart
   grid efficiency is the ability of real-time demand-supply balancing. In
   this paper, the model of the part of power distribution network of the
   city of Osijek has been created based on results of the power
   measurements of total electricity consumption in a family house in
   Osijek, air conditioning system consumption and PV power plant
   production. Also, algorithm for real-time load management is proposed.
   It assumes coordinated control of air conditioning system units
   depending on the production of PV power plants and electricity
   consumption of distribution network, in order to reduce peak demand in
   the distribution network.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EVs) are being introduced by different manufacturers
   as an environment-friendly alternative to vehicles with internal
   combustion engines. The number of EVs is expected to grow rapidly in the
   coming years which will act as distributed loads in the demand side of
   the smart grid. On the supply side, an aggregator has to predict a load
   schedule 12-36 h in advance to charge the EVs and purchase energy
   accordingly from the day-ahead market. The goal of the aggregator is to
   schedule the EVs at different charging stations along the route of the
   EVs for charging so that the energy imbalance between the energy
   purchased and the energy consumed by the EVs is minimized while
   maximizing the number of EVs charged. In this work, we refer to this
   problem as the Bounded Maximum Energy Usage Maximum EV Charging Problem
   where mobile EVs communicate their charging preferences to the
   aggregator and the aggregator schedules EVs to different charging
   stations in their route so as to maximize both the purchased energy
   utilization (and therefore, minimum energy imbalance) and the number of
   EVs charged. We first prove that the problem is NP-complete. A
   pseudo-polynomial algorithm is proposed for a restricted version of the
   problem that can act as an upper bound for the energy usage. We also
   give an upper bound for the number of EVs charged. An offline and an
   online heuristic are then proposed to solve the problem. Detailed
   simulation results in different city traffic scenarios are presented to
   show the performance of the algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   papers, three strands remained for subsequent analysis: bohemian,
   bohemian + creative-city, and smart regeneration. The first is static or
   historically contextualized, situated best in the humanities. The last
   two strands are dynamic and dissect, descriptively or analytically,
   elements of bohemianism relevant to the urban scene. Wherever and

Abstract = {{Big data techniques are conceived as the powerful tool to exploit all
   the potential of the Internet of Things and the smart cities. A new
   dimension of understanding about the human behaviours is expected to be
   reached through all the gathered data in the emerging smart environment.
   The described potential, so-called Human Dynamics, pursues to describe
   in real-time the human behaviours and activities. This work presents our
   experiences for big data analytics in smart cities, in terms of sensors
   data management, data fusion and knowledge discovery from the data. The
   data used is from the European Project SmartSantander, where the traffic
   behaviour has been correlated with respect to the temperature in the
   Santander City. The evolution of both flows present a similar behaviour,
   in detail, a fine grain correlation is discovered. On the one hand, the
   traffic distribution, aggregated by temperature bins, follows up a
   Poisson distribution model. The Poisson modelling allows to interpolate
   and predict complex behaviours based on simple measures such as the
   temperature. At the same time, on the other hand, the isolated traffic
   density distribution, without taking into account the temperature-based
   aggregation has been analysed. The traffic distribution has presented a
   burst behaviour, which presents a closer model to the human dynamics.
   Therefore, this work presents as the smart cities data can be modelled
   as Poisson or Human Dynamics (burst models). Finally, reference data
   analytics process, data sets and models are offered for the Open Source
   Data analytics platform Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME). Copyright

Abstract = {{The article looks at the evolution of urban branding in the city of
   Turin, Italy, over a period of about ten years. As reported in a
   previous article published in Cities, at the end of the nineties the
   city of Turin started investing heavily in creative and cultural
   branding strategies, in order to modify its former image of an
   industrial one-company town. This article looks at the same city eight
   years later: both Turin and the general socio-economic situation have
   changed, primarily because of the ongoing economic crisis. As a result,
   other discourses are emerging in the field of urban branding, with a
   meaningful divide between the `internal' dimension of branding (messages
   directed to inhabitants and city users) and its `external' dimension.
   Specifically, the article considers the role and heritage of `old'
   discourses on culture and creativity and the diffusion of new branding
   messages related to food and to the imagery of the `smart city'. (C)

Abstract = {{We proposed a methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of Beijing's

   developed four types of measures to evaluate the effectives of UGBs in
   confining human activities and travel flows, to examine the conformity
   of urban activities with the planned population, and to measure the
   activity connections between UGBs. With the large proportions of intra-
   and inter-boundary travel flows and an overwhelming majority of
   check-ins inside the UGBs, the research concluded that Beijing's UGBs
   were effective in containing human mobility and activity. However, the
   connections between UGBs, indicated by the spatial differentiation of
   the travel flows, were not consistent with the plan's intention and
   strategy. It indicated the potential underdevelopment of the public

Abstract = {{This study introduces a schematic methodology for smart water grids
   (SWGs) for use in water management platforms, which integrates
   information and communication technology (ICT) into a single water
   management scheme. SWG technology is seen as a promising solution for
   resolving recent critical global water problems. To ensure the security
   of water quantity, safety of water quality, and ICT-based water
   management solutions, SWG technology should integrate five prime
   research areas: (1) platform configuration in both water and ICT
   networks, (2) guarantee water resources including both natural and
   manufactured water, (3) intelligent control of water flow using
   bi-directional communication in water infrastructure, (4) better
   management scheme dealing with risk-minimization for assets in the water
   infrastructure, and (5) energy efficiency in operating and maintaining
   water infrastructure. Two platforms (i.e. water and ICT platforms) are
   introduced as examples of well-designed platforms for the management of
   bi-directional water and data flows in accordance with both the
   consumer's water demands and supplier's water distribution schemes, in
   both centralized and decentralized water distribution grids. To
   guarantee water resources, harvesting both natural sources (e.g. river,
   lake, groundwater, etc.) and manufactured sources (e.g. desalination,
   reused waters, etc.) is proposed as a top priority. Using the platforms
   and multiple water resources, the intelligent water grid control plays a
   key role in satisfying the consumer's as well as the supplier's water
   needs, using self-diagnosing sensors and ICT-based cooperative networks.
   Improved management in risk-minimization for water infrastructure assets
   requires the GIS-based information of assets, their historical changes,
   and their renewal plans according to monitoring/forecasting data, etc.
   To improve water infrastructure energy efficiency, low energy processes
   combined with alternative energy sources and smart power grid management
   are suggested as key cost-saving methods for water production and/or
   distribution. Thus, integrating the five prime research areas in SWG
   technology can provide water managers insight into planning water
   infrastructure and shed light on the roles of the SWGs in future smart
   cities.}},

Title = {{Can Walking or Biking to Work Really Make a Difference? Compact
   Development, Observed Commuter Choice and Body Mass Index}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   Promoting active commuting is viewed as one strategy to increase
   physical activity and improve the energy balance of more sedentary
   individuals thereby improving health outcomes. However, the potential
   effectiveness of promotion policies may be seriously undermined by the
   endogenous choice of commute mode. Policy to promote active commuting
   will be most effective if it can be demonstrated that 1) those in
   compact cities do not necessarily have a preference for more physical
   activity, and 2) that current active commuting is not explained by
   unobserved characteristics that may be the true source of a lower body
   mass index (BMI).
   Methods
   Daily time-use diaries are used in combination with geographical
   characteristics of where respondents live and work to test 1) whether
   residents of more compact settlements are characterized by higher
   activity levels; and 2) whether residents of more compact settlements
   are more likely to bike or walk to work. An endogenous treatment model
   of active commuting allows testing whether reductions in BMI associated
   with walking or biking to work are in fact attributable to that activity
   or are more strongly associated with unobserved characteristics of these
   active commuters.
   Results
   The analysis of general activity levels confirms that residents of more
   compact cities do not expend more energy than residents of more
   sprawling cities, indicating that those in compact cities do not
   necessarily have a preference for more physical activity. The endogenous
   treatment model is consistent with walking or biking to work having an
   independent effect on BMI, as unobserved factors that contribute to a
   higher likelihood of active commuting are not associated with lower BMI.
   Conclusions
   Despite evidence that more compact settlement patterns enable active
   commuting, only a small share of workers in these areas choose to walk
   or bike to work. In general, the activity level of residents in more
   compact cities and residents in more sprawling areas is very similar.
   But, there is a robust association between active commuting and lower
   body mass index that is not explained by unobserved attributes or
   preferences suggests that policies to promote active commuting may be
   effective. In particular, active commuting has a greater effect on BMI.
   Consequently, compact settlement appears to be an effective
   infrastructure for promoting more active lifestyles. The policy
   challenge is finding ways to ensure that this infrastructure is more
   widely utilized.}},

Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{In St. Louis, as in many other cities, decline and displacement occurred
   when key policies, prejudices, and plans interacted with broad economic
   restructuring to devastate poor and minority communities, while leaving
   White and middle-class communities largely intact. Amidst overall
   population loss and neighborhood decline are pockets of prosperity and
   gentrification within the central city. In this article, we analyze
   three significant planning interventions in St. Louis, Missouri, that
   spurred displacement of populations-urban renewal, triage, and the
   foreclosure crisis. We argue that the differential experiences of Black
   and White during each of these periods represent two faces of
   development: one in the north of the city that is largely Black,
   experiencing vacant land, high crime, and crumbling infrastructure;
   another in the south of the city that is largely White, enjoying pockets
   of vibrant commercial development, larger homes, and stable real estate
   markets. We analyze each period through a framework of uneven and
   unequal development and displacement, which we call the Divergent City
   Theory. Based on this theory, planners face an ethical obligation to
   plan for the future of their cities in a way that seeks to reconcile the
   structured race and class inequalities of the divergent city.}},

Abstract = {{The European ``Smart Cities \& Communities Initiative{''} of the
   Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan) supports cities and regions
   in taking ambitious measures to progress by 2020 towards a 40\%
   reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through sustainable use and
   production of energy. This initiative aims to pool resources to support
   the demonstration of energy, transport and information and communication
   technologies in European urban areas. In this effort, the zero energy
   buildings (ZEB) are expected to play a crucial role.
   The main objective of this paper is to present the potential
   contribution of the ZEB principle towards achieving smart cities in
   Europe. In terms of this study, the evolution of building standards
   towards the ZEB concept will be presented, followed by discussions
   regarding the provisions of a SET-Plan smart city and the ZEB
   definition. Additionally, past studies discussing on the role of zero
   energy buildings in smart energy regions will also be reviewed. The
   conclusions of the analysis on the potential of ZEBs in SET-Plan smart
   cities will provide some useful insight towards the actions required in
   the building assessment methodologies' developments, in order to achieve
   the envisioned smart cities in Europe. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Contemporary cities are the scenes of sudden and numerous changes from
   social, economical and environmental points of view. The capability for
   cities to endorse, foster, enhance ongoing transformations and modern
   challenges is obstructed by the unsuitableness and lack of communication
   and integration of both material and immaterial infrastructures. The new
   vision of Smart Cities can fill these gaps, as it represents a balance
   among hardware and software aspects, technology and human capital, and
   it aims at realizing and guaranteeing the quality of life to the
   inhabitants.
   At today, there is absence of uniformity both in the definition and in
   the concept development of a Smart City, and there are not practical
   methodologies supporting the evaluation models developed in literature.
   The approach often does not appear as a holistic, complete and
   integrated, but as a combination of sector-based non communicating and
   non integrated actions. In this framework, the aim of this paper is to
   outline a planning methodology of actions to realize a Smart City that
   provides a holistic and specific approach to territories and cities by
   taking into account the specific features of the context and by
   developing different and appropriate strategies. According to this, a
   way to integrate the various aspects of a Smart City through the
   definition of the relations existing among all the subsystems of the
   city, considered as a whole (human) organism, has been developed. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose GeoRank, a geographic routing approach for the
   IPv6-enabled large-scale low-power and lossy networks. We discuss the
   main drawbacks of the RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy
   Networks) for P2P (point-to-point) communication in large-scale 6LoWPAN
   networks. Then, we address such drawbacks by proposing a routing
   protocol, named GeoRank, which integrates RPL protocol with the
   position-based routing protocol GOAFR (Greedy Other Adaptive Face
   Routing). The results obtained with simulations show that GeoRank finds
   shorter routes than RPL in high link density conditions and than GOAFR
   in low link density conditions. Thus, GeoRank shows to be adaptive to
   variable link densities found in large-scale networks. Further, GeoRank
   avoids the use of DAO (Destination Advertisement Object) control
   messages required in RPL, while being more scalable in terms of memory
   usage than storing-mode RPL. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Street lighting is a ubiquitous utility, but sustaining its operation
   presents a heavy financial and environmental burden. Many schemes have
   been proposed which selectively dim lights to improve energy efficiency,
   but little consideration has been given to the usefulness of the
   resultant street lighting system. This paper proposes a real-time
   adaptive lighting scheme, which detects the presence of vehicles and
   pedestrians and dynamically adjusts their brightness to the optimal
   level. This improves the energy efficiency of street lighting and its
   usefulness; a streetlight utility model is presented to evaluate this.
   The proposed scheme is simulated using an environment modelling a road
   network, its users, and a networked communication system - and considers
   a real streetlight topology from a residential area. The proposed scheme
   achieves similar or improved utility to existing schemes, while
   consuming as little as 1-2\% of the energy required by conventional and
   state-of-the-art techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks have been considered as an enabling technology
   for constructing smart cities. One important feature of wireless sensor
   networks is that the sensor nodes collaborate in some manner for
   communications. In this manuscript, we focus on the model of multiway
   relaying with full data exchange where each user wants to transmit and
   receive data to and from all other users in the network. We derive the
   capacity region for this specific model and propose a coding strategy
   through coset encoding. To obtain good performance with practical codes,
   we choose spatially-coupled LDPC (SC-LDPC) codes for the coded
   cooperation. In particular, for the message broadcasting from the relay,
   we construct multi-edge-type (MET) SC-LDPC codes by repeatedly applying
   coset encoding. Due to the capacity-achieving property of the SC-LDPC
   codes, we prove that the capacity region can theoretically be achieved
   by the proposed MET SC-LDPC codes. Numerical results with finite node
   degrees are provided, which show that the achievable rates approach the
   boundary of the capacity region in both binary erasure channels and
   additive white Gaussian channels.}},

Abstract = {{Smart parking is a typical IoT application that can benefit from
   advances in sensor, actuator and RFID technologies to provide many
   services to its users and parking owners of a smart city. This paper
   considers a smart parking infrastructure where sensors are laid down on
   the parking spots to detect car presence and RFID readers are embedded
   into parking gates to identify cars and help in the billing of the smart
   parking. Both types of devices are endowed with wired and wireless
   communication capabilities for reporting to a gateway where the
   situation recognition is performed. The sensor devices are tasked to
   play one of the three roles: (1) slave sensor nodes located on the
   parking spot to detect car presence/absence; (2) master nodes located at
   one of the edges of a parking lot to detect presence and collect the
   sensor readings from the slave nodes; and (3) repeater sensor nodes,
   also called anchor nodes, located strategically at specific locations in
   the parking lot to increase the coverage and connectivity of the
   wireless sensor network. While slave and master nodes are placed based
   on geographic constraints, the optimal placement of the relay/anchor
   sensor nodes in smart parking is an important parameter upon which the
   cost and efficiency of the parking system depends. We formulate the
   optimal placement of sensors in smart parking as an integer linear
   programming multi-objective problem optimizing the sensor network
   engineering efficiency in terms of coverage and lifetime maximization,
   as well as its economic gain in terms of the number of sensors deployed
   for a specific coverage and lifetime. We propose an exact solution to
   the node placement problem using single-step and two-step solutions
   implemented in the Mosel language based on the Xpress-MPsuite of
   libraries. Experimental results reveal the relative efficiency of the
   single-step compared to the two-step model on different performance
   parameters. These results are consolidated by simulation results, which
   reveal that our solution outperforms a random placement in terms of both
   energy consumption, delay and throughput achieved by a smart parking
   network.}},

Abstract = {{Mobility management represents one of the most important parts of the
   smart city concept. The way we travel, at what time of the day, for what
   purposes and with what transportation modes, have a pertinent impact on
   the overall quality of life in cities. To manage this process, detailed
   and comprehensive information on individuals' behaviour is needed as
   well as effective feedback/communication channels. In this article, we
   explore the applicability of crowdsourced data for this purpose. We
   apply a gradient boosting trees algorithm to model individuals' mobility
   decision making processes (particularly concerning what transportation
   mode they are likely to use). To accomplish this we rely on data
   collected from three sources: a dedicated smartphone application, a
   geographic information systems-based web interface and weather forecast

Abstract = {{Smart cities are expected to improve the quality of life of citizens by
   relying on new paradigms, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and its
   capacity to manage and interconnect thousands of sensors and actuators
   scattered across the city. At the same time, mobile devices widely
   assist professional and personal everyday activities. A very good
   example of the potential of these devices for smart cities is their
   powerful support for intuitive service interfaces (such as those based
   on augmented reality (AR)) for non-expert users. In our work, we
   consider a scenario that combines IoT and AR within a smart city
   maintenance service to improve the accessibility of sensor and actuator
   devices in the field, where responsiveness is crucial. In it, depending
   on the location and needs of each service, data and commands will be
   transported by an urban communications network or consulted on the spot.
   Direct AR interaction with urban objects has already been described; it
   usually relies on 2D visual codes to deliver object identifiers (IDs) to
   the rendering device to identify object resources. These IDs allow
   information about the objects to be retrieved from a remote server. In
   this work, we present a novel solution that replaces static AR markers
   with dynamic markers based on LED communication, which can be decoded
   through cameras embedded in smartphones. These dynamic markers can
   directly deliver sensor information to the rendering device, on top of
   the object ID, without further network interaction.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of embedded systems, mobile devices and other smart devices
   keeps rising globally, and the scope of their involvement broadens, for
   instance, in smart city-like scenarios. In light of this, a pressing
   need emerges to tame such complexity and reuse as much tooling as
   possible without resorting to vertical ad hoc solutions, while at the
   same time taking into account valid options with regard to
   infrastructure management and other more advanced functionalities.
   Existing solutions mainly focus on core mechanisms and do not allow one
   to scale by leveraging infrastructure or adapt to a variety of
   scenarios, especially if actuators are involved in the loop. A new, more
   flexible, cloud-based approach, able to provide device-focused
   workflows, is required. In this sense, a widely-used and competitive
   framework for infrastructure as a service, such as OpenStack, with its
   breadth in terms of feature coverage and expanded scope, looks to fit
   the bill, replacing current application-specific approaches with an
   innovative application-agnostic one. This work thus describes the
   rationale, efforts and results so far achieved for an integration of IoT
   paradigms and resource ecosystems with such a kind of cloud-oriented
   device-centric environment, by focusing on a smart city scenario, namely
   a park smart lighting example, and featuring data collection, data
   visualization, event detection and coordinated reaction, as example use
   cases of such integration.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we critically discuss the challenge of integrating
   contextual information, in particular spatiotemporal contextual
   information, with human and technical sensor information, which we
   approach from a geospatial perspective. We start by highlighting the
   significance of context in general and spatiotemporal context in
   particular and introduce a smart city model of interactions between
   humans, the environment, and technology, with context at the common
   interface. We then focus on both the intentional and the unintentional
   sensing capabilities of today's technologies and discuss current
   technological trends that we consider have the ability to enrich human
   and technical geo-sensor information with contextual detail. The
   different types of sensors used to collect contextual information are
   analyzed and sorted into three groups on the basis of names considering
   frequently used related terms, and characteristic contextual parameters.
   These three groups, namely technical in situ sensors, technical remote
   sensors, and human sensors are analyzed and linked to three dimensions
   involved in sensing (data generation, geographic phenomena, and type of
   sensing). In contrast to other scientific publications, we found a large
   number of technologies and applications using in situ and mobile
   technical sensors within the context of smart cities, and surprisingly
   limited use of remote sensing approaches. In this article we further
   provide a critical discussion of possible impacts and influences of both
   technical and human sensing approaches on society, pointing out that a
   larger number of sensors, increased fusion of information, and the use
   of standardized data formats and interfaces will not necessarily result
   in any improvement in the quality of life of the citizens of a smart
   city. This article seeks to improve our understanding of technical and
   human geo-sensing capabilities, and to demonstrate that the use of such
   sensors can facilitate the integration of different types of contextual
   information, thus providing an additional, namely the geo-spatial
   perspective on the future development of smart cities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers situations in which a team of mobile sensor
   platforms autonomously explores an environment to detect and localize an
   unknown number of targets. Individual sensors may be unreliable, failing
   to detect objects within the field-of-view, returning false positive
   measurements to clutter objects, and being unable to disambiguate true
   targets. In this setting, data association is difficult. We utilize the
   PHD filter for multitarget localization, simultaneously estimating the
   number of objects and their locations within the environment without the
   need to explicitly consider data association. Using sets of potential
   actions generated at multiple length scales for each robot, the team
   selects the joint action that maximizes the expected information gain
   over a finite time horizon. This is computed as the mutual information
   between the set of targets and the binary events of receiving no
   detections, effectively hedging against uninformative actions in a
   computationally tractable manner. We frame the controller as a
   receding-horizon problem. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of
   the proposed autonomous exploration strategy through hardware
   experiments, exploring an office environment with a team of ground
   robots. We also conduct a series of simulated experiments, varying the
   planning method, target cardinality, environment, and sensor modality.
   Note to Practitioners-Teams of small robots have the potential to
   automate many information gathering tasks, relaying data back to a base
   station or human operator from multiple vantage points within an
   environment. The information gathering tasks we consider in this work
   are those in which the number of objects being sought is not known at
   the onset of exploration. Such tasks are common in security and
   surveillance, where the number of such objects is often zero; search and
   rescue, where, for example, the number of people trapped due to a
   natural disaster can be large; or smart building/smart city
   applications, where the data collection needs may be on an even larger
   scale. This paper seeks to address the problem of automating this data
   collection process, so that a team of mobile sensor platforms are able
   to autonomously explore a given environment in order to determine the
   number of objects of interest and their locations, while avoiding any
   explicit data association, i.e., matching individual measurements to
   targets.}},

Abstract = {{Personal security is an open problem in large cities. After several
   attempts to reduce violence and crime, there seems to be an agreement
   that preventive actions are the best way to address this problem. Trying
   to help deal with that challenge, this paper proposes a mobile
   collaborative application, named Personal Guardian, which is used by
   civilians while walking in urban areas. The application is focused on
   crime prevention and it implements participatory sensing to help people
   be aware of the risks that appear to exist in a certain place at a
   certain time. Based on that information, citizens can take appropriate
   and on-time preventive actions. The system is supported by a
   human-centric wireless sensor network, and it is complementary to the
   security solutions already used by public and private organizations. The
   system architecture and its main components are described, and the main
   requirements and design decisions are also discussed. A preliminary
   evaluation of the solution was conducted to determine its strengths and
   weaknesses in terms of quality of service. The obtained results indicate
   that the information feeding process is more relevant for end-users than

Abstract = {{Measuring urban crime is a well-established practice for many police
   forces, local governments and public administrations all over the world.
   There seems to be, however, a large gap between the rigorous academic
   definition of how crime indicators should be calculated and interpreted
   and the actual use that is made of them. Crime counts and rates are
   unadvisedly put out with little effort to clarify their different
   meaning; population-based crime rates remain a standard measure despite
   quite compelling arguments against the use of population as an offset
   for cross-sectional comparisons; most importantly, little attention
   seems to have been paid to the consequences of formulating preventive
   policies based on poorly defined and understood indicators. This issue
   looks even more evident with high-definition indicators that detail the
   levels of crime for very small statistical units (streets, street
   segments and blocks) with situational interventions in mind. After a
   review of the literature, we illustrate, through a case study, the
   different landscapes of urban safety and risk of crime when five
   different families of indicators are alternatively used: crime counts,
   population-based crime rates, risk-based crime rates, crime density and
   location quotients. We propose a multi-indicator approach to the ranking
   and prioritization of urban security issues based on partial order
   scalogram analysis by coordinates that presents substantial advantages
   as an operational tool for Public Administrations in a Smart Cities
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{We proposed and developed a taxi-sharing system that accepts taxi
   passengers' real-time ride requests sent from smartphones and schedules
   proper taxis to pick up them via ridesharing, subject to time, capacity,
   and monetary constraints. The monetary constraints provide incentives
   for both passengers and taxi drivers: passengers will not pay more
   compared with no ridesharing and get compensated if their travel time is
   lengthened due to ridesharing; taxi drivers will make money for all the
   detour distance due to ridesharing. While such a system is of
   significant social and environmental benefit, e. g., saving energy
   consumption and satisfying people's commute, real-time taxi-sharing has
   not been well studied yet. To this end, we devise a mobile-cloud
   architecture based taxi-sharing system. Taxi riders and taxi drivers use
   the taxi-sharing service provided by the system via a smart phone App.
   The Cloud first finds candidate taxis quickly for a taxi ride request
   using a taxi searching algorithm supported by a spatio-temporal index. A
   scheduling process is then performed in the cloud to select a taxi that
   satisfies the request with minimum increase in travel distance. We built
   an experimental platform using the GPS trajectories generated by over
   33,000 taxis over a period of three months. A ride request generator is
   developed (available at http://cs.uic.edu/similar to sma/ridesharing) in
   terms of the stochastic process modelling real ride requests learned
   from the data set. Tested on this platform with extensive experiments,
   our proposed system demonstrated its efficiency, effectiveness and
   scalability. For example, when the ratio of the number of ride requests
   to the number of taxis is 6, our proposed system serves three times as
   many taxi riders as that when no ridesharing is performed while saving
   11 percent in total travel distance and 7 percent taxi fare per rider.}},

Abstract = {{Substantive and concerted action is needed to mitigate climate change.
   However, international negotiations struggle to adopt ambitious
   legislation and to anticipate more climate-friendly developments. Thus,
   stronger actions are needed from other players. Cities, being greenhouse
   gas emission centers, play a key role in promoting the climate change
   mitigation movement by becoming hubs for smart and low-carbon
   lifestyles. In this context, a stronger linkage between greenhouse gas
   emissions and urban development and policy-making seems promising.
   Therefore, simple approaches are needed to objectively identify crucial
   emission drivers for deriving appropriate emission reduction strategies.
   In analyzing 44 European cities, the authors investigate possible
   socioeconomic and spatial determinants of urban greenhouse gas
   emissions. Multiple statistical analyses reveal that the average
   household size and the edge density of discontinuous dense urban fabric
   explain up to 86\% of the total variance of greenhouse gas emissions of
   EU cities (when controlled for varying electricity carbon intensities).
   Finally, based on these findings, a multiple regression model is
   presented to determine greenhouse gas emissions. It is independently
   evaluated with ten further EU cities. The reliance on only two
   indicators shows that the model can be easily applied in addressing
   important greenhouse gas emission sources of European urbanites, when
   varying power generations are considered. This knowledge can help cities
   develop adequate climate change mitigation strategies and promote
   respective policies on the EU or the regional level. The results can
   further be used to derive first estimates of urban greenhouse gas
   emissions, if no other analyses are available. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Abstract
   This paper introduces indicators of regional related variety and
   unrelated variety to conceptually overcome the current impasse in the
   specialization-diversity debate in agglomeration economics. Although
   various country-level studies have been published on this
   conceptualization in recent years, a pan-European test has been missing
   from the literature until now. A pan-European test is more interesting
   than country-level tests, as newly defined cohesion policies,
   smart-specialization policies, place-based development strategies and
   competitiveness policies may be especially served by related variety and
   unrelated variety conceptualizations. We test empirically for the
   significance of variables based on these concepts, using a
   cross-sectional data set for 205 European regions during the period
   2000-2010. The results confirming our hypotheses are that related
   variety is significantly related to employment growth, especially in
   small and medium-sized city-regions, and that specialization is
   significantly related to productivity growth. We do not find robust
   relationships that are hypothesized between unrelated variety and
   unemployment growth.}},

Abstract = {{VANET is one of the most important parts in smart cities. However,
   heterogeneous network devices used by different vehicles make data
   exchange among vehicles become particularly difficult. To solve the
   problem, a distributed service sharing middleware for VANET called
   VssOSGi is proposed in the paper. In this middleware, various kinds of
   functions provided by sensing devices in vehicles are virtually
   abstracted as services in the network, which decouples applications from
   devices and provides a unified platform for data exchange among
   vehicles. As the movements of cars lead to dynamic changes of the
   network topology, the service discoveries for these vehicles are easily
   to be invalidated. The paper proposes a distributed service directory
   selection algorithm SSWA (Stability and Sharing-oriented Weight-based
   Algorithm) and introduces a service discovery mechanism to make service
   discoveries for vehicles more effectively and timely. The simulation
   results show that the proposed middleware could realize widely service
   discoveries in VANET. Moreover, it requires shorter service response
   time and less communication traffic with the growing amount of vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Whilst there is an increasing capability to instrument smart cities
   using fixed and mobile sensors to produce the big data to better
   understand and manage transportation use, there still exists a wide gap
   between the sustainability goals of smart cities, e.g., to promote less
   private car use at peak times, with respect to their ability to more
   dynamically support individualised shifts in multi-modal transportation
   use to help achieve such goals. We describe the development of the
   tripzoom system developed as part of the SUNSET-SUstainable social
   Network SErvices for Transport-project to research and develop a mobile
   and fixed traffic sensor system to help facilitate individual mobility
   shifts. Its main novelty was its ability to use mobile sensors to
   classify common multiple urban transportation modes, to generate
   information-rich individual and group mobility profiles and to couple
   this with the use of a targeted incentivised marketplace to gamify
   travel. This helps to promote mobility shifts towards achieving
   sustainability goals. This system was trialled in three European country
   cities operated as Living Labs over six months. Our main findings were
   that we were able to accomplish a level of behavioural shifts in travel
   behaviour. Hence, we have provided a proof-of-concept system that uses
   positive incentives to change individual travel behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Information Technology and Communications (ICT) is presented as the main
   element in order to achieve more efficient and sustainable city resource
   management, while making sure that the needs of the citizens to improve
   their quality of life are satisfied. A key element will be the creation
   of new systems that allow the acquisition of context information,
   automatically and transparently, in order to provide it to decision
   support systems. In this paper, we present a novel distributed system
   for obtaining, representing and providing the flow and movement of
   people in densely populated geographical areas. In order to accomplish
   these tasks, we propose the design of a smart sensor network based on
   RFID communication technologies, reliability patterns and integration
   techniques. Contrary to other proposals, this system represents a
   comprehensive solution that permits the acquisition of user information
   in a transparent and reliable way in a non-controlled and heterogeneous
   environment. This knowledge will be useful in moving towards the design
   of smart cities in which decision support on transport strategies,
   business evaluation or initiatives in the tourism sector will be
   supported by real relevant information. As a final result, a case study
   will be presented which will allow the validation of the proposal.}},

Abstract = {{The development of smart cities has been the epicentre of many
   researchers' efforts during the past decade. One of the key requirements
   for smart city networks is mobility and this is the reason stable,
   reliable and high-quality wireless communications are needed in order to
   connect people and devices. Most research efforts so far, have used
   different kinds of wireless and sensor networks, making interoperability
   rather difficult to accomplish in smart cities. One common solution
   proposed in the recent literature is the use of software defined
   networks (SDNs), in order to enhance interoperability among the various
   heterogeneous wireless networks. In addition, SDNs can take advantage of
   the data retrieved from available sensors and use them as part of the
   intelligent decision making process contacted during the resource
   allocation procedure. In this paper, we propose an architecture
   combining heterogeneous wireless networks with social networks using
   SDNs. Specifically, we exploit the information retrieved from location
   based social networks regarding users' locations and we attempt to
   predict areas that will be crowded by using specially-designed machine
   learning techniques. By recognizing possible crowded areas, we can
   provide mobile operators with recommendations about areas requiring
   datacell activation or deactivation.}},

Abstract = {{Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) integrate information, sensor,
   control, and communication technologies to provide transport related
   services. Their users range from everyday commuters to policy makers and
   urban planners. Given the complexity of these systems and their
   environment, their study in real settings is frequently unfeasible.
   Simulations help to address this problem, but present their own issues:
   there can be unintended mistakes in the transition from models to code;
   their platforms frequently bias modeling; and it is difficult to compare
   works that use different models and tools. In order to overcome these
   problems, this paper proposes a framework for a model-driven development
   of these simulations. It is based on a specific modeling language that
   supports the integrated specification of the multiple facets of an ITS:
   people, their vehicles, and the external environment; and a network of
   sensors and actuators conveniently arranged and distributed that
   operates over them. The framework works with a model editor to generate
   specifications compliant with that language, and a code generator to
   produce code from them using platform specifications. There are also
   guidelines to help researchers in the application of this
   infrastructure. A case study on advanced management of traffic lights
   with cameras illustrates its use.}},

   the concept of Smart Signal, as a device conscious of its context, with

   a ubiquitous element that contributes with information to the city. We
   present the design considerations and a real implementation and
   validation of the system in one of the most challenging environments

   offers a comparative analysis of ten smart cities in China on the basis
   of an extensive database covering two time periods: 2005-2007 and
   2008-2010. The unsupervised computational neural network self-organizing
   map (SOM) analysis is adopted to map out the various cities based on
   their performance. The demonstration effect and mutual influences
   between these ten smart cities are also discussed by using social
   network analysis. Based on the smart city performance and cluster

Abstract = {{Objective: Little is known about the use of Stress Management and
   Relaxation Techniques (SMART) in racially diverse inpatients. We hope to
   identify socioeconomic status (SES) factors, health behavior factors,
   and clinical factors associated with the use of SMART.
   Design and main outcome measures: We conducted a secondary analysis of
   baseline data from 623 hospitalized patients enrolled in the
   Re-Engineered Discharge (RED) clinical trial. We assessed
   socio-demographic characteristics and use of SMART. We used bivariate
   and multivariate logistic regression to test the association of SMART
   with socio-demographic characteristics, health behaviors, and clinical
   factors.
   Results: A total of 26.6\% of participants reported using SMART and
   23.6\% used mind body techniques. Thirty six percent of work disabled
   patients, 39\% of illicit drug users, and 38\% of participants with
   depressive symptoms used SMART. Patients who both reported illicit drug
   use and screened positive for depression had significantly increased
   odds of using SMART {[}OR=4.94, 95\% Cl (1.59, 15.13)]. Compared to
   non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks {[}0.55 (0.34-0.87)] and
   Hispanic/other race individuals {[}0.40 (0.20-0.76)] were less likely to
   use SMART.
   Conclusions: We found greater utilization of SMART among all racial
   groups compared to previous national studies. In the inner city
   inpatient setting, patients with depression, illicit drug use, and work
   disability reported higher rates of using SMART. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This article presents the enviroCar platform for collecting geographic
   data acquired from automobile sensors and openly providing those data
   for further processing and analysis. By plugging a low-cost On-Board
   Diagnostics (OBD-II) adapter into a car and using an Android smartphone,
   various kinds of sensor data measured by today's cars can be collected
   and uploaded on to the Web. Once available on the Web, these data can be
   used to monitor traffic and related environmental parameters. We analyse
   the OBD-II interface and its potential usage for environmental
   monitoring, e.g. to estimate fuel consumption and resulting CO2
   emissions, noise emission, and standing times. Next, we present the main
   contribution of this article, the system design of the enviroCar
   platform. This system design consists of the enviroCar app and the
   enviroCar server, which allows for flexible geoprocessing of the
   uploaded data. We focus in this article on the description of the
   spatiotemporal RESTful Web Service interface and underlying data model
   specifically designed for handling the mobile sensor data. Finally, we
   present application scenarios in which the enviroCar platform can act as
   a powerful tool, e.g. regarding traffic monitoring and smarter cities
   (e.g. the detection of pollutant emission hotspots in the city), or
   towards applications for a quantified self (e.g. monitoring fuel
   consumption). We started the enviroCar project in 2013 and have been
   able to attract a growing number of participants since then. In a
   crowd-funding initiative, enviroCar was successfully funded by
   volunteers, demonstrating the interest in this platform.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in
   outpatients of Chinese county hospitals. A total of 31 county hospitals
   were selected and samples continuously collected from August 2010 to
   August 2011. Drug sensitivity testing was conducted in a central
   laboratory. A total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including
   634 strains of Escherichia coli, 606 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 476
   Staphylococcus aureus, 308 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 Haemophilus
   influenzae. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in E. coli
   (42.3\% strains), K. pneumoniae (31.7\%), and Proteus mirabilis
   (39.0\%). Ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0\% of E. coil
   strains. Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were sensitive to most
   antibacterial agents. Less than 8.0\% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates
   were resistant to carbapenem. For S. aureus strains, 15.3\% were
   resistant to methicillin, and some strains of S. pneumoniae showed
   resistance to penicillin (1.6\%), ceftriaxone (13.0\%), and erythromycin
   (96.4\%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5\% of Moraxella catarrhalis
   strains, and 36.2\% of H. influenzae isolates were resistant to
   ampicillin. Azithromycin-resistant H. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but
   meropenem-sensitive Proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem
   non-sensitive M. catarrhalis were recorded. In conclusion,
   cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant strains of E. coli and Klebsiella
   pneumonia and macrolide-resistant Gram-positive cocci were relatively
   prominent in county hospitals. The antibacterial resistance profiles of
   isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly,
   with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary
   counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is
   diminishing. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Until recently crowdsourcing has been primarily conceived as an online
   activity to harness resources for problem solving. However, the
   emergence of Opportunistic Networking (ON) has opened up crowdsourcing
   to the spatial domain. In this article, we bring the ON model for
   potential crowdsourcing in the smart city environment. We introduce
   cognitive features of the ON that allow users' mobile devices to become
   aware of the surrounding physical environment. Specifically, we exploit
   cognitive psychology studies on dynamic memory structures and cognitive
   heuristics-mental models that describe how the human brain handles
   decision making among complex and real-time stimuli. Combined with ON,
   these cognitive features allow devices to act as proxies in their users'
   cyberworlds and exchange knowledge to deliver awareness of places in an
   urban environment. This is done through tags associated with locations.
   They represent features that are perceived by humans about a place. We
   consider the extent to which this knowledge becomes available to
   participants using interactions with locations and other nodes. This is
   assessed taking into account a wide range of cognitive parameters.
   Outcomes are important because this functionality could support a new
   type of recommendation system that is independent of the traditional
   forms of networking.}},

Journal = {{FUTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City (SSTEC) in China was designed to
   leverage Singaporean expertise in top-down city planning, systematic
   management, and water treatment technologies and act as a replicable
   hub-and-spoke model. This study shows that an expansion of the scale of
   urbanization, and its transformation into the focal point of the
   hub-and-spoke eco-city model will enable China to advance as an
   international pioneer, by the creation of a new socio-technical regime
   dependent on green and ecologically sustainable systems. In particular,
   the potential capacity of China's new socio-technical regime, built on
   eco-cities, is based on its capability to (1) create a vision for a
   smart energy system; (2) drive down the cost of renewable energy
   equipment and devices; (3) support local industrial clusters for
   socio-economic development; (4) implement effective policies for
   city-level solutions; and (5) standardize and replicate these strategies
   in the new regime as a whole. In the top-down landscape approach, the
   public authority's integrated administrative capability and capacity is
   important as a means by which to link the various types of stakeholders.
   This has to be done, in the process of managing a city's transition and
   reducing the risk of transformational failure, by reinforcing the four
   types of capital assets - namely manufacturing capital, natural capital,
   human capital, and social capital. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The particular political, economic and social conditions of the state of
   Cuba, in the Caribbean, have created unique possibilities for the
   development of a sustainable transport system in its capital city,
   Havana. This paper reports on the outcomes of a project to identify the
   possibilities and priorities for a long-term strategy for equitable and
   sustainable mobility for Havana. This involved almost 100 participants
   from Cuba and the UK in the 12 months from June 2013.
   Overall, the study found a high degree of agreement amongst the
   transport policy community as to the three key transport issues facing
   Havana:
   high level of unmet demand,
   lack of available financing,
   poor state of the transport system.
   Perhaps more surprisingly, it also produced a near consensus amongst the
   participants that any future policy should seek to increase the quality
   of the public transport system by:
   increasing levels of investment,
   securing efficiency savings,
   working `smarter'.
   However, it also found that this unified view is challenged by a desire
   for the car market to be deregulated, which would engender a very
   different policy approach. A strategic choice is needed now, to
   determine whether Havana follows a North American-style trajectory of
   rapid growth in car use or a less car-dependent pathway. (C) 2015 The

   the numbers of doctors and beds of each study area were collected from
   the Korean Statistical Information Services in 2010. Map data and study
   variables were imported into a geographic information system and used
   for the ordinary least squares regression and geographically weighted
   regression analysis. The results indicated that most of the

Abstract = {{Due to the fact that electric vehicles have not broadly entered the
   vehicle market there are many attempts to convince producers to
   integrate technologies that utilise embedded batteries for purposes
   different from driving. The vehicle-to-grid technology, for instance,
   literally turns electric vehicles into a mobile battery, enabling new
   areas of applications (e.g., to provide regulatory energy, to do
   grid-load balancing, or to buffer surpluses of energy) and business
   perspectives. Utilising a vehicle's battery, however is not without a
   price-in this case: the driver's mobility. Given this dependency, it is
   interesting that most available works consider the application of
   electric vehicles for energy and grid-related problems in isolation,
   that is, detached from mobility-related issues. The distributed
   artificial intelligence laboratory, or DAI-Lab, is a third-party funded
   research lab at Technische Universitat Berlin and integrates the chair
   for agent technologies in business applications and telecommunication.
   The DAI-Lab has engaged in a large number of both, past and upcoming
   projects concerned with two aspects of managing electric vehicles,
   namely: energy and mobility. This article aims to summarise experiences
   that were collected during the last years and to present developed
   solutions which consider energy and mobility-related problems jointly.}},

Abstract = {{With the prevalence of GPS-enabled smart phones, Location Based Social
   Network (LBSN) has emerged and become a hot research topic during the
   past few years. As one of the most important components in LBSN,
   Points-of-Interests (POIs) has been extensively studied by both academia
   and industry, yielding POI recommendations to enhance user experience in
   exploring the city. In conventional methods, rating vectors for both
   users and POIs are utilized for similarity calculation, which might
   yield inaccuracy due to the differences of user biases. In our opinion,
   the rating values themselves do not give exact preferences of users,
   however the numeric order of ratings given by a user within a certain
   period provides a hint of preference order of POIs by such user.
   Firstly, we propose an approach to model users preference by employing
   utility theory. Secondly, We devise a collection-wise learning method
   over partial orders through an effective stochastic gradient descent
   algorithm. We test our model on two real world datasets, i.e., Yelp and
   TripAdvisor, by comparing with some state-of-the-art approaches
   including PMF and several user preference modeling methods. In terms of
   MAP and Recall, we averagely achieve 15\% improvement with regard to the
   baseline methods. The results show the significance of comparative
   choice in a certain time window and show its superiority to the existing
   methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a multi-mode parallel hybrid power-train so called
   clutchless geared smart transmission (CGST), is proposed and assessed in
   terms of the fuel economy. The use of a single motor/generator and a
   planetary gear enables the CGST to provide remarkable flexibility with
   four operational modes including the parallel hybrid mode. Based on its
   novel configuration, a fuel consumption model is newly developed and
   simulated to analyze the fuel economy of the CGST. The performance of
   the CGST is compared with those of the power-split hybrid system and the
   conventional manual transmission in city and highway cycles. The CGST
   shows the best efficiency in highway driving by reducing the unnecessary
   energy loss from the electric motor. Moreover, thanks to
   brake-regeneration and efficient engine operation with the specific
   operational modes, the fuel economy in the city cycle is comparable to
   that of the power-split hybrid system even though the CGST uses just a
   single electric motor.}},

Title = {{Longitudinal active living research to address physical inactivity and
   sedentary behaviour in children in transition from preadolescence to
   adolescence}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAY 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Children can be highly active and highly sedentary on the
   same day! For instance, a child can spend a couple of hours playing
   sports, and then spend the rest of the day in front of a screen. A focus
   on examining both physical activity and sedentary behaviour throughout
   the day and in all seasons in a year is necessary to generate
   comprehensive evidence to curb childhood obesity. To achieve this, we
   need to understand where within a city are children active or sedentary
   in all seasons. This active living study based in Saskatoon, Canada,
   aims to understand the role played by modifiable urban built
   environments in mitigating, or exacerbating, seasonal effects on
   children's physical activity and sedentary behaviour in a population of
   children in transition from preadolescence to adolescence.
   Methods/Design: Designed as an observational, longitudinal investigation
   this study will recruit 800 Canadian children 10-14 years of age. Data
   will be obtained from children representing all socioeconomic categories
   within all types of neighbourhoods built in a range of urban designs.
   Built environment characteristics will be measured using previously
   validated neighbourhood audit and observational tools. Neighbourhood
   level socioeconomic variables customized to Saskatoon neighbourhoods
   from 2011 Statistics Canada's National Household Survey will be used to
   control for neighbourhood social environment. The validated Smart Cities
   Healthy Kids questionnaire will be administered to capture children's
   behaviour and perception of a range of factors that influence their
   activity, household (including family socioeconomic factors), parental,
   peer and neighbourhood influence on independent mobility. The outcome
   measures, different intensities of physical activity and sedentary
   behaviour, will be collected using global positioning system equipped
   accelerometers in all four seasons. Each accelerometry cycle will be
   matched with weather data obtained from Environment Canada. Extensive
   weather data will be accessed and classified into one of six distinct
   air mass categories for each day of accelerometry. Computational and
   spatial analytical techniques will be utilized to understand the
   multi-level influence of environmental exposures on physical activity
   and sedentary behaviour in all seasons.
   Discussion: This approach will help us understand the influence of urban
   environment on children's activity, thus paving the way to modify urban
   spaces to increase physical activity and decrease sedentary behaviour in
   children in all four seasons. Lack of physical activity and rising
   sedentariness is associated with rising childhood obesity, and childhood
   obesity in turn is linked to many chronic conditions over the life
   course. Understanding the interaction of children with urban spaces will
   reveal new knowledge, and when translated to actions will provide a
   strong basis for informing future urban planning policy.}},

Abstract = {{Public transportation systems are an essential component of major
   cities. The widespread use of smart cards for automated fare collection
   in these systems offers a unique opportunity to understand passenger
   behavior at a massive scale. In this study, we use network-wide data
   obtained from smart cards in the London transport system to predict
   future traffic volumes, and to estimate the effects of disruptions due
   to unplanned closures of stations or lines. Disruptions, or shocks,
   force passengers to make different decisions concerning which stations
   to enter or exit We describe how these changes in passenger behavior
   lead to possible overcrowding and model how stations will be affected by
   given disruptions. This information can then be used to mitigate the
   effects of these shocks because transport authorities may prepare in
   advance alternative solutions such as additional buses near the most
   affected stations. We describe statistical methods that leverage the
   large amount of smart-card data collected under the natural state of the
   system, where no shocks take place, as variables that are indicative of
   behavior under disruptions. We find that features extracted from the
   natural regime data can be successfully exploited to describe different
   disruption regimes, and that our framework can be used as a general tool
   for any similar complex transportation system.}},

Abstract = {{Mapping drinking water flow is a real challenge not only to detect water
   leaks but also to control the quality of the water. In France, 900,000
   km of water pipe serves 99\% of the population. A recent law imposes the
   mapping of these pipelines on a known geographical system with a planar
   positional accuracy from 0.4 to 1.5 m according to the age and type of
   the pipeline. Wireless sensors and models based on computational fluid
   mechanics (CFD) allow to study flow and to reconstruct parameters such
   as velocity, pressure and a chemical concentration at each point. This
   information can be used to detect leaks and to control the concentration
   of chlorine or other chemical products. However, this information is not
   easy to map on GIS due to the small width of water pipe and the very
   high quantity of points necessary for data flow computation. In this
   research work, we propose solutions to map this information at different
   levels of detail with other information such as roads and buildings. We
   first propose to use area symbols instead of punctual symbols to improve
   zoom-in visual effects. We also propose to generalize initial water data
   for zoom-out processes. We use the axis of the water pipe as basic
   geometry and we segment it. We then compute a generalized value of
   pressure, velocity or chemical concentration for each segment with
   specific function adapted to the property we wish to study. We propose a
   conceptual data schema that describes the required information to map
   this data at different levels of detail. The solution has been fully
   implemented on experimental data and illustrated by means of a dedicated
   web mapping that proposes a set of GIS functions such as the selection
   of the data, zooming functions but also the animation to see the
   propagation of a chemical product in the water pipe.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the rapid advancements in consumer electronics, the data
   transmitted by sensing devices in a smart home environment are still
   vulnerable to anomalies due to node faults, transmission errors, or
   attacks. This affects the reliability of the received sensed data and
   may lead to the incorrect decision making at both local (i.e., smart
   home) and global (i.e., smart city) levels. This study introduces a
   novel mobile agent-based cross-layer anomaly detection scheme, which
   takes into account stochastic variability in cross-layer data obtained
   from received data packets, and defines fuzzy logic-based soft
   boundaries to characterize behavior of sensor nodes. This cross-layer
   design approach empowers the proposed scheme to detect both node and
   link anomalies, and also effectively transmits mobile agents by
   considering the communication link-state before transmission of the
   mobile agent. The proposed scheme is implemented on a real testbed and a
   modular application software is developed to manage the anomaly
   detection system in the smart home. The experimental results show that
   the proposed scheme detects cross-layer anomalies with high accuracy and
   considerably reduces the energy consumption caused by the mobile agent
   transmission in the poor communication link-state situations(1).}},

Abstract = {{A smart grid is one of the most important applications in smart cities.
   In a smart grid, a smart meter acts as a sensor node in a sensor
   network, and a central device collects power usage from every smart
   meter. This paper focuses on a centralized data collection problem of
   how to collect every power usage from every meter without collisions in
   an environment in which the time synchronization among smart meters is
   not guaranteed. To solve the problem, we divide a tree that a sensor
   network constructs into several branches. A conflict-free query schedule
   is generated based on the branches. Each power usage is collected
   according to the schedule. The proposed method has important features:
   shortening query processing time and avoiding collisions between a query
   and query responses. We evaluate this method using the ns-2 simulator.
   The experimental results show that this method can achieve both
   collision avoidance and fast query processing at the same time. The
   success rate of data collection at a sink node executing this method is
   100\%. Its running time is about 35 percent faster than that of the
   round-robin method, and its memory size is reduced to about 10\% of that
   of the depth-first search method.}},

Abstract = {{Smart homes for the aging population have recently started attracting
   the attention of the research community. The health state of smart homes
   is comprised of many different levels; starting with the physical health
   of citizens, it also includes longer-term health norms and outcomes, as
   well as the arena of positive behavior changes. One of the problems of
   interest is to monitor the activities of daily living (ADL) of the
   elderly, aiming at their protection and well-being. For this purpose, we
   installed passive infrared (PIR) sensors to detect motion in a specific
   area inside a smart apartment and used them to collect a set of ADL. In
   a novel approach, we describe a technology that allows the ground truth
   collected in one smart home to train activity recognition systems for
   other smart homes. We asked the users to label all instances of all ADL
   only once and subsequently applied data mining techniques to cluster
   in-home sensor firings. Each cluster would therefore represent the
   instances of the same activity. Once the clusters were associated to
   their corresponding activities, our system was able to recognize future
   activities. To improve the activity recognition accuracy, our system
   preprocessed raw sensor data by identifying overlapping activities. To
   evaluate the recognition performance from a 200-day dataset, we
   implemented three different active learning classification algorithms
   and compared their performance: naive Bayesian (NB), support vector
   machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Based on our results, the RF
   classifier recognized activities with an average specificity of 96.53\%,
   a sensitivity of 68.49\%, a precision of 74.41\% and an F-measure of
   71.33\%, outperforming both the NB and SVM classifiers. Further
   clustering markedly improved the results of the RF classifier. An
   activity recognition system based on PIR sensors in conjunction with a
   clustering classification approach was able to detect ADL from datasets
   collected from different homes. Thus, our PIR-based smart home
   technology could improve care and provide valuable information to better
   understand the functioning of our societies, as well as to inform both
   individual and collective action in a smart city scenario.}},

Abstract = {{This article introduces a theoretical framework for the analysis of
   business models that involve public actors, and city governments in
   particular, in the value network. It starts from an established business
   model framework and expands it to include an additional set of
   indicators required to successfully perform a qualitative analysis of
   the business models of new (digital) services offered by cities. It then
   applies this framework to several divergent cases from the mobile
   services sector in which city governments are involved as part of their
   efforts in becoming ``smarter cities{''}. By weighing the indicators for
   each case study, we can create a grid that allows for their direct
   comparison and gives an indication of diverging strategies. The newly
   introduced structured framework and its qualitative indicators are the
   main contribution of this work and can be used to set out or evaluate
   smart city strategies on a meso-level, as part of a broader policy
   exercise within cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{These days, transportation and logistic problems in large cities are
   demanding smarter transportation services that provide flexibility and
   adaptability. A possible solution to this arising problem is to compute
   the best routes for each new scenario. In this problem, known in the
   literature as the dial-a-ride problem, a number of passengers are
   transported between pickup and delivery locations trying to minimize the
   routing costs while respecting a set of prespecified constraints. This
   problem has been solved in the literature with several approaches from
   small to medium sized problems. However, few efforts have dealt with
   large scale problems very common in massive scenarios (big cities or
   highly-populated regions). In this study, a new distributed algorithm
   based on the partition of the requests space and the combination of the
   routes is presented and tested on a set of 24 different scenarios of a
   large-scale problem (up to 16,000 requests or 32,000 locations) in the
   city of San Francisco. The results show that, not only the distributed
   algorithm is able to solve large problem instances that the
   corresponding sequential algorithm is unable to solve in a reasonable
   time, but also to have an average improvement of 9\% in the smaller
   problems. The results have been validated by means of statistical
   procedures proving that the distributed algorithm can be an effective
   way to solve high dimensional dial-a-ride problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{So-called smart technologies are at the forefront of modern energy
   research. Many existing works focus on the effects of smart
   technologies, with scales ranging from a single household to an entire
   city. One area that is less studied is the adoption of these
   technologies. In this paper, we extend our prior work to develop a more
   robust framework for exploring the diffusion of basic smart grid
   technologies using a social-network-based model to study demand response
   adoption. This network is based around considering an end-user as a
   node, and any relationship where mutual trust and communication exists
   as an edge. In addition, we have incorporated mathematical
   representations of user personality traits in the decision-making
   progress to better simulate real-world actions. We observe greater usage
   of demand response when conventional electricity is high, when
   conscientiousness is high, and when the network is densely connected;
   all of these are reasonable results given logical behavior of the
   individual agents. Our model includes many tunable parameters in the
   update stages, of which the effects of only a few are included in this
   paper. This quantity of potential parameters, as well as the broad
   nature of the model and algorithm, makes our model a candidate for
   future improvement and development based on including different
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for the real-time management of electric
   vehicles (EVs) charging processes. The proposed method aims to limit the
   peak load and to increase the number of rechargeable EVs with respect to
   the scenario in which no coordination action is performed, while
   achieving given constraints on the power distribution system. The
   approach is based on a tight interaction between a scheduling algorithm
   and a power-flow evaluation procedure. The scheduling algorithm finds
   the best charging periods for each EV. The power flow procedure checks
   the achievement of electrical constraints and evaluates the operational
   parameters of the grid. Simulations are carried out on a real
   electricity distribution system of a medium-sized Italian city. The
   results show that the proposed approach increases the number of
   rechargeable EVs up to 33\%. At the same time, the peak load is reduced
   by 25\%. The scheduling algorithm requires an average of 50 ms to
   evaluate each charge request on an ordinary computer, therefore allowing
   its use in real-time conditions.}},

   of walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods, transit-oriented development, and

   psychologists' theory of moral intuitionism helps account for these
   differences. In this view, liberals and conservatives emphasize
   different sets of affective, emotion-laden moral impulsessuch as those
   involving fairness, purity, or ingroup loyaltypredisposing them toward
   particular reactions to compact development. Political ideologies also
   are associated with different personality traits that are relevant to
   opinions on the built environment. To explore the intuitionist
   hypothesis, I review qualitative accounts that suggest an association
   between certain moral worldviews and attitudes toward development
   patterns. I then conduct multivariate analysis of a public opinion

Abstract = {{The collection and treatment of waste poses a major challenge to modern
   urban planning, particularly to smart cities. To cope with this problem,
   a cost-effective alternative to conventional methods is the use of
   Automated Vacuum Waste Collection (AVWC) systems, using air suction on a
   closed network of underground pipes to transport waste from the drop off
   points scattered throughout the city to a central collection point. This
   paper describes and empirically evaluates a novel approach to defining
   daily operation plans for AVWC systems to improve quality of service,
   and reduce energy consumption, which represents about 60\% of the total
   operation cost. We model a daily AVWC operation as a Markov decision
   process, and use Approximate Dynamic Programming techniques (ADP) to
   obtain optimal operation plans. The experiments, comparing our approach
   with the current approach implemented in some real-world AVWC systems,
   show that ADP techniques significantly improve the quality of AVWC
   operation plans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{After the construction of waterworks automated meter reading (AMR)

   both the feasibility of field application of waterworks AMR and the

   one-to-one communication with RF UHF and Internet (i.e. TCP/IP) was
   found to be more stable in AMR systems than multiple-to-one
   communication with RF UHF, DCU, and Wibro. Household water consumption
   clearly showed seasonal periodicity due to weather factors. Based on the
   analysis of liters per capita day (LPCD) for 80 households, the LPCD
   values were found to decrease gradually as the number of residents
   increased due to the saving effects through common consumption (i.e.
   washing, cooking, cleaning, irrigation, etc.). Relative to LPCD values
   of 100 control households without AMR systems, the LPCD values of 80
   pilot households with AMR systems were reduced by 5.3\%. Consequently,
   the deployment of developed waterworks AMR systems integrating smart
   water metering and end-use water consumptions should be encouraged to
   conserve both water and energy for smarter cities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the development and technical infrastructure of an
   energy-efficient research-demonstrative office building created by the
   Center for Energy Technology {[}in polish: Centrum Technologii
   Energetycznych (CTE)] in Swidnica. This modern structure offers multiple
   solutions for relevant research topics, such as energy generation,
   distribution, and preservation. The key contribution of the CTE team was
   to craft a fusion algorithm that could identify the optimal temporal
   system conditions, translate them into control system settings, and,
   through feedback, monitor the energy management processes for the site.
   Although exemplary results have been observed for the single year
   depicted in this paper, several years of future installation monitoring
   are planned. The conclusions obtained from this paper will be formulated
   as recommendations for researchers, designers, installers, and users of
   energy-efficient office buildings. The prospective initiatives of the
   CTE team have also been outlined. The implementation of ISO/IEC/IEEE
   21451-x standards has been proposed as an effective tool for scaling

Abstract = {{This article combines quantitative and qualitative methods to take a
   first look at the app economy and mobile services landscape in the City
   and Region of Brussels, capital of Belgium and Europe. By scraping the
   iTunes App Store and Google Play market places we get a view on platform
   distribution, pricing, public vs. commercial, adoption, appreciation and
   popular categories of Brussels apps aimed at citizens, as well as a view
   on the app economy in the city. This data is then complemented by
   qualitative expert interviews with actors in the field, such as cities,
   interest groups and developers. In the context of the current debate
   surrounding what constitutes a Smart City and the importance of
   smartphones and mobile in this area, we perform a reality check, using
   Brussels as a case. We find that the laggard position Brussels is
   currently in could be an opportunity to leapfrog in the field of mobile
   services, but that a focused vision and clear mobile strategy, while
   thinking of the city as a local innovation platform built on open data,
   is quintessential to achieving this. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In recent decades, compact urban development and smart cities are
   recognised as most sustainable urban form in an effort to protect
   natural environment. Therefore, evaluation of existing compactness and
   sustainability of an area is an essential task before the real
   development takes place. In the literature, it is possible to see some
   studies on city's compactness assessment and most of them have
   considered only a few aspects of compact development analysis. This
   paper aims to analyse urban sustainability of Kajang city (Malaysia)
   through a comprehensive city compactness assessment using geographical
   information system and radar remote sensing technology. To measure
   building density, a RADAR image of the study area was used to extract
   built-up areas with the aid of pixel-based and object-based
   classification schemes. Mixed land use development, urban density and
   intensity were the main indicators of the analysis. Finally,
   multicriteria decision-making and Bayes theorems were applied for
   overall compactness assessment. Building density analysis was validated
   using standard confusion matrix, which showed more than 90\% accuracy.
   Similarly, the root-mean squared error showed 0.35 for object-based
   classification. The results classified the zones of the Kajang city in
   the range of least to most compact zones with the compactness value of
   0.00273-0.0146, respectively. The results obtained in this study can
   help local government to improve the compactness of least compact zones
   to make Kajang city more sustainable. Furthermore, the results revealed
   that efficient public transportation and proper community facilities are
   the key factors to achieve sustainable urban development.}},

   planning approach, matching different types of smartness (technologies,
   tools, and applications) with different types of urban functions and

Abstract = {{Smart cities aim to increase their efficiency and quality-of-life thanks
   to technology-based services and collective intelligence. In this
   environment smartcards represent a strategic instrument to link citizens
   to public administration and local infrastructure to further advance on
   smart city plans. This research proposes a theoretical model and present
   privacy and security as key drivers of citizens' intentions to continue
   using smartcards. The functional benefits (i.e. usefulness and
   ease-of-use), the level of personal interaction with local services, and
   the direct and moderating effects of socio-demographic variables
   complete our framework. The findings of an empirical study with
   smartcard users in Zaragoza (Spain) show usefulness and security as the
   main antecedents of continuance intentions. In turn, the influence of
   socio-demographic variables is not significant, which suggests that
   smartcards should focus on a wide-range of users. These results offer
   interesting implications and recommendations for public managers such as
   the need to guarantee the security of the transaction system and to
   expand the number of services and initiatives relaying on the smartcard
   service in order to gradually develop the smart city transformation. (C)

Abstract = {{Preventive conservation represents a working method and combination of

   Therefore, long-term monitoring of physical parameters influencing

   monitoring of cultural heritage is of interest in order to perform
   future comparative studies and load information into the cloud that will
   be useful for the conservation of other heritage sites. In this paper
   the development of an economical and appropriate acquisition data system
   combining wired and wireless communication, as well as third party
   hardware for increased versatility, is presented. The device allows
   monitoring a complex network of points with high sampling frequency,
   with wired sensors in a 1-wire bus and a wireless centralized system
   recording data for monitoring of physical parameters, as well as the
   future possibility of attaching an alarm system or sending data over the

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things is a new paradigm in which objects in a specific
   context can be integrated into traditional communication networks to
   actively participate in solving a determined problem. The
   Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
   technologies are specific cases of IoT and key enablers for Intelligent
   Transportation Systems (ITS). V2V and V2I have been widely used to solve
   different problems associated with transportation in cities, in which
   the most important is traffic congestion. A high percentage of
   congestion is usually presented by the inappropriate use of resources in
   vehicular infrastructure. In addition, the integration of traffic
   congestion in decision making for vehicular traffic is a challenge due
   to its high dynamic behavior. In this paper, an optimization model over
   the load balancing in the congestion percentage of the streets is
   formulated. Later, we explore a fully congestion-oriented route
   discovery mechanism and we make a proposal on the communication
   infrastructure that should support it based on V2I and V2V
   communication. The mechanism is also compared with a modified Dijkstra's
   approach that reacts at congestion states. Finally, we compare the
   results of the efficiency of the vehicle's trip with the efficiency in
   the use of the capacity of the vehicular network.}},

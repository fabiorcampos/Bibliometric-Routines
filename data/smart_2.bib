Abstract = {{The increasing development of the automotive industry towards a fully
   autonomous car has motivated the design of new value-added services in
   Vehicular Sensor Networks (VSNs). Within the context of VSNs, the
   autonomous car, with an increasing number of on-board sensors, is a
   mobile node that exchanges sensed and state information within the VSN.
   Among all the value added services for VSNs, the design of new
   intelligent parking management architectures where the autonomous car
   will coexist with traditional cars is mandatory in order to profit from
   all the opportunities associated with the increasing intelligence of the
   new generation of cars. In this work, we design a new smart parking
   system on top of a VSN that takes into account the heterogeneity of cars
   and provides guidance to the best parking place for the autonomous car
   based on a collaborative approach that searches for the common good of
   all of them measured by the accessibility rate, which is the ratio of
   the free parking places accessible for an autonomous car. Then, we
   simulate a real parking lot and the results show that the performance of
   our system is close to the optimum considering different communication
   ranges and penetration rates for the autonomous car.}},

Title = {{Attack Classification Schema for Smart City WSNs}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Urban areas around the world are populating their streets with wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs) in order to feed incipient smart city IT systems
   with metropolitan data. In the future smart cities, WSN technology will
   have a massive presence in the streets, and the operation of municipal
   services will be based to a great extent on data gathered with this
   technology. However, from an information security point of view, WSNs
   can have failures and can be the target of many different types of
   attacks. Therefore, this raises concerns about the reliability of this
   technology in a smart city context. Traditionally, security measures in
   WSNs have been proposed to protect specific protocols in an environment
   with total control of a single network. This approach is not valid for
   smart cities, as multiple external providers deploy a plethora of WSNs
   with different security requirements. Hence, a new security perspective
   needs to be adopted to protect WSNs in smart cities. Considering
   security issues related to the deployment of WSNs as a main data source
   in smart cities, in this article, we propose an intrusion detection
   framework and an attack classification schema to assist smart city
   administrators to delimit the most plausible attacks and to point out
   the components and providers affected by incidents. We demonstrate the
   use of the classification schema providing a proof of concept based on a
   simulated selective forwarding attack affecting a parking and a sound
   WSN.}},

Abstract = {{The advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is an architecture for
   two-way communication between electric, gas and water meters and city
   utilities. The AMI network is a wireless sensor network that provides
   communication for metering devices in the neighborhood area of the smart
   grid. Recently, the applicability of a routing protocol for low-power
   and lossy networks (RPL) has been considered in AMI networks. Some
   studies in the literature have pointed out problems with RPL, including
   sub-optimal path selection and instability. In this paper, we defend the
   viewpoint that careful planning of the transmission power in wireless
   RPL networks can significantly reduce the pointed problems. This paper
   presents a method for planning the transmission power in order to assure
   that, after convergence, the size of the parent set of the RPL nodes is
   as close as possible to a predefined size. Another important feature is
   that all nodes in the parent set offer connectivity through links of
   similar quality.}},

   Based on Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Using mobile vehicles as ``data mules{''} to collect data generated by a
   huge number of sensing devices that are widely spread across smart city
   is considered to be an economical and effective way of obtaining data
   about smart cities. However, currently most research focuses on the
   feasibility of the proposed methods instead of their final performance.
   In this paper, a latency and coverage optimized data collection (LCODC)
   scheme is proposed to collect data on smart cities through opportunistic
   routing. Compared with other schemes, the efficiency of data collection
   is improved since the data flow in LCODC scheme consists of not only
   vehicle to device transmission (V2D), but also vehicle to vehicle
   transmission (V2V). Besides, through data mining on patterns hidden in
   the smart city, waste and redundancy in the utilization of public
   resources are mitigated, leading to the easy implementation of our
   scheme. In detail, no extra supporting device is needed in the LCODC
   scheme to facilitate data transmission. A large-scale and real-world
   dataset on Beijing is used to evaluate the LCODC scheme. Results
   indicate that with very limited costs, the LCODC scheme enables the
   average latency to decrease from several hours to around 12 min with
   respect to schemes where V2V transmission is disabled while the coverage
   rate is able to reach over 30\%.}},

   Sensor Networks Based on Apache Storm}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The efficient data access of streaming vehicle data is the foundation of
   analyzing, using and mining vehicle data in smart cities, which is an
   approach to understand traffic environments. However, the number of
   vehicles in urban cities has grown rapidly, reaching hundreds of
   thousands in number. Accessing the mass streaming data of vehicles is
   hard and takes a long time due to limited computation capability and
   backward modes. We propose an efficient streaming spatio-temporal data
   access based on Apache Storm (ESDAS) to achieve real-time streaming data
   access and data cleaning. As a popular streaming data processing tool,
   Apache Storm can be applied to streaming mass data access and real time
   data cleaning. By designing the Spout/bolt workflow of topology in ESDAS
   and by developing the speeding bolt and other bolts, Apache Storm can
   achieve the prospective aim. In our experiments, Taiyuan BeiDou bus
   location data is selected as the mass spatio-temporal data source. In
   the experiments, the data access results with different bolts are shown
   in map form, and the filtered buses' aggregation forms are different. In
   terms of performance evaluation, the consumption time in ESDAS for ten
   thousand records per second for a speeding bolt is approximately 300
   milliseconds, and that for MongoDB is approximately 1300 milliseconds.
   The efficiency of ESDAS is approximately three times higher than that of
   MongoDB.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a scalable route map for the least cost deployment
   of wireless heterogeneous networks that support traffic from the advance
   metering infrastructure (AMI). We first explore the performance of a
   common scenario in which a single technology is employed to connect
   smart meters sending traffic to the utility. Based on simulations with
   actual city maps, we study the coverage provided to smart meters by an
   LTE cellular network. In order to improve the coverage, an optimization
   model that considers network capacity and range is proposed to determine
   the optimal location of base stations to achieve a target coverage of
   smart meters. According to these preliminary results with a single
   access technology, we propose an evolved network architecture that
   considers several alternatives of wireless heterogeneous networks to
   guarantee the coverage to smart meters with the least use of resources.
   We introduce a heuristic model that involves elements from base
   stations, universal data aggregation points, number of smart meters, and
   an optimal routing to achieve the desired connectivity from the group of
   smart meters. We employ geo-referenced models to consider actual
   characteristics of cities as well as geographical conditions. Results
   from the evolved model demonstrate that by combining technologies and
   employing data aggregation points with optimized localizations, the
   network is able to achieve a target coverage of smart meters with a
   reduced cost in terms of technological resources.}},

Abstract = {{The Habitat III Conference's New Urban Agenda hails a paradigm shift for
   pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the new call
   for safe, resilient, sustainable and inclusive cities remains path
   dependent on old methodological tools (e.g. indicators),
   techno-managerial solutions (e.g. smart cities), and institutional
   frameworks of an ecological modernization paradigm that did not work.
   Pursuing a new urban paradigm within this old framework can only act as
   immunology: it vaccinates citizens and environments so that they can
   take larger doses of inequality and degradation in the future; it
   mediates the effects of global socio-environmental inequality, but does
   little towards alleviating it. Indeed, an increasing number of
   communities across the world now decline these immunological offers.
   Instead, they rupture path dependency and establish effective
   alternative methods for accessing housing, healthcare, sanitation, etc.
   I argue that real smart solutions and real social innovation are to be

   practices that act as living indicators of what/where urgently needs to

Abstract = {{Investments through the 2014-2020 European structural funds pursue goals
   of smart, inclusive and sustainable growth, while many towns and cities
   in Europe are shrinking rather than growing. Policy makers and
   practitioners therefore face challenges in ensuring that places with
   very limited growth potential will not fall further behind. While
   scholars argue that cities in long-term decline would benefit from
   enhancing their capacity to develop collaborative initiatives that draw
   on local resources and assets, in practice local decision makers seem to
   struggle to engage their communities in the fight against the causes and
   consequences of decline. This paper advances the argument that the
   concept of co-production is well suited to explore and explain how
   collaborative actions unlock new strategic choices that are based on
   capabilities and resources over which local actors have control. A case
   study from a small manufacturing town in Germany is used to illustrate
   how co-production at different levels can lead to tangible, long-term
   improvements in a context of ongoing shrinkage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making strategy for the

   supports the city energy manager and local policy makers in taking
   energy retrofit decisions on different urban sectors by an integrated,

   decision strategy, a bilevel programming model integrates several local
   decisionmaking units, each focusing on the energy retrofit optimization
   of a specific urban subsystem, and a central decision unit. We solve the
   hierarchical decision problem by a game theoretic distributed algorithm.

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become essential parts in various
   smart city projects. However, the application-specific WSN deployment is
   constrained by its high cost, low flexibility and hard management. To
   address these limitations, a complementary promising solution, known as
   mobile crowdsensing, is proposed. Mobile crowdsensing leverages the
   surge of mobile devices as well as the sensors attached to them to
   opportunistically and cooperatively conduct sensing tasks. Thanks to the
   crowdness and mobility of mobile devices, mobile crowdsensing is able to
   enlarge the sensing scale and granularity. Existing mobile crowdsensing
   techniques are usually centralized methods and rely on infrastructure
   communications. Witnessing the development of Device-to-Device (D2D)
   communications, it is ideal to explore such abilities such that the
   sensing tasks can be conducted in a distributed manner as well as an
   infrastructureless way. Via D2D, all participated nodes can directly
   assign tasks to encountered nodes. In this paper, aided by the encounter
   relationship among mobile nodes, we study the time minimization task
   assignment problem in mobile crowdsensing. Specially, we propose offline
   and online algorithms based on historic encounter information and
   real-time assigned task execution time, respectively. Real-world trace
   based experiments validate the efficiency of our proposal.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Realising the ``smart city{''} vision requires applications that can
   efficiently disseminate context among millions of potentially mobile
   nodes. Numerous context dissemination algorithms exist based on
   flooding-, gossip- and overlay-based approaches. However, due to their
   message transmission (flooding, gossip) or control (overlay) overhead,
   they cannot support the amount of mobile nodes envisaged in urban-scale
   scenarios. This paper describes Adaptive Context Tries (ACT), a
   decentralised context dissemination middleware that balances message
   transmission and control overhead to support urban-scale context-aware
   applications. ACT achieves scalability using a dynamically constructed
   virtual overlay, structured as a retrieval tree (trie) on node
   identifiers (IDs), avoiding continuous overlay rebuilds due to mobility
   or nodes changes by removing the need for subscriptions. Through formal
   analysis and extensive large-scale simulations we show that unlike
   existing context dissemination algorithms ACT can handle dynamic context
   requirements in urban-scale scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the evolution of wireless technologies has allowed
   researchers to design communication systems where vehicles are used as
   first entities to participate in the communication networks using the
   infrastructure present in cities. In this paper, the development of a
   new application under the Android operating system as an effort to
   improve road safety is presented. A new concept, such as Smart Cities
   includes intelligent traffic management in which data from the Traffic
   Information Centre infrastructures could be reachable at any point. The
   goal of this proposal is to manage the traffic lights from inside of the
   emergency vehicles (as ambulance, fire truck, etc.) in order to minimize
   the response time in case of an emergency, therefore, reducing the stop
   time in the intersections due to red lights. Presented in this work is
   the development of an application for the management of traffic lights,
   the objective is to provide the control to drivers over the traffic
   light in the emergency route. Finally we discuss the requirements for
   the real development of the application. This project obtained the best

Abstract = {{In future smart-cities, public transportation vehicles are planned to
   serve as data couriers (DCs) in order to exchange massive amounts of
   data chunks. In this research, we study the path planning problem for
   these DCs while optimizing their counts and their total traveled
   distances. As the total collected load on a given DC route cannot exceed
   its storage capacity, it is important to decide on the size of the
   exchanged data-packets (images, videos, etc.) and the sequence of the
   targeted data sources to be visited. We propose a hybrid heuristic
   approach for public data delivery in smart-city settings. In this
   approach, public vehicles are utilized as DCs that read/collect data
   from numerously distributed Access Points (APs) and relay it back to a
   central processing base-station in the city. We also introduce a
   cost-based fitness function for DCs election in the smart-city paradigm.
   Our cost-based function considers resource limitations in terms of DCs
   count, storage capacity, and energy consumption. Extensive simulations
   are performed, and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach in comparison to other heuristic approaches with respect to
   total traveled distances and overall time complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Metro systems play an important role in meeting the demand for urban
   transportation in large cities. The understanding of passenger route
   choice is critical for public transit management. The wide deployment of
   automated fare collection (AFC) systems opens up a new opportunity.
   However, only each trip's tap-in and tap-out time stamp and stations can
   be directly obtained from AFC system records; the train and route chosen
   by a passenger are unknown, information necessary to solve our problem.
   While existing methods work well in some specific situations, they
   hardly work for complicated situations. In this paper, we propose a
   solution that needs no additional equipment or human involvement than
   the AFC systems. We develop a probabilistic model that can estimate
   fromempirical analysis how the passenger flows are dispatched to
   different routes and trains. We validate our approach using a
   large-scale data set collected from the Shenzhen Metro system. The

Abstract = {{In recent years, research on location-based services has received a lot
   of interest, in both industry and academia, due to a wide range of
   potential applications. Among them, one of the active topic areas is the
   constraint-based route planning on a point-of-interest (POI) network.
   Most of the previous studies on this topic primarily consider the
   geographic properties of the POIs in planning a route. However, we
   consider that the reason that a user visits a POI is that it provides
   some services that the user needs. In particular, in urban environments,
   a POI may provide various kinds of services. Hence, the user's requests
   should be considered. In this paper, we address a novel problem, which
   is called multirequest route planning, and propose a novel framework to
   efficiently plan a route for serving multiple user-specified requests.
   The framework consists of two major modules: planning module, in which
   four approaches with pruning and caching strategies are proposed for
   planning a preliminary route, and refinementmodule, in which two
   refinement mechanisms are proposed for further enhancing the quality of
   the route. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on route
   planning that considers multiple services provided by a POI and multiple
   requests specified by a user, simultaneously. Finally, we perform an
   extensive experimental evaluation based on three real-world POI data
   sets and deliver excellent performance.}},

Abstract = {{Computer science paradigms such as internet of things and ubiquitous
   computing has led to the increase of data and information available for

   dissemination and driving and traffic flow analysis. Smart devices, are
   an adequate choice to ubiquitously gather and transmit data
   unobtrusively. This fuels the opportunity to handle these data as an
   input for data analysis and fusion processes that discover and aggregate
   new information to notify users and communities of incorrect practices,
   thus aiming to effect behavioural change and intelligent planning. The

Volume = {{191}},

Abstract = {{Two residential Smart Grid pilots, PowerMatching City, Groningen (NL)
   and Pecan Street, Austin Texas (USA) have been compared regarding their
   energy performance and the experiences of users in these pilots. The
   objective of the comparison was to gain new insights that could support
   the successful deployment of future residential Smart Grids.
   Measured data on electricity generation and electricity consumption of
   households in 2013 and 2014 were evaluated. Existing reports with
   results of surveys of users were also analyzed.
   The energy performance revealed that the average domestic electricity
   consumption of households in PowerMatching City was lower compared to
   Pecan Street (2.6 GW h versus 10.1 GW h). At the same time, households
   in Pecan Street generated a higher amount of electricity compared to
   PowerMatching City (6.8 GW h versus 1.14 GW h). Households in Pecan
   Street consumed on average, 8\% less electricity with respect to the USA
   average household domestic electricity consumption of 10.9 GW h; while
   households in PowerMatching City consumed 19\% less electricity compared
   to the Dutch average household domestic electricity consumption of 3.1
   GW h.
   Households in PowerMatching City appeared to have a higher potential to
   contribute to electricity demand and supply balancing, because their
   electricity consumption from the grid was largely reduced with increased
   self-generation.
   User experiences revealed that end-users in both pilots preferred
   technologies that automatically shift their energy use, since this
   requires minimal effort from them.
   We conclude that the pattern of households' electricity generation and
   consumption in Smart Grid pilot projects, and their contribution to peak
   load balancing in the electricity network is largely influenced by
   existing Smart Grid set-ups, local climate and related needs for heating
   and cooling, the average capacity of installed energy generating
   technologies and the prevailing energy behavior. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The smart energy city is an emerging concept in urban development,
   aiming to optimize urban energy systems and improve the quality of life

   aims to define smart energy city development not only in a theoretical
   context, but also in terms of practical solutions. We adopt the 5W + 1H
   (why, what, who, where, when, how) model integrated with literature
   review and expert knowledge elicitation, i.e., focus groups and
   interviews. This results in: (i) clarification of general
   interrelationship between smart energy city, smart city, and sustainable
   city; (ii) a holistic, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive conceptual
   framework of smart energy city, revealing its principles, objectives,
   domains of intervention, stakeholders, and time and spatial scales; and
   (iii) a set of smart energy practical solutions and technologies

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{385-418}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Cities play a prominent role in our economic development as more than 80
   \% of the gross world product (GWP) comes from cities. Only 600 urban
   areas with just 20 \% of the world population generate 60 \% of the GWP.
   Rapid urbanization, climate change, inadequate maintenance of water and
   wastewater infrastructures and poor solid waste management may lead to
   flooding, water scarcity, water pollution, adverse health effects and
   rehabilitation costs that may overwhelm the resilience of cities. These
   megatrends pose urgent challenges in cities as the cost of inaction is
   high. We present an overview about population growth, urbanization,
   water, waste, climate change, water governance and transitions. Against
   this background, we discuss the categorization of cities based on our
   baseline assessments, i.e. our City Blueprint research on 45
   municipalities and regions predominantly in Europe. With this bias
   towards Europe in mind, the challenges can be discussed globally by
   clustering cities into distinct categories of sustainability and by
   providing additional data and information from global regions. We
   distinguish five categories of sustainability: (1) cities lacking basic
   water services, (2) wasteful cities, (3) water-efficient cities, (4)
   resource-efficient and adaptive cities and (5) water-wise cities. Many
   cities in Western Europe belong to categories 3 and 4. Some cities in
   Eastern Europe and the few cities we have assessed in Latin America,
   Asia and Africa can be categorized as cities lacking basic water
   services. Lack of water infrastructures or obsolete infrastructures,
   solid waste management and climate adaptation are priorities. It is
   concluded that cities require a long-term framing of their sectoral
   challenges into a proactive and coherent Urban Agenda to maximize the
   co-benefits of adaptation and to minimize the cost. Furthermore,
   regional platforms of cities are needed to enhance city-to-city learning
   and to improve governance capacities necessary to accelerate effective
   and efficient transitions towards water-wise cities. These learning
   alliances are needed as the time window to solve the global water
   governance crisis is narrow and rapidly closing. The water sector can
   play an important role but needs to reframe and refocus radically.}},

Abstract = {{The modern concepts of sustainable cities and smart grids have caused an
   increase in the installation of solar systems in urban and suburban
   areas, where, due to the presence of many obstacles or design
   constraints, photovoltaic (PV) modules can operate in operating
   conditions that are very different from the optimal ones (e. g.,
   standard test conditions, STC). Shading and reflection are the main
   phenomena that cause uneven distribution of irradiance on PV cells; in
   turn, they create a nonuniform distribution of PV cell temperatures. The
   latter problem can also be caused by different ventilation regimes in
   various parts of the PV array. On the other hand, due to the need to
   exploit different solar technologies (solar thermal and photovoltaic),
   problems related to the availability of a useful surface can arise. In
   this context, there is a technology that produces heat end electrical
   energy at the same time, such a technology is referred to as a solar
   hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T). Here, the uneven distribution of
   temperature is a design input and its effect depends on both path of the
   water flow and the PV cell connections. To study the electrical behavior
   of a PV array under mismatching conditions, a suitable MATLAB/SIMULINK
   model has been developed. The model has been tested both numerically and
   experimentally. Finally, an application of this model in the electrical
   analysis of a PV/T module is reported, and the results are discussed.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a methodology is presented and employed for simulating
   the Internet of Things (IoT). The requirement for scalability, due to
   the possibly huge amount of involved sensors and devices, and the
   heterogeneous scenarios that might occur, impose resorting to
   sophisticated modeling and simulation techniques. In particular,
   multi-level simulation is regarded as a main framework that allows
   simulating large-scale IoT environments while keeping high levels of
   detail, when it is needed. We consider a use case based on the
   deployment of smart services in decentralized territories. A two level
   Simulator is employed, which is based on a coarse agent-based, adaptive
   parallel and distributed simulation approach to model the general life
   of simulated entities. However, when needed a finer grained simulator
   (based on OMNeT++) is triggered on a restricted portion of the simulated
   area, which allows considering all issues concerned with wireless
   communications. Based on this use case, it is confirmed that the ad-hoc
   wireless networking technologies do represent a principle tool to deploy
   smart services over decentralized countrysides. Moreover, the
   performance evaluation confirms the viability of utilizing multi-level
   simulation for simulating large scale IoT environments. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In the smart cities, the travel-time is a typical business calculation
   to monitor and control the traffic congestions. But it still faces
   challenges on real-time stream due to the limitation of latency and
   accuracy. In this paper, we propose a collaborative approach for travel
   time calculation on stream of recognized data of vehicles. Compared with
   other types of sensory data in urban roads, the recognized data of
   vehicles has wider coverage, finer interval and more exact locality. Our
   approach continuously achieves both factual and predictive values, and
   consists of two-step spatio-temporal parallelism on real-time data and
   Bayes prior rules mining on historical data. It can be analyzed
   theoretically for its low latency with high accuracy, and has been
   implemented on Apache Storm correlated with Hadoop MapReduce. Through
   exhaustive experiments on simulated and real data, our approach holds
   millisecond-level latencies steadily on high speed stream with nearly
   linear scalability, and keeps the accuracy above 80\% for prediction.

Abstract = {{Digital service platforms are becoming widespread in all areas of

   platform development that includes two competing platforms, and use the
   model to simulate various development paths by varying different factors
   that affect how resources accumulate to the platforms. Our simulation
   results show that delays in users' decision making can increase the
   likelihood of achieving critical mass. In addition, open interfaces and
   data transferability between platforms can accelerate platform adoption
   and decrease the likelihood of a Winner-take-all situation. The

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{82}},

Abstract = {{Development of Internet of things (IoT) has revitalized the feature
   scale of wearables and smart home/city applications. The landscape of
   these applications encountering big data needs to be replotted on cloud
   instead of solely relying on limited storage and computational resources
   of small devices. However, with the rapid increase in the number of
   Internet-connected devices, the increased demand of real-time,
   low-latency services is proving to be challenging for the traditional
   cloud computing framework. Although, fog computing, by providing elastic
   resources and services to end users at the edge of network, emerges as a
   promising solution, but the upsurge of novel social applications such as
   crowd sensing has fostered the need for scalable cost-efficient
   platforms that can enable distributed data analytics, while optimizing
   the allocation of resources and minimizing the response time. Following
   the existing trends, we are motivated to propose a fog computing based
   scheme, called MIST (i.e. a cloud near the earth's surface with lesser
   density than fog), to support crowd sensing applications in the context
   of IoT. For cost-efficient provisioning limited resources, we also
   jointly investigate data consumer association, task distribution, and
   virtual machine placement towards MIST. We first formulate the problem
   into a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) and then linearise it
   into a mixed integer linear program (MILP). A comprehensive evaluation
   of MIST is performed by consideration of real world parameters of the
   Tehran province, the capital of Iran. Results show that as the number of
   applications demanding real-time service increases, the MIST fog-based
   scheme outperforms traditional cloud computing.}},

Abstract = {{Prosecutors are the most powerful organs of the criminal justice system,
   enjoying discretion in decision-making far beyond that of law
   enforcement officials, defense attorneys, and judges. Perhaps due to
   this exceptional position, contemporary understandings and perceptions
   of criminal prosecutors have tended to be largely positive; evidence of
   such a normative understanding of the prosecutor and its role may be
   found from a variety of sources, from (other) law review articles to pop
   cultural touchstones in television and movies. The prevailing
   ``prosecutorial norm{''} in the public consciousness embodies 1) a
   full-time government employee, 2) who devotes all of their time and
   professional energies to criminal prosecution, and 3) tries to somehow
   do or affect some vague notion of ``justice.{''} Such norms, however,
   are regularly challenged and flouted when the prosecutorial function is
   outsourced. Although the outsourcing of nearly every function of the
   criminal adjudicative process has attracted great attention among
   scholars and policymakers, a greater critical lens must be focused on
   prosecutors.
   The hazards of prosecutorial outsourcing have largely been neglected
   because existing prosecutorial scholarship focuses on the United States
   Attorney or district attorneys' offices in large, metropolitan areas.
   Not all prosecutorial offices are created equal, however. Cities, towns,
   and other small political subdivisions throughout the country frequently
   hire prosecutors on a part-time basis through a competitive bidding
   process, releasing requests for proposals (RFPs) in an effort to procure
   bids. This practice, however, may be observed not only in small or rural
   municipalities, but also in cities located near larger population
   centers. Examples of such municipalities include Ferguson, Missouri, and
   Kyle, Texas. Such local governments often work with budgets that are not
   expansive enough to hire a full-time city attorney or prosecutor. Beyond
   demonstrating the qualifications, the applicant attorneys or firms vying
   for a prosecution contract may have to serve as good prosecutors,
   applications from such applicants must also demonstrate cost
   effectiveness by detailing what budget and compensation is required
   during the term of service specified by the RFP.
   Although engaging in a competitive bidding process may seem like a smart
   way to handle the problem of governmental waste and financial
   inefficiencies, it introduces a host of challenges and negative
   externalities. This Article sheds light on the problems caused by
   introducing an overtly economic calculation (how cheaply and how
   profitably the prosecutorial function may be fulfilled) into the
   criminal adjudicative process. This practice not only flouts American
   Bar Association and National District Attorney Association prosecutorial
   standards, but also undermines the prosecutorial norms described above
   in ways that are likely to destabilize confidence and the social
   cohesion born of such confidence in local criminal justice systems. This
   practice has the risk, however, of expanding beyond the reach of non
   -metropolitan jurisdictions to larger counties, cities, and local
   governments as budgets continue to shrink across the board and
   devolution and privatization continue to be advanced as cure alls to
   economic woes.}},

Abstract = {{High-ability students have special education needs that are often
   overlooked or misunderstood (Blaas in Aust J Guid Couns 24(2):243-255,
   2014) which may result in talent loss (Saha and Sikora in Int J Contemp
   Sociol Discuss J Contemp Ideas Res 48(1):9-34, 2011). Educational
   acceleration can help avoid these circumstances and support high-ability
   students to reach their full potential by providing a better match
   between students' abilities and the pace of their education (Assouline
   et al. in A nation empowered: evidence trumps the excuses holding back
   America's brightest students, The Connie Belin \& Jacqueline N. Blank
   International Center for Gifted Education and Talent Development, Iowa
   City, 2015). Concurrent or dual enrollment is a type of acceleration in
   which students are enrolled in two levels of school simultaneously, for
   example, secondary students might attend college or university. In this
   comparative research, we examined how educators and students categorized
   students' motivations to choose concurrent enrollment through a group
   concept mapping process. Participants structured a set of 85 reasons for
   concurrent enrollment by sorting the data into meaningful groups. We
   applied multi-dimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis to
   the grouped data to create a cluster map of the educators'
   categorizations. Key concepts in the educators' map included (a)
   Planning Ahead, (b) Love Learning, (c) Challenge, (d) Smart kids! and
   (e) Meet Intellectual Peers. Next, we quantitatively and qualitatively
   compared the educators' concept map to a map created by students in an
   earlier study. Using Procrustes analysis, we found overall similarities
   in the placement of individual statements on the two maps. However, our
   analysis of the cluster solutions revealed some differences between
   educators' and students' maps. Of particular interest, the students' map
   had more categories, suggesting that students categorized their
   motivations more finely than educators did. Educational practice

   This paper addresses this gap introducing the Business Model Evaluation
   Tool for Smart Cities. This methodology is a simple, organized, flexible
   and the transparent system that facilitates the work of the evaluators
   of potential business models. It is useful to compare two or more
   business models and take strategic decisions promptly. The method is
   part of a previous process of content analysis and it is based on the
   widely utilized Business Model Canvas. The evaluation method has been
   assessed by 11 experts and, subsequently it has been validated applying
   it to the case studies of Santander's waste management and street
   lighting systems, which take advantage of innovative technologies
   commonly used in smart cities.}},

Abstract = {{Energy is one of the most valuable resources of the modern era and needs
   to be consumed in an optimized manner by an intelligent usage of various
   smart devices, which are major sources of energy consumption nowadays.
   With the popularity of low-voltage DC appliances such as-LEDs,
   computers, and laptops, there arises a need to design new solutions for
   self-sustainable smart energy buildings containing these appliances.
   These smart buildings constitute the next generation smart cities.
   Keeping focus on these points, this article proposes a cloud-assisted DC
   nanogrid for self-sustainable smart buildings in next generation smart
   cities. As there may be a large number of such smart buildings in
   different smart cities in the near future, a huge amount of data with
   respect to demand and generation of electricity is expected to be
   generated from all such buildings. This data would be of heterogeneous
   types as it would be generated from different types of appliances in
   these smart buildings. To handle this situation, we have used a
   cloud-based infrastructure to make intelligent decisions with respect to
   the energy usage of various appliances. This results in an uninterrupted
   DC power supply to all low-voltage DC appliances with minimal dependence
   on the grid. Hence, the extra burden on the main grid in peak hours is
   reduced as buildings in smart cities would be self-sustainable with
   respect to their energy demands.
   In the proposed solution, a collection of smart buildings in a smart
   city is taken for experimental study controlled by different data
   centers managed by different utilities. These data centers are used to
   generate regular alerts on the excessive usage of energy from the end
   users' appliances. All such data centers across different smart cities
   are connected to the cloud-based infrastructure, which is the overall
   manager for making all the decisions about energy automation in smart
   cities. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is evaluated with respect to
   various performance evaluation metrics such as satisfaction ratio, delay
   incurred, overhead generated, and demand-supply gap. With respect to
   these metrics, the performance of the proposed scheme is found to be
   good for implementation in a real-world scenario.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing urbanization level of the world population has driven the
   development of a smart city geographic system, conceived as a fully

   challenges in this context is to provide sustainable solutions able to
   jointly optimize the data transfer, exploiting heterogeneous networks,
   and the data processing, exploiting heterogeneous devices, for managing

   mechanism where communication and computing resources are jointly
   managed, allowing load balancing among the different entities in the
   environment, delegating both communication and computation tasks in

Abstract = {{Indian coal mining industry is in transition phase with the growing
   demand of coal and is likely to escalate further with the need of

   practices towards sustainable development. This paper critically
   examines the cause of the problem in the light of Indian laws and

   acquisition by way of proposing a system of returning back the exact
   reclaimed land to its owners under corporate social responsibility
   activity of the industry. The proposed conceptual model of interlinking

   the position of critical scholars who are engaged in a live smart cities
   project that involves the measurement of air quality by using sensor
   tools. As the project is still ongoing, the final results of the work
   are yet to be seen, but, nonetheless worth documenting. This article is
   composed as an early analysis of the air quality sensing project as a
   framework for the larger smart city story of Christchurch. It provides
   an overview of the experiences and lessons learned about the
   implementation of new technologies in a post disaster environment. We
   examine how the narrative of the smart city is constructed, With focus
   on the terminology used by citizens, academicians, government and

   urban problems alone do not suffice to improve life in the city; rather,
   they can result in misaligned expectations or outcomes for stakeholders

Abstract = {{In 2010, IBM created the Smarter Cites Challenge to address critical
   issues of the 21st century through its digital expertise, in
   collaboration with city governments. Despite questions about the origin
   and intentions of IBM's involvement, 130 cities from all around the
   world took up the challenge in the first five years. There is limited
   case study research available on a number of participating cities which
   has not been able to unpack cities' rationale for working with IBM. This
   paper provides an index of all participating cities in the Smarter
   Cities Challenge, to understand the areas of interest in which urban
   governments have been seeking IBM's consulting service. Findings present
   the state of smart city thinking in urban governments, and raise
   questions about the multidimensional integration, if any, across the
   areas of focus in which digital technologies are shaping contemporary

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{As part of the post-2015 United Nations sustainable development agenda,
   the world has its first urban sustainable development goal (USDG) ``to
   make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and
   sustainable{''}. This paper provides an overview of the USDG and
   explores some of the difficulties around using this goal as a tool for
   improving cities. We argue that challenges emerge around selecting the
   indicators in the first place and also around the practical use of these
   indicators once selected. Three main practical problems of indicator use
   include 1) the poor availability of standardized, open and comparable
   data 2) the lack of strong data collection institutions at the city
   scale to support monitoring for the USDG and 3) ``localization{''} - the
   uptake and context specific application of the goal by diverse actors in
   widely different cities. Adding to the complexity, the USDG conversation
   is taking place at the same time as the proliferation of a bewildering
   array of indicator systems at different scales. Prompted by
   technological change, debates on the ``data revolution{''} and ``smart
   city{''} also have direct bearing on the USDG. We argue that despite
   these many complexities and challenges, the USDG framework has the
   potential to encourage and guide needed reforms in our cities but only
   if anchored in local institutions and initiatives informed by open,
   inclusive and contextually sensitive data collection and monitoring. (C)

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{20 years after the appearance of literature evidence and the launch of
   the first, pioneering cases, the smart city domain remains ambiguous and
   generates an increasing argument with regard to its feasibility and
   potential. Indeed, today the smart city domain is being characterized by
   an emerging market that provides novel solutions for cyber-physical
   integration in the urban space; a competitive standardization arena that
   attempts to clarify the domain and homogenize these solutions; a growing
   network of city alliances, forums and market places that aim to bring
   together scientists, practitioners and city governments in an attempt to
   define a common urban future; and a promising international network of
   scholars that studies and evolves the domain. Nevertheless, a ``common
   understanding{''} of what smart city is or could be missing and
   generates questions regarding whether a ``smart utopia{''} - that is the
   outcome of the ``wedding{''} of vendors and local governments - drives
   the above efforts and leaves out real community problems. The aim of
   this paper is to perform an analysis of 10 representative international
   city cases that claim to be smart The analysis is based on a multi
   -method that combines literature evidence, official websites and
   reports, narrative city walks, and interviews with corresponding
   officials. The outcomes distinguish utopia from reality, introduce a
   pool of evidence that can justify whether a city can claim to be smart
   and depict a brief view of the future smart city. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Mobile capped plans are being increasingly adopted by mobile operators
   due to an exponential data traffic growth. Users then often suffer high

   paper, we introduce a novel content access scheme, Crowd-Cache, which
   enables mobile networking in proximity by exploiting the transient
   co-location of devices, the epidemic nature of content popularity, and
   the capabilities of smart mobile devices. Crowd-Cache provides mobile
   users access to popular content cheaply with low latency while improving
   the overall quality of experience. We model the Crowd Cache system in a
   probabilistic framework using a real-life dataset of video content
   access. The simulation results show that, in a public transportation
   scenario, more than 80\% of the passengers can save at least 40\% on
   their cellular data usage during a typical average city bus commute of
   10 minutes. Finally, we show the practical viability of the system by

Abstract = {{In light of the urgent threats presented by climate change and rapid
   urbanisation, interest in `smart city systems' is mounting. In contrast
   to scholarship that poses `smartness' as something that needs to be
   added to cities, recent developments in spatial morphology research
   pursue a view of the built fabric of cities as an extension of the
   cognitive human apparatus, as well as a material formulation of social,
   cultural and economic relations and processes. The built fabric of
   cities needs to be understood as a highly intelligent artefact in
   itself, rather than simple, dead matter. The current focus on high-tech
   systems risks concealing the fact that the machine is already there. In
   contrast to the technological `implements' of smart city systems, this
   article looks at cities as `facilities' - that is, as technologies that
   slow down, store and maintain energy as a resource for a variety of
   purposes. The article builds on space syntax research in order to give
   precision to the understanding of the affordances the cities offer their
   various processes and the ways in which cities operate as information
   storage and retrieval devices for individuals and for society. The city
   must be considered, we argue, in terms of a range of tangled,
   interdependent systems, reaching from individual buildings to the whole
   city, an understanding anchored in notions of `diversity' and `density'
   (recently gathered under the concept of ` spatial capital') and in
   research addressing how the distribution of space and artefacts serve as
   means of knowledge communication (specifically, in complex buildings
   such as libraries and department stores). In conclusion, we argue that
   existing discussions on ` smart city systems' would benefit
   acknowledgement of the role of cities as facilities.}},

Abstract = {{Smart city applications generate large amounts of operational data
   during their execution, such as information from infrastructure
   monitoring, performance and health events from used toolsets, and
   application execution logs. These data streams contain vital information
   about the execution environment that can be used to fine-tune or
   optimize different layers of a smart city application infrastructure.
   Current approaches do not sufficiently address the efficient collection,
   processing, and storage of this information in the smart city domain. In
   this paper, we present Ahab, a generic, scalable, and fault-tolerant
   data processing framework based on the cloud that allows operators to
   perform online and offline analyses on gathered data to better
   understand and optimize the behavior of the available smart city
   infrastructure. Ahab is designed for easy integration of new data
   sources, provides an extensible API to perform custom analysis tasks,
   and a domain-specific language to define adaptation rules based on
   analysis results. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
   approach using an example application for autonomous intersection
   management in smart city environments. Our framework is able to
   autonomously optimize application deployment topologies by distributing
   processing load over available infrastructure resources when necessary

Abstract = {{The development of the IT convergence technology has been serving as the
   basis for the application of the IoT devices to the products being used
   in our everyday life, such as clock, health band, scale, TV, light and
   doorlock. The government and companies have been developing the
   IoT-based smart home, smart city and smart health to enhance the
   national health as well as the life convenience. In particular, the
   government has been providing its diverse supports to the smart health
   in order to utilize electronic medical records, personal health record
   and self-diagnosis. The Ministry of Health and Welfare has been
   expanding the self-diagnosis service through conducting an epidemiologic
   survey on mental illness and mental health, the two issues that are
   becoming a major problem in our society. The results of the survey-based
   self-diagnosis may vary depending on the environment surrounding the
   users as well as the mental state of the users. In this paper, we
   propose the depression index service using the knowledge-based
   crowdsourcing within the smart health platform. The proposed method
   provides the index suitable for the context of each user through using
   the knowledge-based crowdsourcing within the smart health platform to
   compare the actual users with the similar users and predict the
   depression level. The prediction of the depression index uses the
   collaborative filtering model based on the comparison of users with
   other users, and uses the crowdsourcing to supplement the sparsity
   problem. CES-D is used as the criterion for determining the depression
   level, and the CES-D data is collected through the crowdsourcing. In the
   preexisting crowdsourcing process, the highly expert/reliable knowledge
   base to which the context information of the users is applied is
   constructed. The context information of the users is additionally
   collected through the self-diagnosis process, and the data are
   determined through the preconditioning process. The actual users data
   and determined data are applied to the Pearson's correlation coefficient
   to analyze the similarity level of between the actual/preexisting users.
   Then the analyzed similarity is used to service the result of the
   self-diagnosis to the actual users. This is a flexible service to which
   the context information of the users is applied, and it contributes to
   the users' decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{With the gradual deployment of smart meters in many cities around the

   Central to the provision of these newer services is the ability to

   Compared with load forecasting at the city level and larger system
   aggregates, load forecasting for individual households is a much harder
   problem as the loads are much more stochastic and volatile. In this
   paper, we study the use of sparse coding for modeling and forecasting
   these individual household electricity loads. The proposed methods are
   tested on a data set of 5000 households in a joint project with electric
   power board of Chattanooga, for the period from September 2011 to August
   2013. We obtain 10\% improvements in the accuracy of forecasting
   next-day total load and next-week total load when we add sparse code
   features in ridge regression in this difficult problem. We also evaluate
   more classical forecasting methods on this forecasting problem,

Abstract = {{Some new application scenarios for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) such
   as urban resilience, smart house/building, smart agriculture and animal
   farming, among others, can be enhanced by adding multimedia sensors able
   to capture and transmit small multimedia samples such as still images or
   audio files. In these applications, Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks
   (WMSNs) usually share two conflicting design goals. On the one hand, the
   goal of maximizing the network lifetime by saving energy, and on the
   other, the ability to successfully deliver packets to the sink. In this
   paper, we investigate the suitability of several WSNs MAC protocols from
   different categories for low data rate WMSNs by analyzing the effect of
   some network parameters, such as the sampling rate and the density of
   multimedia sensors on the energy consumption of nodes. First, we develop
   a general multi-class traffic model that allows us to integrate
   different types of sensors with different sampling rates. Then, we
   model, evaluate and compare the energy consumption of MAC protocols
   numerically. We illustrate how the MAC protocols put some constraints on
   network parameters like the sampling rates, the number of nodes, the
   size of the multimedia sample and the density of multimedia nodes in
   order to make collisions negligible and avoid long queuing delays.
   Numerical results show that in asynchronous MAC protocols, the
   receiver-initiated MAC protocols (RI-MAC and PW-MAC) consume less energy
   than the sender-initiated ones (B-MAC and X-MAC). B-MAC outperforms
   X-MAC when the sampling rates of multimedia nodes is very low and the
   polling periods are short. PW-MAC shows the lowest energy consumption
   between the selected asynchronous MAC protocols and it can be used in
   the considered WMSNs with a wider range of sampling rates. Regarding
   synchronous MAC protocols, results also show that they are only suitable
   for the considered WMSNs when the data rates are very low. In that
   situation, TreeMAC is the one that offers the lowest energy consumption
   in comparison to L-MAC and T-MAC. Finally, we compare the energy
   consumption of MAC protocols in four selected application scenarios
   related to Smart Cities and environment monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Municipal water supply consumes large quantities of electrical energy to

   new research perspectives on how to compute descriptive models out of
   this collection of geo-spatial data. In this paper, we propose a
   methodology for clustering location-based information in order to
   provide first glance summaries of geographic areas. The summaries are a

   areas with homogeneous density of similar points of interest and
   provides clusters with a rich characterization in terms of the

   clusters using both a qualitative and a quantitative evaluation. In the

Journal = {{ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Concentration of knowledge work in cities generates
   innovations entailing economic development. This paper addresses the
   challenge of turning around the present trend of urban sprawl toward the
   concentrated knowledge work in cities. The assumption is that
   dislocation of office and residential housing entailing longer commuting
   mileage is the main cause of urban sprawl.
   Methods: The life cycle costs method is used for comparison of office
   systems. The present offices system is compared to the concentrated mega
   offices system outside cities, as well as the local and home offices
   within cities. The life cycle costs are assessed with statistical data
   on space, materials and energy, and information services. These are the
   main resources of the offices systems given labor and capital.
   Results: Commuting costs about 22\% of the annual average wage and
   causes congestion, fragmentation of districts, health risks and
   pollution. These high costs can be reduced by changes in the office
   systems. The present office system with commuting adds 40\% to the
   average labor costs. The innovative office systems reduce these costs by
   15 to 28\% of the present offices. Sensitivity analyses underpin the
   findings for nearly all urban conditions. The local office systems are
   particularly cost-effective. The local office system can also save
   nearly 78\% energy and reduce 74\% CO2 emission of the present offices
   along with less space use. Congestion, as well as fragmentation of
   communities and nature caused by commuting can be avoided.
   Conclusions: Some project developers invest in the distributed offices.
   Policies encourage such investments if they reallocate funds from
   infrastructure into refurbishing of the available housing and
   internalize the external effects of land use in the costs of real estate
   development. These policies increase smartness of cities, reduce energy
   use, and improve living qualities in cities.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate how the raise of big data and cognitive
   computing systems is going to redesign the labor market, also impacting
   on the learning processes. In this respect, we make reference to higher
   education and we depict a model of a smart university, which relies on
   the concepts that are at the basis of the novel smart-cities'
   development trends. Thus, we regard education as a process so that we
   can find specific issues to solve to overcome existing criticisms, and
   provide some suggestions on how to enhance universities' performances.
   We highlight inputs, outputs, and dependencies in a block diagram, and
   we propose a solution built on a new paradigm called smarter-university,
   in which knowledge grows rapidly, is easy to share, and is regarded as a
   common heritage of both teachers and students. Among the others, a
   paramount consequence is that there is a growing demand for competences
   and skills that recall the so called T-shape model and we observe that
   this is pushing the education system to include a blend of disciplines
   in the curriculums of their courses. In this overview, among the wide
   variety of recent innovations, we focus our attention on cognitive
   computing systems and on the exploitation of big data, that we expect to
   further accelerate the refurbishment process of the key components of
   the knowledge society and universities as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A major challenge facing all law-enforcement organizations is to
   accurately and efficiently analyze the growing volumes of crime data in
   order to extract useful knowledge for decision makers. This is an
   increasingly important task, considering the fast growth of urban
   populations in most countries. In particular, to reconcile urban growth
   with the need for security, a fundamental goal is to optimize the
   allocation of law enforcement resources. Moreover, optimal allocation
   can only be achieved if we can predict the incidence of crime within
   different urban areas. To answer this call, in this paper we propose an
   artificial intelligence system for predicting per capita violent crimes
   in urban areas starting from socio-economic data, law-enforcement data
   and other crime-related data obtained from different sources. The
   proposed framework blends a recently developed version of genetic
   programming that uses the concept of semantics during the search process
   with a local search method. To analyze the appropriateness of the
   proposed computational method for crime prediction, different urban
   areas of the United States have been considered. Experimental results
   confirm the suitability of the proposed method for addressing the
   problem at hand. In particular, the proposed method produces a lower
   error with respect to the existing state-of-the art techniques and it is
   particularly suitable for analyzing large amounts of data. This is an
   extremely important feature in a world that is currently moving towards
   the development of smart cities.}},

Title = {{mDARAL: A Multi-Radio Version for the DARAL Routing Algorithm}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Smart Cities are called to change the daily life of human beings. This
   concept permits improving the efficiency of our cities in several areas
   such as the use of water, energy consumption, waste treatment, and
   mobility both for people as well as vehicles throughout the city. This
   represents an interconnected scenario in which thousands of embedded
   devices need to work in a collaborative way both for sensing and
   modifying the environment properly. Under this scenario, the majority of
   devices will use wireless protocols for communicating among them,
   representing a challenge for optimizing the use of the electromagnetic
   spectrum. When the density of deployed nodes increases, the competition
   for using the physical medium becomes harder and, in consequence,
   traffic collisions will be higher, affecting data-rates in the
   communication process. This work presents mDARAL, a multi-radio routing
   algorithm based on the Dynamic and Adaptive Radio Algorithm (DARAL),
   which has the capability of isolating groups of nodes into sub-networks.
   The nodes of each sub-network will communicate among them using a
   dedicated radio frequency, thus isolating the use of the radio channel
   to a reduced number of nodes. Each sub-network will have a master node
   with two physical radios, one for communicating with its neighbours and
   the other for being the contact point among its group and other
   sub-networks. The communication among sub-networks is done through
   master nodes in a dedicated radio frequency. The algorithm works to
   maximize the overall performance of the network through the distribution
   of the traffic messages into unoccupied frequencies. The obtained
   results show that mDARAL achieves great improvement in terms of the
   number of control messages necessary to connect a node to the network,
   convergence time and energy consumption during the connection phase
   compared to DARAL.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Research on the impact of natural disasters on the mental
   health of older adults finds both vulnerabilities and resilience. We
   report on the rates of clinically significant depression among older
   adults (aged 60 years) living in areas affected by Hurricane Sandy in
   2012 and the factors associated with mental health need.
   Methods The Sandy Mobilization, Assessment, Referral and Treatment for
   Mental Health (SMART-MH) program integrates community outreach and needs
   assessments to identify older adults with mental health and aging
   service needs. Older adults with significant anxiety or depressive
   symptoms were offered short-term psychotherapy. Social service referrals
   were made directly to community agencies. All SMART-MH activities were
   offered in Spanish, Russian, Mandarin/Cantonese, and English.
   Results Across the full sample, 14\% of participants screened positive
   for depression. Hurricane Sandy stressors predicted increased odds of
   depression, including storm injury, post-storm crime, and the total
   count of stressors. Outcomes varied significantly by age group, such
   that all Sandy-related variables remained significant for younger-old
   adults (aged 60-74 years), whereas only the loss of access to medical
   care was significant for older-old adults (aged 75 years).
   Conclusions Storm-affected communities show higher rates of depressive
   symptoms than seen in the general population, with storm stressors
   affecting mental health needs differentially by age group.}},

Title = {{Metropolitan vision making - using backcasting as a strategic learning
   process to shape metropolitan futures}},
Journal = {{FUTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{73-83}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The need for new forward-looking tools in urban planning is immense: new
   functional relations and structures are now stretching beyond our
   capacity to `rationally' capture modern metropolitan spaces (Neumann \&
   Hull, 2009). At the same time, cities struggle to find tools to help
   manage their long-term transition towards a low-carbon, resource-smart
   economy.
   In 2006-2007, the municipalities in the Helsinki metropolitan region
   organised an international competition for ideas titled ``Greater
   Helsinki Vision 2050.{''} It drew a good number of entries in the
   competition stage and later helped bring together the awarded
   participants with local planning professionals and citizens.
   This paper explores the process behind the vision-making exercise and
   evaluates its success in providing new tools for the long-term
   transition to a low-carbon, resource-smart Helsinki metropolitan region.
   The theoretical framework used in this paper is `incrementalism with
   perspective' (Ganser, Siebel \& Sieverts, 1993) and its ideas on using
   long-term visions in the integration and coordination of incremental
   activities in various institutions. We perceive the backcasting scenario
   method (Dreborg, 1996) as a tool for implementing this approach and
   hence interpret the case example's results through the framework of this
   method.
   The Greater Helsinki Vision 2050 competition was an example of a
   vision-oriented planning process that provided new tools for bringing
   the `unmanageable' metropolitan region within the scope of the
   manageable. The backcasting approach was deployed as a tool'for
   emancipating stakeholders to imagine alternative futures for
   metropolitan spaces.
   The backcasting scenario method should be considered a viable tool when
   managing vision-oriented planning processes: longer than usual time
   horizons help initiate strategic learning among stakeholders. However,
   in addition to civil servants, citizens and other stakeholders should be
   widely engaged in order to secure sustainable results. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Due to the incomprehensive and inconsistent description of spatial and
   temporal information for city data observed by sensors in various
   fields, it is a great challenge to share the massive, multi-source and
   heterogeneous interdisciplinary instant point observation data
   resources. In this paper, a spatio-temporal enhanced metadata model for
   point observation data sharing was proposed. The proposed Data
   Meta-Model (DMM) focused on the spatio-temporal characteristics and
   formulated a ten-tuple information description structure to provide a
   unified and spatio-temporal enhanced description of the point
   observation data. To verify the feasibility of the point observation
   data sharing based on DMM, a prototype system was established, and the
   performance improvement of Sensor Observation Service (SOS) for the
   instant access and insertion of point observation data was realized
   through the proposed MongoSOS, which is a Not Only SQL (NoSQL) SOS based
   on the MongoDB database and has the capability of distributed storage.
   For example, the response time of the access and insertion for
   navigation and positioning data can be realized at the millisecond
   level. Case studies were conducted, including the gas concentrations
   monitoring for the gas leak emergency response and the smart city public
   vehicle monitoring based on BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS)
   used for recording the dynamic observation information. The results
   demonstrated the versatility and extensibility of the DMM, and the

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines demographic, economic, and sociotechnical trends to
   the year 2050 that will shape future demand for buildings. It uses
   historical data and projections from the United Nations and other
   authoritative sources. The paper finds that it is likely that there will
   be more people, hence more or larger buildings in some regions. People
   are living and working longer, older people are becoming a macroeconomic
   burden, and proportionally fewer children are entering the demographic
   pipeline, all of which will contribute to smaller household sizes and
   allow more floor area per person, while also placing a premium on
   user-friendly and accessible buildings. International and rural-tourban
   migration will continue to cause episodic shortages of affordable
   housing. Continuing urbanization will place buildings in increasingly
   larger, but not necessarily denser cities. Economic activity and
   inequality are likely to continue growing, thereby supporting much new
   building construction, while potentially failing to deliver adequate
   amounts of affordable housing. The changing energy price mix for
   buildings is likely to favor electricity. The occupational mix is likely
   to continue changing, leading some workers to become more mobile and
   others to enjoy more leisure time, albeit with great disparities across
   countries and occupations. Flexibility is likely to be prized in future
   commercial buildings, and residential buildings will continue to be used
   intensively for both work and leisure pursuits. Smarter buildings will
   need to remain user-friendly for occupants, even as an emerging
   transhumanism augments personal capabilities. Each of these factors will
   influence the amount and qualities of shelter we will require, the
   home/workplace split, the functions required of future buildings, and
   the energy and environmental footprints of buildings.}},

Abstract = {{The smart-grid concept takes the communications from the enclosed and
   protected environment of a substation to the wider city or nationwide
   area. In this environment, cyber security takes a key role in order to
   secure the communications. The challenge is to be able to secure the
   grid without impacting the latency while, at the same time, maintaining
   compatibility with older devices and non secure services. At the lower
   level, added security must not interfere with the redundancy and the
   latency required for the real-time substation automation communications.

Abstract = {{We report a hybridized electromagnetic-triboelectric generator that
   consists of four units of freestanding triboelectric nano generators
   (TENG) and four electromagnetic generators (EMG) that can be used as a
   self-powered sensor for road traffic monitoring. The proposed hybridized
   nano generator converts the periodical mechanical load over the speed
   bumper into electricity. We optimize the geometry of the electromagnetic
   component for the purpose of high power generation. With combination of
   TENG and EMG, it is shown that the proposed device is capable of the
   power and voltage generation even with very small displacements and low
   frequencies. Depending to the triggering frequency, TENG or EMG
   dominates the power generation considering different mechanical loads.
   The hybridized nanogenerator can deliver output volume power density of
   20.96 W/m(3) and 50.81 W/m(3) for TENG and EMG components in frequency
   of 1 Hz, respectively. The proposed nano generator not only has the
   potential to be implemented for sensing applications and traffic
   monitoring due to its high output voltage, but also is capable of power
   harvesting to act as a self-powered monitoring system. With the global
   interest toward developing smart cities, the proposed self-powered
   device can address the traffic monitoring challenges of those cities by
   providing online traffic information.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on dynamic carpooling services in urban areas to
   address the needs of mobility in real-time by proposing a two-fold

   characterize the proposed solution: partial ridesharing, according to
   which the riders can walk to reach the driver along his/her route when
   driving to the destination; the possibility to share the ride when the
   driver has already started the ride by modeling the mobility to reach
   the driver destination. To analyze which features of the population
   bring better performance to changing the characteristics of the users,
   we also conducted emulations. When compared with current solutions,
   CLACSOON allows for achieving a decrease in the waiting time of around
   55\% and an increase in the driver and passenger success rates of around
   4\% and 10\%, respectively. Additionally, the proposed features allowed

Abstract = {{In recent years the use of satellite remote sensing techniques has
   proven to be a useful tool for monitoring urban surface parameters: data
   provided on the reflective and thermal state of the urban texture, both
   at local and global scale, give fundamental information on the surface
   urban heat island (SUHI) control of the urban planning.
   In this work, the retrieval of the urban albedo and land surface
   temperature (LST) from Landsat 7 satellite data is performed over a
   selected area of a town in Central Italy (Terni), exhibiting a
   significant urban change during the last 10 years. Comparing two
   satellite images on 2005 and on 2015, the spatial pattern of albedo and
   LST shows an average albedo decrease of 0.03 during this period and a
   daytime SUHI increase of 2.3 degrees C.
   As highlighted by a focused local scale analysis, built-up area
   modifications moved towards both a reduction and an increase of the
   surface albedo, comparing the previous situation of the area and the
   reflective properties of materials chosen for the new settlements or
   refurbishments.
   The proposed analysis with remote sensing data may be considered an

Abstract = {{Situated within science of science, this study analyzes the nature,
   practice, and impact of ICT of the new wave of computing for urban
   sustainability as a form of science and technology (S\&T) within the
   defining context of smart sustainable cities. Specifically, it probes
   the ways in which this form has emerged from different perspectives, why
   it has become institutionalized and interwoven with politics and
   policyurban dissemination, as well as the risks it poses to
   environmental sustainability in the context thereof. To achieve these
   aims, an analytical and philosophical framework of STS is adopted, which
   supports analyses and evaluations whose approaches are drawn from a
   variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. The study shows
   that smart sustainable cities are discursively construed and materially
   produced by the socially constructed understandings and socially
   anchored and institutionalized practices pertaining to ICT of the new
   wave of computing for urban sustainability. Thereby, such cities are
   medicated by and situated within ecologically and technologically
   advanced societies. And as urban manifestations of scientific knowledge
   and technological innovation, they are shaped by, and also shape,
   sociocultural and politicoinstitutional structures. In addition, the
   study demonstrates that the success and expansion of smart sustainable
   cities stem from the transformational power, knowledge/power relation,
   productive and constitutive force, and legitimation capacity underlying
   ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability due to its
   association with the scientific discourse and its societal entailments.
   This form of S\&T is, however, shown to pose risks to environmental
   sustainability. Therefore, it needs to be reoriented in a more
   environmentally sustainable direction, as it can not, as currently
   practiced, solve the complex environmental problems placed in the agenda
   of smart sustainable cities as a holistic approach to urban development.

Abstract = {{Governance has been a key concept in urban studies since the late 1980s.
   This paper reflects on its use and development over the past 25 years
   and identifies contemporary innovations and concerns that will likely
   define the future of urban governance studies. The paper argues that to
   fully understand the impacts of governance approaches on our
   understanding of cities, urban regions and global urbanism, we must
   address how urbanism, rather than urbanisation, is governed. An
   attention to urbanism highlights a wider range of scholarly work on how
   the mutually constitutive relationships between the development of built
   environments and the identities, practices, struggles and opportunities
   of everyday social life are governed. In introducing 15 contributions
   from the archives of Urban Studies, the paper employs a heuristic
   framing - urban governance studies (UGS) 1.0, 2.0, and beyond - to show
   that, while governance as a contemporary critical concept gained
   prominence through the work of Marxian political economists concerned
   largely with urbanisation (UGS 1.0), other work, analysing the
   governance of other aspects of urbanism, including identity and
   citizenship (UGS 2.0), also has a significant history. The paper then
   points to ways in which urban governance studies grapple with future-
   defining challenges, such as climate change, and new framings, such as
   the ` smart city', while extending the scope of their analyses both
   temporally and spatially. The paper concludes by pointing to gaps and
   potential topics for ongoing attention.}},

   models take into account the time of day effect, the heterogeneous truck

   characteristics, driver and vehicle characteristics, built environment
   factors and traffic volume attributes. Based on the results from the
   co-location quotient analysis, a spatial generalized ordered probit

   dependency among single-vehicle truck crashes. The sample is drawn from
   the state maintained incident data, the publicly available Smart

   severity. It also suggests that heterogeneity does exist in the truck
   weight, and it behaves differently in single-Vehicle and multi-vehicle
   truck crashes. Furthermore, individual truck crashes are proved to be
   spatially dependent events for both single and multi-vehicle crashes.
   Last but not least, significant time of day effects were found for PM

Abstract = {{The penetration of electric vehicles is a key instrument in the
   operation of smart grids. Their active participation in the electrical
   system is proposed as a tool to increase security of supply,
   successfully reducing the large differences that occur between periods
   of higher and lower electricity demand. This research presents an
   analysis of the vehicle-to-grid impact in low capacity electrical
   systems, as in the case of islands, aiming to establish a
   charge/discharge pattern that facilitates the penetration of electric
   vehicles in weak grids. In such a way, a comprehensive scenario needs to
   be assessed in order to obtain significant results to be applied not
   only in islands and outermost regions but also in scaled systems such as
   minigrids. To achieve this objective, a theoretical method for the
   efficient charge/discharge management of electric vehicles is proposed,
   defined by a multi-objective model based on criteria of mobility and
   technical requirements. The proposed model is applied to the island of
   Tenerife, which quantifies the electric vehicle penetration in a real
   case. The results show that grids in islands can assimilate ``low{''} or
   ``transition{''} penetrations of electric vehicles, so their use as
   storage systems allow to significantly reduce the amplitude difference
   between valleys and peaks of the electric energy demand curve and
   thereby to contribute to the efficient management of smart grids. (C)

Abstract = {{Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have become a weapon of
   choice for hackers, cyber extortionists, and cyber terrorists. These
   attacks can swiftly incapacitate a victim, causing huge revenue losses.
   Despite the large number of traditional mitigation solutions that exists
   today, DDoS attacks continue to grow in frequency, volume, and severity.
   This calls for a new network paradigm to address the requirements of
   today's challenging security threats. Software-defined networking (SDN)
   is an emerging network paradigm which has gained significant traction by
   many researchers to address the requirement of today's data centers.
   Inspired by the capabilities of SDN, we present a comprehensive survey
   of existing SDN-based DDoS attack detection and mitigation solutions. We
   classify solutions based on DDoS attack detection techniques and
   identify requirements of an effective solution. Based on our findings,
   we propose a novel framework for detection and mitigation of DDoS
   attacks in a large-scale network which comprises a smart city built on
   SDN infrastructure. Our proposed framework is capable of meeting
   application-specific DDoS attack detection and mitigation requirements.
   The primary contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide an
   in-depth survey and discussion of SDN-based DDoS attack detection and
   mitigation mechanisms, and we classify them with respect to the
   detection techniques. Second, leveraging the characteristics of SDN for
   network security, we propose and present an SDN-based proactive DDoS
   Defense Framework (ProDefense). We show how this framework can be
   utilized to secure applications built for smart cities. Moreover, the
   paper highlights open research challenges, future research directions,
   and recommendations related to SDN-based DDoS detection and mitigation.}},

Abstract = {{Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has gained considerable attention from
   industry and academia due to the development of communication technology
   and smart city. However, a proprietary and closed way of operating
   hardware in network equipment slows down the progress of new service
   deployment and extension in IoV. Moreover, the tightly coupled control
   and data planes in traditional networks significantly increase the
   complexity and cost of network management. By proposing a novel
   architecture, i.e., software-defined IoV (SDIV), we adopt a
   software-defined network (SDN) architecture to address these problems by
   lever-aging its separation of the control plane from the data one and a
   uniform way to configure heterogeneous switches. However, IoV
   characteristics introduce some great challenges in rule installation due
   to the limited size of flow tables at Open Flow-enabled switches that
   are the main SDN component. It is necessary to build compact flow tables
   for IoV scalability. Accordingly, we develop a novel rule installation
   mechanism to reduce the number of rules for real-time query services in
   SDIV. We separate the wired data plane from the wireless one and use
   multicast addresses in the latter. We introduce a destination-driven
   model in the wired data plane to reduce the number of rules at switches.
   Experiments with a real data trace show that the developed approach
   significantly reduces the number of rules without degrading the
   performance of data transmissions for real-time query services in IoV.}},

Abstract = {{Device-Free simultaneous wireless Localization and Activity Recognition
   (DFLAR) is a promising novel technique that empowers wireless networks
   with the ability to perceive the location and activity of a target
   within its deployment area while not equipping the target with a device.
   This technique turns traditional wireless networks into smart
   context-aware networks and will play an important role in many smart
   applications, e.g., smart city, smart space, and smart house.
   Essentially, DFLAR utilizes the shadowing effect incurred by the target
   on wireless links to realize localization and activity recognition. The
   feature utilized to characterize the shadowing effect is crucial for
   DFLAR. Traditional methods use time-domain features to characterize the
   shadowing effect. In this paper, we explore the method of realizing
   DFLAR with a wavelet feature. Compared with the time-domain feature, the
   wavelet feature could characterize link measurement in both the time and
   frequency domains, which could provide in-depth robust discriminative
   information and, therefore, improve the performance of the DFLAR system.
   Meanwhile, we also design a two-stage strategy to realize multitarget
   DFLAR with the feature map built by one target only, which reduces the
   training complexity remarkably. The experimental results in a clutter
   indoor scenario show that it could achieve location estimation and
   activity recognition accuracy of higher than 90\%.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, technology is such an integral part of our lives that the
   dependency on its benefits is growing faster than ever. With the arrival
   of the paradigms of smart cities and the Internet of Things, citizens
   are able to improve their quality of life. Given that sensors and
   actuators deployed in smart cities usually have limited resources,
   today, it is a common practice to use cloud computing to extend the
   scope and benefits of smart cities. Taking into consideration that
   communication between applications and devices is vital for a good
   performance of services in a smart city, it is necessary to design new
   architectures and mechanisms to provide reliability in communications. A
   key aspect that has to be addressed by the new communications approaches
   is the possibility to recover the network and its services in case of
   faults, without human intervention. In this paper, a novel architecture
   to improve the resilience level of the infrastructure in the Internet of

Abstract = {{New services and applications become part of our daily activities as we
   evolve into new solutions supported by cutting-edge paradigms, like the
   Internet of Things and Smart Cities. In order to properly achieve the

   applications such as eHealth and public safety. The communication
   infrastructure must cope with these challenges by offering innovative

Abstract = {{This paper seeks to provide some explanation as to how demand-, supply-
   and institutions related factors in China have affected the creation and
   diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT)related products and services.
   Concerning demand side factors the paper demonstrates how potential
   market size and existing technology trajectory work in favor of IoT
   diffusion. As a related demand side factor the paper argues that, in
   terms of the technological trajectory, China has started farther from
   the frontier than most industrialized countries. The degree of
   incremental benefit from the IoT is thus higher in the country. As to
   the supply side factors, the article promotes an understanding of how
   Chinese technology companies have capitalized on a huge user base to
   develop IoT-based applications. It also suggests that technologies and
   expertise provided by foreign multinationals have also played crucial
   roles. Regarding formal institutions, the government's proactive
   policies have been a major factor in the IoT's evolution. It is also in
   the Chinese government's interest to develop IoT products to make
   censorship and surveillance more effective. Regarding informal
   institutions, Chinese consumers are less concerned than Westerners about
   being tracked and monitored, which provides a favorable condition for
   the adoption of IoT-enabled devices. Nonetheless, this condition is
   changing due to increasing abuse of consumer privacy. China and the U.S.
   are compared in terms of diffusion, key determinants, performance
   indicators and impacts of the IoT in order to understand the areas that
   China outperforms-and underperform-the U.S. Some indicators are proposed
   to gauge the IoT-related performance and the impacts of the IoT.}},

Abstract = {{The urban sound environment of New York City (NYC) can be, amongst other
   things: loud, intrusive, exciting and dynamic. As indicated by the large
   majority of noise complaints registered with the NYC 311 information
   complaints line, the urban sound environment has a profound effect on
   the quality of life of the city's inhabitants. To monitor and ultimately
   understand these sonic environments, a process of long-term acoustic
   measurement and analysis is required. The traditional method of
   environmental acoustic monitoring utilizes short term measurement
   periods using expensive equipment, setup and operated by experienced and
   costly personnel. In this paper a different approach is proposed to this

Abstract = {{With the increase in urbanization in modern cities, major roads and
   highways are built nearer to residential areas. Due to some
   inconsiderate driving behaviors, like accelerating and racing; illegal
   tailpipe modification; and aging vehicles, traffic noise is creating a
   nuisance to residents staying near highway, especially during late night
   or early morning. Unfortunately, these noisy vehicles often cannot be
   caught on the spot, unless traffic police is stationed at a certain
   place with their sound pressure level meter and camera. This latter
   approach is often not sustainable and incurs costly manpower resource.
   An automatic Noisy vehicle surveillance Camera (NoivelCam) system, which
   can be deployed in overhead structure across Major highways near
   residential buildings, is being designed to capture noise level
   generated from passing vehicles and triggers a high-speed camera to
   capture the number plate of offending vehicles that exceed a certain
   noise level. Therefore, the proposed system provides time stamp, number
   plate, sound pressure level, audio, and video evidence of the offending
   vehicle and a means to issue an inspection notice to the owner of the
   vehicle. This paper provides a description of the NoivelCam, and some of
   its features to pinpoint noise generated from passing vehicle. An
   initial in-situ deployment of this system has been carried out in
   Singapore to test out its effectiveness in monitoring vehicle noise
   pressure level in a single lane on a highway. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Implementation of smart and sustainable energy projects in urban areas
   encounters different barriers. These barriers range from common
   financial shortage to specific constraints, which depend on local
   socio-economic, environmental and political characteristics of each
   city. In spite of various experiences of European cities in smart and
   sustainable energy projects, the transfer of lessons learnt on how to
   manage barriers in new projects is inefficient. The main aim of this
   paper is to apply a case-based learning methodology to predict barriers
   to a given smart and sustainable energy project. To achieve this aim, a
   learning methodology is proposed and applied to the case study of the
   city of Bolzano, within SINFONIA project. SINFONIA is a European
   Commission Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) project for integration of
   smart and sustainable energy solutions at urban district level. The
   proposed methodology operates in two main steps: first, identifying and
   selecting the most similar European smart and sustainable energy cases
   to the target-case (Bolzano within SINFONIA); second, investigating
   barriers to implementation of selected cases. The results show that the
   barriers fragmented ownership of properties, limited access to capital
   and cost disincentives, and perception of interventions as complicated
   and expensive, with negative social or environmental impacts are highly
   probable to occur in Bolzano within SINFONIA. The proposed methodology
   is applicable and replicable for urban planners and decision-makers in
   different territorial levels to facilitate and accelerate the
   implementation of smart and sustainable energy projects. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In recent decades, our cities are increasingly expected to become more
   sustainable urban forms, with many added determinants. A multitude of
   city concepts has therefore been contrived. The most time-honored and
   prominent concept is the ``sustainable city,{''} which is depicted as a
   model urban form and thereafter more city concepts have come into being.
   However, it is not clear for all the concepts, for instance,
   ``eco-cities,{''} ``smart city,{''} ``sustainable city,{''} and
   ``resilient city,{''} what are the underpinning building blocks within
   each concept and how these concepts correlate with each other. This
   bibliometric study organizes this in conducting a descriptive summary, a
   clustering analysis, and multidimensional scaling of major city
   concepts, by establishing a co-word matrix of high-frequency keywords
   occurring in the Science Citations Index (SCI) and Social Science
   Citations Index (SSCI) databases. In addition to summarizing the
   evolution of these concepts, it analyzes the composition of each city
   concept and the core issues addressed by each city type. Also
   investigated are the correlations between the city concepts with a
   statistical analysis of the clusters of literature in one concept that
   overlap or connect to other clusters in another. From this, it is shown
   that, under the two umbrella terms of ``sustainable city{''} and ``smart
   city,{''} the ``?-city{''} literature has developed in a variety of
   distinctive ways. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{City assessment tools can be used as support for decision making in
   urban development as they provide assessment methodologies for cities to
   show the progress towards defined targets. In the 21st century, there
   has been a shift from sustainability assessment to smart city goals. We
   analyze 16 sets of city assessment frameworks (eight smart city and
   eight urban sustainability assessment frameworks) comprising 958
   indicators altogether by dividing the indicators under three impact
   categories and 12 sectors. The following main observations derive from
   the analyses: as expected, there is a much stronger focus on modern
   technologies and ``smartness{''} in the smart city frameworks compared
   to urban sustainability frameworks. Another observation is that as urban
   sustainability frameworks contain a large number of indicators measuring
   environmental sustainability, smart city frameworks lack environmental
   indicators while highlighting social and economic aspects. A general
   goal of smart cities is to improve sustainability with help of
   technologies. Thus, we recommend the use of a more accurate term ``smart
   sustainable cities{''} instead of smart cities. However, the current
   large gap between smart city and sustainable city frameworks suggest
   that there is a need for developing smart city frameworks further or
   re-defining the smart city concept. We recommend that the assessment of
   smart city performance should not only use output indicators that
   measure the efficiency of deployment of smart solutions but also impact
   indicators that measure the contribution towards the ultimate goals such
   as environmental, economic or social sustainability. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Motion sensors, especially accelerometers, on smart-phones have been
   discovered to be a powerful side channel for spying on users' privacy.
   In this paper, we reveal a new accelerometer-based side-channel attack
   which is particularly serious: malware on smartphones can easily exploit
   the accelerometers to trace metro riders stealthily. We first address
   the challenge to automatically filter out metro-related data from a mass
   of miscellaneous accelerometer readings, and then propose a basic attack
   which leverages an ensemble interval classifier built from supervised
   learning to infer the riding trajectory of the user. As the supervised
   learning requires the attacker to collect labeled training data for each
   station interval, this attack confronts the scalability problem in big
   cities with a huge metro network. We thus further present an improved
   attack using semi-supervised learning, which only requires the attacker
   to collect labeled data for a very small number of distinctive station
   intervals. We conduct real experiments on a large self-built dataset,
   which contains more than 120 h of data collected from six metro lines of
   three major cities. The results show that the inferring accuracy could
   reach 89\% and 94\% if the user takes the metro for four and six
   stations, respectively. We finally discuss possible countermeasures
   against the proposed attack.}},

Abstract = {{Ride-sharing services are transforming urban mobility by providing
   timely and convenient transportation to anybody, anywhere, and anytime.
   These services present enormous potential for positive societal impacts
   with respect to pollution, energy consumption, congestion, etc. Current
   mathematical models, however, do not fully address the potential of
   ride-sharing. Recently, a large-scale study highlighted some of the
   benefits of car pooling but was limited to static routes with two riders
   per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics). We present a more
   general mathematical model for real-time high-capacity ride-sharing that
   (i) scales to large numbers of passengers and trips and (ii) dynamically
   generates optimal routes with respect to online demand and vehicle
   locations. The algorithm starts from a greedy assignment and improves it
   through a constrained optimization, quickly returning solutions of good
   quality and converging to the optimal assignment over time. We quantify
   experimentally the tradeoff between fleet size, capacity, waiting time,
   travel delay, and operational costs for low-to medium-capacity vehicles,
   such as taxis and van shuttles. The algorithm is validated with similar
   to 3 million rides extracted from the New York City taxicab public
   dataset. Our experimental study considers ride-sharing with rider
   capacity of up to 10 simultaneous passengers per vehicle. The algorithm
   applies to fleets of autonomous vehicles and also incorporates
   rebalancing of idling vehicles to areas of high demand. This framework
   is general and can be used for many real-time multivehicle, multitask
   assignment problems.}},

Volume = {{98}},

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm in computer networks in
   which resource-constrained objects connect to unreliable Internet by
   using a wide range of technologies. The insecure nature of the Internet
   and wireless sensor networks, that are the main components of loT, make
   loT vulnerable to different attacks, especially routing attacks (as
   insider attacks). A novel real-time hybrid intrusion detection framework
   is proposed in this study that consists of anomaly-based and
   specification-based intrusion detection modules for detecting two
   well-known routing attacks in IoT called sinkhole and
   selective-forwarding attacks. For this purpose, the specification-based
   intrusion detection agents, that are located in the router nodes,
   analyze the behavior of their host nodes and send their local results to
   the root node through normal data packets. In addition, an anomaly-based
   intrusion detection agent, that is located in the root node, employs the
   unsupervised optimum-path forest algorithm for projecting clustering
   models by using incoming data packets. This agent, which is based on the
   MapReduce architecture, can work in a distributed platform for
   projecting clustering models and consequently parallel detecting of
   anomalies as a global detection approach. The proposed method makes
   decision about suspicious behavior by using a voting mechanism. Notably,
   the proposed method is also extended to detect wormhole attack. The
   deployment of the hybrid proposed model is investigated in a smart-city
   scenario by an existing platform, as well. The free network's scale and
   the ability to identify malicious nodes are two key features of the
   proposed framework that are evaluated through different experiments in
   this study. The experimental results of simulated scenarios showed that
   the proposed hybrid method can achieve true positive rate of 76.19\% and
   false positive rate of 5.92\% when both sinkhole and
   selective-forwarding attacks were launched simultaneously. These rates
   in detecting wormhole attack are 96.02\% and 2.08\%, respectively. (C)

Abstract = {{The study of vehicular traffic is essential for modern cities to
   determine the efficiency of their current roads and to plan new

   sensor networks offer the possibility to study with high accuracy the
   traffic conditions on every point of the road. Using sensor networks
   parameters like speed, travel direction, and type of vehicles can be
   precisely calculated. Furthermore, it is possible to determine in real
   time the peak hours and the site of accidents. Different sources such as
   sound, magnetism, or vibrations can be used to monitor the traffic flow.
   From them, road vibrations are of special interest because of their
   potential for energy harvesting by using piezoelectric films and thus
   reducing the dependence on external power sources. This paper presents a
   study that provides the bases to develop a 2-D sensor network using MEMS
   accelerometers placed on the width and length of the road surface to
   monitor continuously the traffic flow. In this paper, piezoelectric
   acceleration sensors, based on the same measuring principle as MEMS

Abstract = {{Electric and Hybrid Electric vehicles (EV and HEV) seem to be the future
   of transport in smart cities and the key for the total reduction of
   noise disturbance and pollution in urban areas. However, several
   problems have to be solved to guarantee the safety of these types of
   vehicle. Up to now, the use of HEV has shown the dangers of a
   ``quiet{''} transport system in urban environments; in fact, it has been
   estimated that an HEV is twice as likely to be involved in a pedestrian
   crash as would be an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle in the
   same situation. With the aim of improving their safety, different kinds
   of warning sounds are being designed to increase the detectability of EV
   and HEV without themselves becoming new annoying sound sources. The
   sound directivity, frequency of emission and intensity of warning sound
   systems will guarantee their efficiency and limited noise impact.
   Several research works bring to the fore a significant variation of the
   pedestrian response time to different acoustic stimuli. However, it is
   necessary to examine the suitability of these warning sounds according
   to the urban environments in which they are going to be emitted.
   Distinct areas inside the city have different soundscapes whose spectral
   content can vary significantly, masking some of the sounds suggested as
   an alert.
   This paper analyses in detail the main characteristics of several
   warning sounds proposed by the industry, conducting a comparative study
   of the different design trends. A total of 131 sighted listeners were
   exposed to a virtual road-crossing test. The behaviour and
   appropriateness of warning sounds are analysed depending on the urban
   environment. For this purpose, three clearly different soundscapes have
   been selected: stopped vehicles at a traffic light, a pedestrian
   shopping area and the vicinity of a playground. The results highlight
   the wide variability in pedestrian reaction time for the different
   warning sounds used. Some signals considerably improve the detectability
   of the vehicle, providing results even above the ICE vehicle ones.
   However, other warning sounds do not decrease the reaction time with
   respect to the EV. In addition, a clear dependence is observed between
   the detectability and the soundscape involved, changing the results for
   the same warning sound depending on the acoustic environment. (C) 2016

   semantic model Doc2vec to mine the semantic distribution of subway
   stations based on human mobility patterns and points of interest (POIs),
   which sense the dynamic (people's social activities) and static
   characteristics (POI categories) of each station. We examine the
   correlation between mobility patterns of commuters and travellers and
   the spatio-temporal functions of stations. In addition, we develop the
   POI feature vectors to jointly explore the functions of stations from a
   perspective of static geographic location. Subsequently, we leverage
   affinity propagation algorithm to cluster all the stations into ten
   functional clusters and obtain the latent spatio-temporal functions. We
   conduct extensive experiments based on the massive urban data, including
   subway smart card transaction data and POIs to verify that the proposed
   framework IS2Fun outperforms existing benchmark methods in terms of
   identifying the functions of subway stations.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPS) have the great potential to transform
   people's lives. Smart cities, smart homes, robot assisted living, and
   intelligent transportation systems are examples of popular CPS systems
   and applications. It is an essential but challenging requirement to
   offer secure and trustworthy real-time feedback to CPS users using
   spectrum sharing wireless networks. This requirement can be satisfied
   using collaborative spectrum sensing technology of cognitive radio
   networks. Despite its promising benefits, collaborative spectrum sensing
   introduces new security threats especially internal attacks (i.e.,
   attacks launched by internal nodes) that can degrade the efficiency of
   spectrum sensing. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new
   transferring reputation mechanism and dynamic game model-based secure
   collaborative spectrum sensing strategy (TRDG). More specifically, a
   location-aware transferring reputation mechanism is proposed to resolve
   the reputation loss problem caused by user mobility. Furthermore, a
   dynamic game-based recommendation incentive strategy is built to
   incentivize secondary users to provide honest information. The
   simulation experiments show that the TRDG enhances the accuracy of
   spectrum sensing and defends against the internal attacks effectively
   without relying on a central authority.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Smart cities still need the appropriate tools for allowing researchers
   to contribute in this growing field that will change the comfort and
   qualities of live of citizens. Smart cities can provide services such as
   informing of the less overcrowded tourist routes, pathfinding for
   avoiding traffic jams, search services for parking, collecting tree
   branches from streets, and the finding of the nearest available public
   electric bicycles or cars. The levels of urgencies differ from some
   situations to others. Examples of urgent matters are the fast
   transportation critical patients and the removal of obstacles in main
   roads. Since smart cities are meant to manage huge amounts of requests,
   priorities should be automated and managed in a flexible way for new
   scenarios. Smart cities may need citizens to report the service
   priorities. However, citizens may have different criteria and could
   abuse the highest priority levels hindering the service performance for
   really urgent matters. A novel agent-based simulation open-source
   framework is proposed for testing different policies for normalizing and
   controlling self-reported priorities, with its simulator called
   ABS-SmartPriority. This approach is illustrated by simulating two
   different policies, in which the smart policy outperformed the one used

Journal = {{LOCAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1237-1251}},
Abstract = {{This article explores how strategies to encourage households to consume
   less water, through education and the installation of smart meters, play
   out in actual social worlds where the texture and complexity of
   households, and the individuals within them, have a tendency to be
   simplified to average or statistical norms. Building on research and
   critical analysis from earlier studies, particularly in Australia, this
   research set out to explore Thames Water's smarter home initiative
   deploying three frames affect, habit, and the meaning of home - for
   thinking through the different responses of householders to the
   intervention. The study revealed that differences in response to the
   smarter home visit were articulated across income, education, gender,
   age, and ethnicity - not as homogenous or fixed categories, but rather
   as categories which emerged through the smart metering intervention. The
   research concluded that demand management interventions such as the
   smarter home visits, conceived as a relatively simple technology-driven
   behavioural change strategy, are more complex and nuanced in their
   reception and effects, especially on the user-provider relationship, in
   the constitution of social differences, and in the definitions of public
   and private spaces and practices. Acceptance or resistance of these
   programmes is not knowable in advance of their dissemination. For such
   interventions to be successful, water companies thus need to recognise
   the differentiated social, cultural, and economic environments in which
   their strategies are enacted. A failure to do so can only limit their
   stated objectives of reducing household water consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in various application

   technology. In this paper, we focus on privacy protection for location
   trajectory data, which is collected in intelligent transportation
   system. First, we demonstrate that the moving preference of individuals
   can be exploited to perform re-identification attacks, which may cause
   serious damage to the identity privacy of users. To address this
   re-identification problem, we present a new trajectory anonymity model,
   in which the degree of correlation between parking locations and
   individuals is precisely characterized by a concept of Location
   Frequency-inverse user frequency (LF-IUF, for short). We then propose an
   anonymizing method to replace parking locations by a k-correlation
   region. Our method provides a novel anonymity solution for publishing
   trajectory data, which achieves a better trade off between privacy and
   utility. Finally, we run a set of experiments on real-world data sets,

Abstract = {{Smart Cities are examples of Cyber-Physical Systems whose goals include
   improvements in transportation, energy distribution, emergency response,

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{11, SI}},
Pages = {{1249-1257}},
Abstract = {{Public transportation automatic fare collection (AFC) systems are able
   to continuously record large amounts of passenger travel information,
   providing massive, low-cost data for research on regulations pertaining
   to public transport. These data can be used not only to analyze
   characteristics of passengers' trips but also to evaluate transport
   policies that promote a travel mode shift and emission reduction. In
   this study, models combining card, survey, and geographic information
   systems (GIS) data are established with a research focus on the private
   driving restriction policies being implemented in an ever-increasing
   number of cities. The study aims to evaluate the impact of these
   policies on the travel mode shift, as well as relevant carbon emission
   reductions. The private driving restriction policy implemented in
   Beijing is taken as an example. The impact of the restriction policy on
   the travel mode shift from cars to subways is analyzed through a model
   based on metro AFC data. The routing paths of these passengers are also
   analyzed based on the GIS method and on survey data, while associated
   carbon emission reductions are estimated. The analysis method used in
   this study can provide reference for the application of big data in
   evaluating transport policies.
   Implications: Motor vehicles have become the most prevalent source of
   emissions and subsequently air pollution within Chinese cities. The
   evaluation of the effects of driving restriction policies on the travel
   mode shift and vehicle emissions will be useful for other cities in the
   future. Transport big data, playing an important support role in
   estimating the travel mode shift and emission reduction considered, can
   help related departments to estimate the effects of traffic jam
   alleviation and environment improvement before the implementation of
   these restriction policies and provide a reference for relevant

   smart jitneys to station cars and automated shuttles, that would better
   serve America's increasingly diverse traveling public. The emergence of
   a host of microtransit services in recent years, like shared ride
   hailing and upmarket private minibuses, bears this out. More

Title = {{Smart City Pilot Projects: Exploring the Dimensions and Conditions of
   Scaling Up}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF URBAN TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{51-72}},
Abstract = {{In many cities, pilot projects are set up to test new technologies that
   help to address urban sustainability issues, improve the effectiveness
   of urban services, and enhance the quality of life of citizens. These
   projects, often labelled as smart city projects, are typically supported
   by municipalities, funded by subsidies, and run in partnerships. Many of
   the projects fade out after the pilot stage, and fail to generate
   scalable solutions that contribute to sustainable urban development. The
   lack of scaling is widely perceived as a major problem. In this paper,
   we analyze processes of upscaling, focusing on smart city pilot projects
   in which several partnerswith different missions, agendas, and
   incentivesjoin up. We start with a literature review, in which we
   identify three types of upscaling: roll-out, expansion, and replication,
   each with its own dynamics and degree of context sensitivity. The
   typology is further specified in relation to several conditions and
   requirements that can impact upscaling processes, and illustrated by a
   descriptive analysis of three smart city pilot projects developed in
   Amsterdam. The paper ends with conclusions and recommendations on pilot
   projects and partnership governance, and adds new perspectives on the
   debate regarding upscaling.}},

   Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{23710-23718}},
Abstract = {{A fully connected vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) establishes a strong
   foundation for the development of smart cities, where one of the main
   objectives is the improvement of the welfare of commuting passengers.
   The availability of a multi-hop path across a VANET system, through
   vehicle to-vehicle communication, depends mainly on the vehicular
   density and the willingness of vehicles to cooperate with one another.
   This paper proposes to minimize the path availability's dependence on
   vehicular density and cooperation, by utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles
   (UAVs). Particularly, this paper explores, both mathematically as well
   as through an extensive simulation study, the advantages of exploiting
   UAVs as store-carry-forward nodes so as to enhance the availability of a
   connectivity path as well as to reduce the end-to-end packet delivery
   delay. The obtained results shed clear light on the benefits emanating
   from the coupling of UAVs with vehicles in the context of a highly
   promising, innovative, and hybrid vehicular networking architecture.}},

Title = {{The Impact of Bottom-Up Parking Information Provision in a Real-Life
   Context: The Case of Antwerp}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{A number of studies have analyzed the possible impacts of bottom-up
   parking information or parking reservation systems on parking dynamics
   in abstract simulation environments. In this paper, we take these
   efforts one step further by investigating the impacts of these systems
   in a real-life context: the center of the city of Antwerp, Belgium. In
   our simulation, we assume that all on-street and off-street parking
   places are equipped with technology able to transmit their occupancy
   status to so-called smart cars, which can receive information and
   reserve a parking place. We employ PARKAGENT, an agent-based simulation
   model, to simulate the behavior of smart and regular cars. We obtain
   detailed data on parking demand from FEATHERS, an activity-based
   transport model. The simulation results show that parking information
   and reservation hardly impact search time but do reduce walking distance
   for smart cars, leading to a reduction in total parking time, that is,
   the sum of search time and walking time. Reductions in search time occur
   only in zones with high occupancy rates, while a drop in walking
   distance is especially observed in low occupancy areas. Societal
   benefits of parking information and reservation are limited, because of
   the low impact on search time and the possible negative health effects
   of reduced walking distance.}},

   Communication Between Vehicle Social Networks and Marketers}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{22796-22803}},
Abstract = {{Social users can be flexibly covered by a vehicle traveling along a
   certain trajectory in a city. This scenario provides opportunities for
   marketers to utilize vehicles as recommenders targeting potential
   customers. As a result, the vehicle social network (VSN) concept
   emerges. Since a marketer usually operates from a remote central office
   (CO), an effective communication system is urgently required to support
   data transmission between VSNs and COs. Orthogonal frequency division
   multiplexing (OFDM) is a modulation technique characterized by high
   spectral efficiency and dispersion resistance, and intensity modulation
   and direct detection (IM/DD) is an effective solution for optical OFDM
   (OOFDM) data transmission. Performing discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
   and discrete Hartley transform (DHT) operations can enable the
   satisfaction of various transmission requirements between a VSN and a
   CO. In this paper, we support the above claims through theoretical and
   simulation-based analyses. Moreover, a software-reconfigurable platform
   is established to achieve flexibility between DFT and DHT
   functionalities. Thus, diverse transmission requirements can be
   satisfied by modifying individual modules deployed in a single smart
   system instead of using multiple rigid network architectures. Simulated
   and experimental results both demonstrate the feasibility and
   effectiveness of our solutions.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{22892-22901}},
Abstract = {{To solve the problem of power shortage during load peak periods,
   policy-driven demand response (PDDR) is put forward in China. This paper
   proposes a novel PDDR scheme based on potential load values. An index of
   PDDR is established to identify the characteristics of industry load
   clients, who have signed contracts with power utilities. The
   deviation-maximization algorithm is introduced to quantify potential
   load values for these industry loads. Four different capabilities of
   PDDR are defined in this method, including daily peak shifting, weekly
   peak shifting, monthly peak shifting, and peak shedding separately.
   According to their different PDDR abilities, all clients will be
   assigned to four groups and the total load gap is resolved into four
   levels as well. By modeling the four means, respectively, this paper
   presents an effective PDDR scheme with multi-time scales. Taking Nanjing
   City, China, as an example, numerical simulations and practical results
   illustrate that the proposed method is an effective way to address the
   problem of power deficit during peak time, as well as to improve the

Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, we are experiencing
   rapid technological progress. Billions of devices are connected to each
   other, and our homes, cities, hospitals, and schools are getting smarter
   and smarter. However, to realize the IoT, several challenging issues
   such as connecting resource-constrained devices to the Internet must be
   resolved. Recently introduced Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN)
   technologies have been devised to resolve this issue. Among many LPWAN
   candidates, the Long Range (LoRa) is one of the most promising
   technologies. The Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a
   communication protocol for LoRa that provides basic security mechanisms.
   However, some security loopholes exist in LoRaWAN's key update and
   session key generation. In this paper, we propose a dual key-based
   activation scheme for LoRaWAN. It resolves the problem of key updates
   not being fully supported. In addition, our scheme facilitates each
   layer in generating its own session key directly, which ensures the
   independence of all layers. Real-world experimental results compared
   with the original scheme show that the proposed scheme is totally
   feasible in terms of delay and battery consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is becoming a vital part of
   utility distribution networks, allowing the development of smart cities.
   AMI consists of smart electric, gas, and water meters, and the devices
   are very limited in terms of battery, processing power, and memory. The
   deployment and operational needs of energy-constrained network
   infrastructures in smart water and gas metering systems require the use
   of routing mechanisms that consider energy consumption, minimize energy

   for energy-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose an energy-and
   congestion-aware routing metric for smart meter networks to be deployed

   selection mechanism that considers the residual energy and queue
   utilization of neighboring nodes. Minimizing power consumption will
   enhance network lifetime. The proposed scheme was evaluated with the
   Cooja Simulator 3.0 using random and grid topology. The simulation

Abstract = {{As the population in cities continues to increase rapidly, air pollution
   becomes a serious issue from public health to social economy. Among all
   pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various
   serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and
   cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban
   living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we
   present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring
   with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries.
   It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the
   world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its
   open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open
   hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the
   deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of
   low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison
   evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely
   with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities,
   we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing
   of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we
   provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness,
   trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking.

Abstract = {{The Internet of Vehicle (IoV) utilizes networks to conduct message

   integrates intelligent transportation systems in traffic signal control
   to aid emergency vehicles in more promptly arriving at its destination;
   2) in the case of traffic incidents, this paper's approach allows
   regular vehicles to obtain proof of incident from pertaining authorities

   traffic signal control and transmits important information to the
   certificate authority (CA) for storage. Given that RSUs are limited in
   computation ability and storage space, we can assess and filter the
   information before sending it to the CA, reducing RSUs computational
   burden and storage space usage. This paper satisfies IoVs network
   security requirements of authentication, non-repudiation, conditional

   City-to-City Network for Crime Analytics}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{20524-20535}},
Abstract = {{Today's cities generate tremendous amounts of data, thanks to a boom in
   affordable smart devices and sensors. The resulting big data creates
   opportunities to develop diverse sets of context-aware services and
   systems, ensuring smart city services are optimized to the dynamic city
   environment. Critical resources in these smart cities will be more
   rapidly deployed to regions in need, and those regions predicted to have
   an imminent or prospective need. For example, crime data analytics may
   be used to optimize the distribution of police, medical, and emergency
   services. However, as smart city services become dependent on data, they
   also become susceptible to disruptions in data streams, such as data
   loss due to signal quality reduction or due to power loss during data
   collection. This paper presents a dynamic network model for improving
   service resilience to data loss. The network model identifies
   statistically significant shared temporal trends across multivariate
   spatiotemporal data streams and utilizes these trends to improve data
   prediction performance in the case of data loss. Dynamics also allow the
   system to respond to changes in the data streams such as the loss or
   addition of new information flows. The network model is demonstrated by
   city-based crime rates reported in Montgomery County, MD, USA. A
   resilient network is developed utilizing shared temporal trends between
   cities to provide improved crime rate prediction and robustness to data
   loss, compared with the use of single city-based auto-regression. A
   maximum improvement in performance of 7.8 \% for Silver Spring is found
   and an average improvement of 5.6 \% among cities with high crime rates.
   The model also correctly identifies all the optimal network connections,
   according to prediction error minimization. City-to-city distance is
   designated as a predictor of shared temporal trends in crime and weather
   is shown to be a strong predictor of crime in Montgomery County.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{20763-20776}},
Abstract = {{Wireless body area network (WBAN) has attracted more and more attention
   to automatically and intelligently sense the health data of one person
   for supporting various health applications in smart cities. In the
   energy-constrained and heterogeneous WBAN system, there are three main
   issues: 1) the dynamic link characteristics due to the time-varying
   postures and environments; 2) the high energy efficiency requirement
   with considering the limited sensor battery; and 3) the high
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirement due to the importance of health
   data. To provide long service with high quality, the resource allocation
   scheme becomes indispensable with considering all these issues. In this
   paper, a mix-cost parameter is designed to evaluate the energy
   efficiency and QoS effectiveness, and a resource allocation problem is
   formulated to minimize the total mix-cost with optimizing the
   transmission rate, the transmission power, and the allocated time slots
   for each sensor. Then, a buffer-aware sensor evaluation method with low
   complexity is introduced to the resource allocation scheme to evaluate
   the sensor state in real time and then decide when applying for the
   resource reallocation by the hub for further improving both the
   short-term and the long-term QoS performance. Finally, a greedy
   sub-optimal resource allocation scheme is designed to reduce the time
   complexity of the resource allocation scheme. Simulation results are
   presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal
   buffer-aware resource allocation scheme as well as the greedy
   sub-optimal resource allocation scheme with low complexity.}},

Pages = {{21296-21311}},
Abstract = {{Fog computing (FC) is currently receiving a great deal of focused
   attention. FC can be viewed as an extension of cloud computing that
   services the edges of networks. A cooperative relationship among
   applications to collect data in a city is a fundamental research topic

   smart-sensor devices can be viewed as users in FC and can forward
   sensing data to the data center. In a traditional sensing process,
   rewards are paid according to the distances between the users and the
   platform, which can be seen as the existing solution. Because users with
   smart-sensing devices tend to participate in tasks with high rewards,
   the number of users in suburban regions is smaller, and data collection
   is sparse and cannot satisfy the demands of the tasks. However, there
   are many users in urban regions, which makes data collection costly and
   of low quality. In this paper, a cooperative-based model for smartphone
   tasks, named a cooperative-based model for smart-sensing tasks (CMST),
   is proposed to promote the quality of data collection in FC networks. In
   the CMST scheme, we develop an allocation method focused on improving
   the rewards in suburban regions. The rewards to each user with a smart
   sensor are distributed according to the region density. Moreover, for
   each task there is a cooperative relationship among the users; they
   cooperate with one another to reach the volume of data that the platform
   requires. Extensive experiments show that our scheme improves the
   overall data-coverage factor by 14.997\% to 31.46\%, and the platform
   cost can be reduced by 35.882\%.}},

Abstract = {{One of the basic elements of a Smart City is the urban infrastructure
   management system, in particular, systems of intelligent street lighting
   control. However, for their reliable operation, they require special
   care for the safety of their critical communication infrastructure. This
   article presents solutions for the detection of different kinds of
   abuses in network traffic of Smart Lighting infrastructure, realized by
   Power Line Communication technology. Both the structure of the examined
   Smart Lighting network and its elements are described. The article
   discusses the key security problems which have a direct impact on the
   correct performance of the Smart Lighting critical infrastructure. In
   order to detect an anomaly/attack, we proposed the usage of a
   statistical model to obtain forecasting intervals. Then, we calculated
   the value of the differences between the forecast in the estimated
   traffic model and its real variability so as to detect abnormal behavior
   (which may be symptomatic of an abuse attempt). Due to the possibility
   of appearance of significant fluctuations in the real network traffic,
   we proposed a procedure of statistical models update which is based on
   the criterion of interquartile spacing. The results obtained during the

Title = {{Constructing Transit Origin-Destination Matrices with Spatial Clustering}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2017}},
Number = {{2652}},
Pages = {{39-49}},
Abstract = {{So-called tap-in-tap-off smart card data have become increasingly
   available and popular as a result of the deployment of automatic fare
   collection systems on transit systems in many cities and areas
   worldwide. An opportunity to obtain much more accurate transit demand
   data than before has thus been opened to both researchers and
   practitioners. However, given that travelers in some cases can choose
   different origin and destination stations, as well as different transit
   lines, depending on their personal acceptable walking distances, being
   able to aggregate the demand of spatially close stations becomes
   essential when transit demand matrices are constructed. With the aim of
   investigating such problems using data-driven approaches, this paper
   proposes a k-means-based station aggregation method that can
   quantitatively determine the partitioning by considering both flow and
   spatial distance information. The method was applied to a case study of
   Haaglanden, Netherlands, with a specified objective of maximizing the
   ratio of average intra-cluster flow to average inter-cluster flow while
   maintaining the spatial compactness of all clusters. With a range of
   clustering of different K performed first using the distance feature, a
   distance-based metric and a flow-based metric were then computed and
   ultimately combined to determine the optimal number of clusters. The
   transit demand matrices constructed by implementing this method lay a
   foundation for further studies on short-term transit demand prediction
   and demand assignment.}},

   routing alternatives (possibly through real-time information), and (d)
   configuring traffic control strategies and tactics (possibly though big

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2017}},

Pages = {{78-85}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, a growing number of cities in China have successively
   rolled out bicycle-sharing systems to facilitate bicycle use, including
   not only metropolises but also some underdeveloped cities with
   populations of less than 1 million. One of those underdeveloped cities,
   Xuchang, launched its bicycle-sharing system in 2014. This service
   provides a convenient way for members to cycle for some of their short
   trips. Interest in the bicycle-sharing systems of metropolises is
   growing rapidly; however, studies on underdeveloped cities are still
   limited. This study investigated the factors influencing the adoption of
   a bicycle-sharing system in Xuchang, by analyzing massive smart card
   data from July 2014 to mid-April 2015 and 500 intercept survey
   questionnaires in April 2015. Different questions were ready for members
   and nonmembers in the questionnaires and the statistical results show
   the characteristics of users of the Xuchang bicycle-sharing system,
   including demographic characteristics, travel habits, and degree of
   satisfaction. Moreover, the space-time distribution characteristics of
   the Xuchang bicycle-sharing system were analyzed by dividing a massive
   data set into three groups: weekdays, weekends, and holidays. Results
   showed that compared with the clearly defined role of ``resolve the
   last-kilometer problem{''} in a metropolis, bicycle-sharing in
   under-developed cities acts as an alternative way of transportation
   rather than a transfer traffic mode. Results also showed that
   bicycle-sharing systems gained more popularity in underdeveloped cities
   than in metropolises because of the smaller extent of egression,
   resident travel habits, the traffic environment, and so on.}},

Journal = {{WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{With the development of ubiquitous computing, recommendation systems
   have become essential tools in assisting users in discovering services
   they would find interesting. This process is highly dynamic with an
   increasing number of services, distributed over networks, bringing the
   problems of cold start and sparsity for service recommendation to a new
   level. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a hybrid service
   recommendation prototype utilizing user and item side information, which
   naturally constitute a heterogeneous information network (HIN) for use
   in the emerging ubiquitous consumer wireless world (UCWW) wireless

   described. Two recommendation models defined at both global and
   personalized level are proposed, with model learning based on the
   Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). A subset of the Yelp dataset is
   utilized to simulate UCWW data and evaluate the proposed models.
   Empirical studies show that the proposed recommendation models

Journal = {{WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly used in smart cities
   which involve multiple city services having quality of service (QoS)
   requirements. When misbehaving devices exist, the performance of current
   delivery protocols degrades significantly. Nonetheless, themajority of
   existing schemes either ignore the faulty behaviors' variability and
   time-variance in city environments or focus on homogeneous traffic for
   traditional data services (simple textmessages) rather than city
   services (health care units, traffic monitors, and video surveillance).
   We consider the problem of fault-aware multiservice delivery, in which
   the network performs secure routing and rate control in terms of fault
   activity dynamic metric. To this end, we first design a distributed
   framework to estimate the fault activity information based on the
   effects of nondeterministic faulty behaviors and to incorporate these
   estimates into the service delivery. Then we present a fault activity
   geographic opportunistic routing (FAGOR) algorithm addressing a wide
   range of misbehaviors. We develop a leaky-hop model and design a fault
   activity rate-control algorithm for heterogeneous traffic to allocate
   resources, while guaranteeing utility fairness among multiple city
   services. Finally, we demonstrate the significant performance of our
   scheme in routing performance, effective utility, and utility fairness

Abstract = {{Smart cities are becoming a reality. Various aspects of modern cities
   are being automated and integrated with information and communication
   technologies to achieve higher functionality, optimized resources
   utilization, and management, and improved quality of life for the
   residents. Smart cities rely heavily on utilizing various software,
   hardware, and communication technologies to improve the operations in
   areas, such as healthcare, transportation, energy, education, logistics,
   and many others, while reducing costs and resources consumption. One of
   the promising technologies to support such efforts is the Cloud of
   Things (CoT). CoT provides a platform for linking the cyber parts of a
   smart city that are executed on the cloud with the physical parts of the
   smart city, including residents, vehicles, power grids, buildings, water
   networks, hospitals, and other resources. Another useful technology is
   Fog Computing, which extends the traditional Cloud Computing paradigm to
   the edge of the network to enable localized and real-time support for
   operating-enhanced smart city services. However, proper integration and
   efficient utilization of CoT and Fog Computing is not an easy task. This
   paper discusses how the service-oriented middleware (SOM) approach can
   help resolve some of the challenges of developing and operating smart
   city services using CoT and Fog Computing. We propose an SOM called
   SmartCityWare for effective integration and utilization of CoT and Fog
   Computing. SmartCityWare abstracts services and components involved in
   smart city applications as services accessible through the
   service-oriented model. This enhances integration and allows for
   flexible inclusion and utilization of the various services needed in a
   smart city application. In addition, we discuss the implementation and
   experimental issues of SmartCityWare and demonstrate its use through
   examples of smart city applications.}},

Abstract = {{The recent advances in sensing and communication technologies such as
   wireless sensor networks (WSN) have enabled low-priced distributed

   annotate the activities conducted at these locations. The remaining

   results indicate that the proposed approach can capture citywide

   to a particular city (Stavanger, Norway). The data show that the
   smartness approach is strongly tied to innovation, technology, and

Journal = {{WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Vehicular networks, as a significant technology in intelligent
   transportation systems, improve the convenience, efficiency, and safety
   of driving in smart cities. However, because of the high velocity, the
   frequent topology change, and the limited bandwidth, it is difficult to
   efficiently propagate data in vehicular networks. This paper proposes a
   data dissemination scheme based on fuzzy logic and network coding for
   vehicular networks, named SFN. It uses fuzzy logic to compute a
   transmission ability for each vehicle by comprehensively considering the
   effects of three factors: the velocity change rate, the velocity
   optimization degree, and the channel quality. Then, two nodes with high
   abilities are selected as primary backbone and slave backbone in every
   road segment, which propagate data to other vehicles in this segment and
   forward them to the backbones in the next segment. The backbone network
   helps to increase the delivery ratio and avoid invalid transmissions.
   Additionally, network coding is utilized to reduce transmission overhead
   and accelerate data retransmission in interbackb one forwarding and
   intrasegment broadcasting. Experiments show that, compared with existing
   schemes, SFN has a high delivery ratio and a short dissemination delay,
   while the backbone network keeps high reliability.}},

Abstract = {{Technology has undergone rapid development in the past several decades
   and we are now at a point where many technologies are available to help
   create smart cities. Many technology companies and research institutions
   as well as political organizations are currently discussing this field
   with the highest priority. One can say that the biggest challenge to
   smart cities is not technologies themselves, but the merging of all
   available technologies into one symbiotic unit that fulfills the
   expected objectives. Smart cities are about connecting subsystems,
   sharing and evaluating data, and providing quality of life and
   satisfaction to citizens. We have various models of transportation
   systems, optimizations of energy usage, street lighting systems,
   building management systems, urban transport optimizations, however
   currently, such models are dealt with separately. In this paper, we
   provide an overview of the smart city concept and discuss why
   Multi-agent systems are the right tool for the modeling of smart cities.
   The biggest challenge is in connecting and linking particular subsystems
   within a smart city. In this paper, a modeling of a smart city building
   blocks is provided and demonstrated with one particular example - a
   smart street lighting system. Focus will be on the decomposition of the
   system into subsystems as well as a description of particular modules.
   We propose to build models and since each individual entity can be
   modeled as an agent with its beliefs, desires and intentions, we suggest

Abstract = {{Smart city is a city which is designed to meet the people's demands. In
   addition to use of sources efficiently, trends of people are also a need
   that smart city shouldmeet. Buying personalized products in a cheap and
   fast way is a demand of people of today. Mass customization, which is
   defined as the personalization of products, achievesmaking the
   tailor-made products cheaper. In this study, we propose a new approach
   for mass customization with the integration of smart retail and smart
   production. With removing the operators and actualizing the progress
   autonomously, it is aimed to reduce the waiting time of customers.
   Because less waiting time means that there are more mass-customization
   customers, and this is expected to increase the popularity of mass
   customization. Thus, reducing wastes and increasing productivity are
   aimed. This study also constitutes the infrastructure that enables a
   production system to autonomously perform all stages from order to
   delivery. With the given scenarios, challenges and advantages of desired
   approach are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile healthcare social networks (MHSN) integrated with connected
   medical sensors and cloud-based health data storage provide preventive

Abstract = {{As the integration of smart mobile devices to the Internet of Things
   (IoT) applications is becoming widespread, mobile device usage,
   interactions with other devices, and mobility patterns of users carry
   significant amount of information about the daily routines of the users
   who are in possession of these devices. This rich set of data, if
   observed over a time period, can be used to effectively verify a user.
   In previous works, verification of users on personalized electronic
   devices via biometric properties, such as fingerprint and iris, has been
   successfully employed to increase the security of access. However, with
   the integration of social networks with the IoT infrastructure and their
   popularity on smart handheld devices, identification based on behavior
   over social networks is emerging as a novel concept. In this paper, we
   propose an intelligent add-on for the smart devices to enable continuous
   verification of users. In the experiments, we use data from built-in
   sensors and usage statistics of five different social networking
   applications on mobile devices. The collected feature set is aggregated
   over time and analyzed using machine learning techniques. We show that
   when smart devices are equipped with continuous verification
   intelligence, it is possible to verify users with less than 10\% false
   rejection probabilities, and the users can keep using the devices with
   no interruption for biometric authentication 90\% of the time. In the
   case of anomalous behavioral patterns, the proposed system can verify

   Cellular Networks in Dense Urban Scenarios}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{13001-13009}},
Abstract = {{Communication plays a significant role in terms of providing
   connectivity for urban users as well as sensors in smart cities. It has
   been shown that better communication capability for vehicular users can
   be obtained by introducing moving relays (MRs). With MRs, it is possible
   for macro base stations and moving relays to serve non-vehicular
   macro-users by performing coordinated multipoint (CoMP) joint
   transmission (JT). A bias-based CoMP scheme for MR enabled cellular
   network is analyzed in this paper. Motivated by antenna design
   constraints, in this paper, we assume that the outdoor antenna system of
   the MR can only be used for the moving backhaul link, i.e., the
   in-vehicle antenna system is also serving the non-vehicular macro-users.
   Using the stochastic geometry approach, a tractable model of the network
   is proposed. Based on the proposed model, integral expressions for
   CoMP-JT probability and coverage probability of non-vehicular macro user
   equipment are derived. Simulations verify the accuracy of the derived
   expressions. The results show that the probability for macro user
   equipment to be served with CoMP-JT is up to 70\% when the intensity of
   MRs is ten times that of MBSs. This paper also includes a performance
   comparison among the analyzed scheme and related works. CoMP-JT with MRs
   provides better coverage performance for nearby macro user equipment. It
   can be found that the coverage gain of CoMP increases when the intensity
   of MRs increases within a certain range. Simulation results provide
   insights for practical system design in smart cities, such as the
   optimal MR intensity and the feasibility for opening access of MRs to
   macro user equipment.}},

Title = {{Mining Human Activity Patterns From Smart Home Big Data for Health Care
   Applications}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{13131-13141}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, there is an ever-increasing migration of people to urban
   areas. Health care service is one of the most challenging aspects that
   is greatly affected by the vast influx of people to city centers.
   Consequently, cities around the world are investing heavily in digital
   transformation in an effort to provide healthier ecosystems for people.
   In such a transformation, millions of homes are being equipped with
   smart devices (e.g., smart meters, sensors, and so on), which generate
   massive volumes of fine-grained and indexical data that can be analyzed
   to support smart city services. In this paper, we propose a model that
   utilizes smart home big data as a means of learning and discovering
   human activity patterns for health care applications. We propose the use
   of frequent pattern mining, cluster analysis, and prediction to measure
   and analyze energy usage changes sparked by occupants' behavior. Since
   people's habits are mostly identified by everyday routines, discovering
   these routines allows us to recognize anomalous activities that may
   indicate people's difficulties in taking care for themselves, such as
   not preparing food or not using a shower/bath. This paper addresses the
   need to analyze temporal energy consumption patterns at the appliance
   level, which is directly related to human activities. For the evaluation
   of the proposed mechanism, this paper uses the U.K. Domestic Appliance
   Level Electricity data set time series data of power consumption
   collected from 2012 to 2015 with the time resolution of 6 s for five
   houses with 109 appliances from Southern England. The data from smart
   meters are recursively mined in the quantum/data slice of 24 h, and the
   results are maintained across successive mining exercises. The results
   of identifying human activity patterns from appliance usage are
   presented in detail in this paper along with the accuracy of short- and
   long-term predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability has increasingly become a major consideration in location
   planning, directing urban distribution, and regional development. This
   scenario can be regarded as a group decision making (GDM) voting system
   case. Taking into account artificial thinking and the characteristics of
   the case, this paper introduces the 2-tuple linguistic intuitionistic
   preference relation (LIPR) to resolve the GDM voting system
   circumstance. Firstly, the Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm based
   operational laws and the 2-tuple linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy
   weighted geometric (ATS-2TLIFWG) operator are developed to aggregate and
   rank linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (LIFNs). Secondly, various
   concepts related to the 2-tuple LIPR and geometric consistency are
   extended for further analysis, including the completely geometrically
   consistent 2-tuple LIPR, the acceptably geometrically consistent 2-tuple
   LIPR, and the consistency index. Thirdly, motivated by the adverse
   impact of contradictory individual comparisons, we investigate a
   consistency modification algorithm to approximate the acceptable
   geometric consistency. Fourthly, we consider a consensus reaching
   algorithm as a unanimous elimination technique in the GDM procedure. A
   GDM algorithm, involving a consistency modification process as well as a
   consensus reaching process, and overall value aggregation process, is
   embedded into the GDM voting system. Finally, we conduct an illustrative
   example concerning smart city location planning, and employ the proposed
   algorithms in a comparison analysis to illustrate their feasibility and

Pages = {{11805-11816}},
Abstract = {{Body area networks, including smart sensors, are widely reshaping health
   applications in the new era of smart cities. To meet increasing security
   and privacy requirements, physiological signal-based biometric human
   identification is gaining tremendous attention. This paper focuses on
   two major impediments: the signal processing technique is usually both
   complicated and data-dependent and the feature engineering is
   time-consuming and can fit only specific datasets. To enable a
   data-independent and highly generalizable signal processing and feature
   learning process, a novel wavelet domain multiresolution convolutional
   neural network is proposed. Specifically, it allows for blindly
   selecting a physiological signal segment for identification purpose,
   avoiding the complicated signal fiducial characteristics extraction
   process. To enrich the data representation, the random chosen signal
   segment is then transformed to the wavelet domain, where multiresolution
   time-frequency representation is achieved. An auto-correlation operation
   is applied to the transformed data to remove the phase difference as the
   result of the blind segmentation operation. Afterward, a multiresolution
   1-D-convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) is introduced to
   automatically learn the intrinsic hierarchical features from the wavelet
   domain raw data without datadependent and heavy feature engineering, and
   perform the user identification task. The effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithm is thoroughly evaluated on eight electrocardiogram datasets
   with diverse behaviors, such as with or without severe heart diseases,
   and with different sensor placement methods. Our evaluation is much more
   extensive than the state-of-the-art works, and an average identification
   rate of 93.5\% is achieved. The proposed multiresolution 1-D-CNN
   algorithm can effectively identify human subjects, even from randomly
   selected signal segments and without heavy feature engineering. This
   paper is expected to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
   applying the blind signal processing and deep learning techniques to

Abstract = {{In recent years, the Smart City concept has become popular for its
   promise to improve the quality of life of urban citizens. The concept
   involves multiple disciplines, such as Smart health care, Smart
   transportation, and Smart community. Most services in Smart Cities,
   especially in the Smart healthcare domain, require the real-time
   sharing, processing, and analyzing of Big Healthcare Data for
   intelligent decision making. Therefore, a strong wireless and mobile
   communication infrastructure is necessary to connect and access Smart
   healthcare services, people, and sensors seamlessly, anywhere at any
   time. In this scenario, mobile cloud computing (MCC) can play a vital
   role by offloading Big Healthcare Data related tasks, such as sharing,
   processing, and analysis, from mobile applications to cloud resources,
   ensuring quality of service demands of end users. Such resource
   migration, which is also termed virtual machine (VM) migration, is
   effective in the Smart healthcare scenario in Smart Cities. In this
   paper, we propose an ant colony optimization-based joint VM migration
   model for a heterogeneous, MCC-based Smart Healthcare system in Smart
   City environment. In this model, the users mobility and provisioned VM
   resources in the cloud address the VM migration problem. We also present
   a thorough performance evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of
   our proposed model compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.}},

Abstract = {{A set of software/hardware packages developed by IT companies for the

   presumptions about what constitutes appropriate knowledge and forms of

   interface between the urban and IT requires a broader historical and
   theoretical perspective, the article traces the ways in which the city
   has been diagrammed as a space of power since the nineteenth century and
   highlights the antecedents of Urban OS present across different domains
   of lifeparticularly in military and corporate enterprises. Relaying the
   urban as an efficient logistical enterprise, and operating as a piloting
   device (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987), the Urban OS appears as an emerging
   urban diagram introducing an informational diagrammatic of control. We
   focus on five archetypal framings of how Urban OS envision the city,
   illustrating how a new corporate rationality of control based on

Title = {{Certificateless Cryptographic Protocols for Efficient Drone-Based Smart
   City Applications}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{3721-3749}},
Abstract = {{Smart cities aim to improve the quality of urban services and their
   energy efficiency by utilizing information and communication
   technologies. In such context, drones can be utilized to support various
   services, such as traffic monitoring, search/rescue, and surveillance,
   by communicating with many different smart objects like sensors.
   Securing such communications is crucial to making correct decisions and
   requires efficient cryptographic protocols. However, the design of such
   protocols must consider: 1) the mobility and the limited battery of
   drones and 2) the constrained resources of smart objects. In this paper,
   a suite of cryptographic protocols is presented to deal with three
   different communication scenarios: one-to-one, one-to-many, and
   many-to-one. For one-to-one, we propose an efficient Certificateless
   Signcryption Tag Key Encapsulation Mechanism (eCLSC-TKEM) that supports
   authenticated key agreement, non-repudiation, and user revocation.
   eCLSC-TKEM reduces the time required to establish a shared key between a
   drone and a smart object by minimizing the computational overhead at the
   smart object. For one-to-many, we propose a Certificateless
   Multi-Recipient Encryption Scheme (CL-MRES) by which a drone can
   efficiently send privacy-sensitive data to multiple smart objects. For
   many-to-one, we present a Certificateless Data Aggregation (CLDA)
   protocol, which allows drones to efficiently collect data from hundreds
   of smart objects. Also, for efficiency, we propose a dual channel
   strategy that allows many smart objects to concurrently execute our
   protocols. We evaluate eCLSC-TKEM via a smart parking management
   test-bed. Also, we have implemented CL-MRES and CLDA on a board with a
   graphics processing unit (GPU) and show their GPU-accelerated
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Current evolutions in the Internet of Things and cloud computing make it
   believable to build smart cities and homes. Smart cities provide smart
   technologies to residents for the improved and healthier life, where
   smart healthcare systems cannot be ignored due to rapidly growing
   elderly people around the world. Smart healthcare systems can be
   cost-effective and helpful in the optimal use of healthcare resources.
   The voice is a primary source of communication and any complication in
   the production of voice affects the personal as well as professional
   life of a person. Early screening of voice through an automatic voice
   disorder detection system may save life of a person. In this paper, an
   automatic voice disorder detection system to monitor the resident of all
   age group and professional backgrounds is implemented. The proposed
   system detects the voice disorder by determining the source signal from
   the speech through the linear prediction analysis. The analysis
   calculates the features from normal and disordered subjects. Based on
   these features, the spectrum is computed, which provided distribution of
   energy in normal and voice disordered subjects to differentiate between
   them. It is found that lower frequencies from 1 to 1562 Hz contributes
   significantly in the detection of voice disorders. The system is
   developed by using sustained vowel and running speech so that it can be
   deployed in a real world. The obtained accuracy for the detection of
   voice disorder with the sustained vowel is 99.94\% +/- 0.1, and that is
   for running speech is 99.75\% +/- 0.8.}},

Title = {{Increasing smart city competitiveness and sustainability through
   managing structural capital}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{693-707}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore and discuss possible
   solutions to integrate the concepts of smart city (SC) and intellectual
   capital management, especially referring to structural capital. On the
   basis of this, the authors propose a theoretical framework that
   highlights the relevance of structural capital for strategic and
   operational planning of smarter cities.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a neuropsychological analogy, the
   authors assume that the development of SCs corresponds to the
   development of a sensorial or even a nervous system for cities based on
   their structural capital, and the development of city intellectual
   capital (CIC) corresponds to a further phase of the cities' mind
   development. The authors propose a practical framework that combines the
   concepts of city nervous system and city mind. It can be used as an
   instrument for project management. In this model, sensorial data -
   associated with the implementation of cities' sensorial systems - should
   naturally contribute with open data to the development of higher
   abstract functions that in turn supports the creation of CIC.
   Findings - This paper highlights the interrelations between intellectual
   capital (IC) (especially its structural component) and SC and their
   synergic capability of improving both an SC's competitiveness and
   sustainability, and by this illustrates the benefits of combining both
   concepts in a common theoretical framework.
   Research limitations/implications - Given the paper's theoretical
   nature, the empirical validation of the proposed framework is missing.
   This limitation will be addressed in forthcoming empirical research.
   Originality/value - By proposing a framework that combines the concepts
   of SC and IC, the paper contributes to theory development regarding the
   strategic management of cities and the application of IC.}},

   histograms of the blocks are concatenated to produce a feature vector of
   the face image. An optional feature-selection technique selects the most
   dominant features, which are then fed into two classifiers: a Gaussian
   mixture model and a support vector machine. The scores of these
   classifiers are fused by weight to produce a confidence score, which is
   used to make decisions about the facial expression's type. Several

Pages = {{9348-9358}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the optimal energy beamforming and time
   assignment in radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) wireless
   powered sensor networks for smart cities, where sensor nodes (SNs) first
   harvest energy from a sink node, and then transmit their collected data
   to the sink node via time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) manner by
   using the harvested energy. In order to achieve green system design, we
   formulate a problem to minimize the energy requirement of the sink node
   to support transmission between the sink node and the SNs under data
   amount constraint and EH constraint. For practical design, the energy
   consumed by circuit and information processing is also considered. Since
   the problem is non-convex, we use semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method
   to relax it into a convex optimization problem and then solve it
   efficiently. We theoretically prove that when the number of SNs are not
   greater than two, the relaxed problem guarantees rank-one constraint and
   when the number of SNs exceeds two, our obtained results are very close
   to the optimal ones. Simulation results show that when the data amount
   is relatively small, the energy consumed by circuit and information
   processing affects the system performance greatly, but for a relatively
   large data amount, the energy requirement of the sink node on its own
   signal processing is affected very limited and the system energy
   requirement is dominated by the transmit power consumption at the SNs.
   Furthermore, we also discuss the effects of the other parameters on the
   system performance, which provide some useful insights in future smart
   city planning.}},

   attributes and platforms proposed in the current literature for the
   standing-alone FC and IoE paradigms. Second, by leveraging some use
   cases as illustrative examples, we point out that the integration of the
   FC and IoE paradigms may give rise to opportunities for new applications

   development around LRT stations. Analysis of parcel-level land-use data
   from 2005-2014 revealed a spike in commercial development along the

   opening. Land-use development along the newer light rail corridors was
   more modest and not considerably different than the control corridors.
   Small changes in the levels of high-density residential housing and
   land-use mix near light rail stations indicated that efforts to
   encourage transit-oriented development have not yet had much effect.}},

Abstract = {{This article analyzes the impact of changing housing and neighborhood
   characteristics on the accessibility of neighborhood businesses using
   Long Beach, California, as a case study. Although advocates of smart
   growth and New Urbanism encourage land use mixing, aggregate-level
   analysis can be too coarse to pick up on fine-grained aspects of urban
   streetscapes. This study uses assessor parcel records and a point-based
   business establishment data set to analyze city-wide patterns of
   accessibility from individual dwelling units to thirty-one types of
   neighborhood businesses, including grocery stores, service shops, drug
   stores, doctor's offices, and banks. Regression results compare
   parcel-level and neighborhood-level drivers of accessibility between
   2006 and 2015 to gauge the aggregated effect of recent economic,
   demographic, and built environment changes on this aspect of urban
   spatial structure. Larger homes in older, multiunit buildings and higher
   income neighborhoods show substantial increases in accessibility to most
   establishment types, suggesting a trend toward both greater
   accessibility and larger dwelling unitsdespite the traditional trade-off
   between access and space. Although gradual increases in home and
   business density increased overall accessibility over this period,
   weaker neighborhood-level results indicate that this trend is less
   pronounced in high-poverty and non-white areas.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{591-606}},
Abstract = {{The time has come for renewed emphasis on the life cycle management of
   the physical aspects of transportation infrastructure. The urgency for
   this new direction is underscored by the fact that the physical
   transportation network at most countries constitutes the most valuable
   publicly owned infrastructure and efforts must be made to keep it
   resilient to possible threats of man-made or natural disasters over its
   service life so that the movement of people and goods can continue
   uninterrupted to serve the economy and maintain the quality of life. The
   concept of transportation asset management (TAM) is a systematic process
   based on multiple disciplines (engineering, finance, operations research
   and economics), to make cost-effective repair and replacement decisions
   geared towards a sustained state of good repair over the infrastructure
   life cycle. This paper first argues for the continued application of
   asset management principles for transportation infrastructure in the new
   millennium. The paper then discusses the development cycle of
   transportation infrastructure as a prelude to a discussion of the key
   functions of an asset management system. The paper proceeds to identify
   the components (asset types) and elements of asset management (that is,
   the tasks that are carried out by an asset manager in an agency). The
   challenges and opportunities of asset management in the new millennium
   are then discussed. These include, among others, the specter of climate
   change, infrastructure resilience, sustainable development of
   transportations assets, the emerging era of autonomous vehicles and
   smart cities, and the consideration of transportation assets as a
   holistic system-of-systems. These issues are addressed in the context of
   the availability of big data and advances in analytical techniques and
   computing power.}},

Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{779-793}},
Abstract = {{Accounts by geographers of the ways in which urban spaces are digitally
   mediated have proliferated in the last few years. This significant body
   of work pays particular attention to the production of urban space by
   software and digital hardware, and geographers have drawn on various
   kinds of posthumanist philosophies to theorize the agency of the
   technological nonhuman. The agency of the human, however, has been left
   undertheorized in this work, often appearing in the form of excessive
   resistance to the agency granted to the digital. This article
   contributes to understanding the digital mediation of cities by
   theorizing a specifically posthuman agency; that is, a human agency both
   mediated through technics and diverse. Drawing on the philosophy of
   Stiegler as well as a range of feminist digital scholarship, the article
   conceptualizes posthuman agency as always already coconstituted with
   technologies. Posthumans are simultaneously individuated and
   exteriorized in that coconstitution, and this permits agency understood
   as reinvention. The article also insists that such sociotechnical agency
   is differentiated, particularly in terms of the spatialities and
   temporalities through which it is organized. It concludes by arguing
   that geographers must reconfigure their understanding of digitally
   mediated cities and acknowledge the inventiveness and diversity of urban
   posthuman agency.}},

Abstract = {{Low power wide area (LPWA) networks are attracting a lot of attention
   primarily because of their ability to offer affordable connectivity to
   the low-power devices distributed over very large geographical areas. In
   realizing the vision of the Internet of Things, LPWA technologies
   complement and sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short
   range wireless technologies in performance for various emerging smart
   city and machine-to-machine applications. This review paper presents the
   design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies
   exploit to offer wide-area coverage to low-power devices at the expense
   of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the
   standardization activities carried out by different standards
   development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the
   industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g.,
   LORa Alliance, WEIGHTLESS-SIG, and DASH7 alliance). We further note that
   LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing similar
   limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research
   challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While
   the proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with
   large nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement
   of the research community in solving problems that will shape the
   connectivity of tens of billions of devices in the next decade.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the first two decades of research on smart cities

   perspective on smart cities. The second path, instead, stands on the
   gray literature produced by the American business community and relates
   to a techno-centric understanding of the subject. Divided along such
   paths, the future development of this new and promising field of
   research risks being undermined. For while the bibliometric analysis
   indicates that smart cities are emerging as a fast-growing topic of

Abstract = {{Developing resilience in built human environments is a complex

Abstract = {{In smart city applications, huge numbers of devices need to be connected

   specifies that Machine Type Communication (MTC) should be used to handle
   data transmission among a large number of devices. However, the data

   congestion problem. To tackle this problem, the use of Access Class
   Barring (ACB) is recommended to restrict the number of access attempts
   allowed in data transmission by utilizing strategic parameters. In this
   paper, we model the problem of determining the strategic parameters with
   a reinforcement learning algorithm. In our model, the system evolves to
   minimize both the collision rate and the access delay. The experimental

Abstract = {{The uptake of mobile media with internet connection has increased
   rapidly in almost every part of the world, and this has significantly
   changed how public transport passengers use their travel time. Studies
   have documented that use of mobile information and communication
   technologies (ICT) while traveling has the potential to enrich use of
   travel time and in some cases, strengthen positive attitudes towards
   public transport. The alternative hypothesisthat mobile communication
   technologies make travelers more critical and demanding, e.g., due to
   the risk of interferencehas so far hardly been explored through
   empirical studies. Based on a web-based survey of travelers in two of
   the largest cities in Norway (Oslo and Trondheim), this paper
   investigates how use of smart devices are related to general attitudes
   toward public transportation services. A segmentation of travelers in
   three clusters based on their mobile use habits, shows that the most
   active group of mobile media usersa group of younger and middle-aged
   urban dwellerswere those who bore the most critical attitudes to the
   public transport services. In contrast, the groups that used their
   mobile phones rarely, or less actively, on their public transport trips
   were more satisfied. The findings suggests that a new generation of
   equipped travelers has developed expectations regarding their public
   transport journeys that service providers might have problems to fulfill
   in current times. Thus, there is a risk of the most active smartphone
   users developing negative attitudes to public transport if (or when)
   their experiences are not improved.}},

Abstract = {{India has shown rapid economic development and this has forced the

   an efficient and novel approach for the detection of moving vehicles as
   well as estimation of their speeds for detection of any speed limit
   violation by using a single camera in daylight or properly illuminated

   passing through the surveillance area and maintains the record of
   vehicles position. The Region of Interest (ROI) of the approach is the
   dark shaded area formed under the vehicles road clearance area instead
   of the vehicles. The average detection accuracy achieved by proposed
   approach is 93.32\%. This is on an average 7.54\% higher than other

   minimize the scope of any false positive detection on both sides of

   92.2\%. The tracking accuracy achieved by the proposed approach is on an
   average 2.2\% higher than the other leading approaches. The average

Title = {{Empirical Study and Modeling of Vehicular Communications at
   Intersections in the 5 GHz Band}},
Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Event warnings are critical in the context of ITS, being dependent on
   reliable and low-delay delivery ofmessages to nearby vehicles. One of
   the main challenges to address in this context is intersection
   management. Since buildings will severely hinder signals in the 5GHz
   band, it becomes necessary to transmit at the exact moment a vehicle is
   at the center of an intersection to maximize delivery chances. However,
   GPS inaccuracy, among other problems, complicates the achievement of
   this goal. In this paper we study this problem by first analyzing
   different intersection types, studying the vehicular communications
   performance in each type of intersection through real scenario
   experiments. Obtained results show that intersection-related
   communications depend on the distances to the intersection and
   line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. Also, depending on the physical
   characteristics of intersections, the presented blockages introduce
   different degrees of hampering to message delivery. Based on the
   modeling of the different intersection types, we then study the expected
   success ratio when notifying events at intersections. In general, we
   find that effective propagation of messages at intersections is
   possible, even in urban canyons and despite GPS errors, as long as
   rooftop antennas are used to compensate for poor communication
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Fog computing-enhanced Internet of Things (IoT) has recently received
   considerable attention, as the fog devices deployed at the network edge
   can not only provide low latency, location awareness but also improve
   real-time and quality of services in IoT application scenarios.
   Privacy-preserving data aggregation is one of typical fog computing
   applications in IoT, and many privacy-preserving data aggregation
   schemes have been proposed in the past years. However, most of them only
   support data aggregation for homogeneous IoT devices, and cannot
   aggregate hybrid IoT devices' data into one in some real IoT
   applications. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present a
   lightweight privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme, called
   Lightweight Privacy-preserving Data Aggregation, for fog
   computing-enhanced IoT. The proposed LPDA is characterized by employing
   the homomorphic Paillier encryption, Chinese Remainder Theorem, and
   one-way hash chain techniques to not only aggregate hybrid IoT devices'
   data into one, but also early filter injected false data at the network
   edge. Detailed security analysis shows LPDA is really secure and

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{3475-3489}},
Abstract = {{Smart cities are a future reality for municipalities around the world.
   Healthcare services play a vital role in the transformation of
   traditional cities into smart cities. In this paper, we present a
   ubiquitous and quality computer-aided blood analysis service for the
   detection and counting of white blood cells (WBCs) in blood samples.
   WBCs also called leukocytes or leucocytes are the cells of the immune
   system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious
   disease and foreign invaders. Analysis of leukocytes provides valuable
   information to medical specialists, helping them in diagnosing different
   important hematic diseases, such as AIDS and blood cancer (Leukaemia).
   However, this task is prone to errors and can be timeconsuming. A
   mobile-cloud-assisted detection and classification of leukocytes from
   blood smear images can enhance accuracy and speed up the detection of
   WBCs. In this paper, we propose a smartphone-based cloud-assisted
   resource aware framework for localization of WBCs within microscopic
   blood smear images using a trained multi-class ensemble classification
   mechanism in the cloud. In the proposed framework, nucleus is first
   segmented, followed by extraction of texture, statistical, and wavelet
   features. Finally, the detected WBCs are categorized into five classes:
   basophil, eosinophil, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte. Experimental
   results on numerous benchmark databases validate the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed system in comparison to the other
   state-of-the-art schemes.}},

   Smart Cities rely strongly on strategies and solutions enabled by ICT5

   data alone, though a relevant component of these strategies, cannot
   provide enough incentives for the engagement of citizens necessary to
   establish a collaborative and open governance system; data need to be

   this paper is to investigate how open data together with simple and
   standardised elaborations and innovative visualisation techniques may be
   used to provide new and updated services to citizens and communities:
   free and readily available services based on the wealth of information
   `owned' by local governments. Adopting a design science research
   methodology we develop and test a collaborative ICT-based tool called
   UrbanSense. We use it to highlight how systemic connections between

   on the feedforwarding of open data integrated with basic elaborations

   prompts citizens to feedback new information in real-time to the city

Abstract = {{Ubiquity of mobile devices with rich sensory capabilities has given rise
   to the mobile crowdsensing ( MCS) concept, in which a central authority
   ( the platform) and its participants ( mobile users) work
   collaboratively to acquire sensory data over a wide geographic area.
   Recent research in MCS highlights the following facts: 1) a utility
   metric can be defined for both the platform and the users, quantifying
   the value received by either side; 2) incentivizing the users to
   participate is a non- trivial challenge; 3) correctness and truthfulness
   of the acquired data must be verified, because the users might provide
   incorrect or inaccurate data, whether due to malicious intent or
   malfunctioning devices; and 4) an intricate relationship exists among
   platform utility, user utility, user reputation, and data
   trustworthiness, suggesting a co- quantification of these inter- related
   metrics. In this paper, we study two existing approaches that quantify
   crowd- sensed data trustworthiness, based on statistical and vote- based
   user reputation scores. We introduce a new metric - collaborative
   reputation scores-to expand this definition. Our simulation results show
   that collaborative reputation scores can provide an effective
   alternative to the previously proposed metrics and are able to extend

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance knowledge of the
   transformative potential of big data on city-based transport models. The
   central question guiding this paper is: how could big data transform
   smart city transport operations? In answering this question the authors
   present initial results from a Markov study. However the authors also
   suggest caution in the transformation potential of big data and
   highlight the risks of city and organizational adoption. A theoretical
   framework is presented together with an associated scenario which guides
   the development of a Markov model.
   Design/methodology/approach - A model with several scenarios is
   developed to explore a theoretical framework focussed on matching the
   transport demands (of people and freight mobility) with city transport
   service provision using big data. This model was designed to illustrate
   how sharing transport load (and capacity) in a smart city can improve
   efficiencies in meeting demand for city services.
   Findings - This modelling study is an initial preliminary stage of the
   investigation in how big data could be used to redefine and enable new
   operational models. The study provides new understanding about load
   sharing and optimization in a smart city context. Basically the authors
   demonstrate how big data could be used to improve transport efficiency
   and lower externalities in a smart city. Further how improvement could
   take place by having a car free city environment, autonomous vehicles
   and shared resource capacity among providers.
   Research limitations/implications - The research relied on a Markov
   model and the numerical solution of its steady state probabilities
   vector to illustrate the transformation of transport operations
   management (OM) in the future city context. More in depth analysis and
   more discrete modelling are clearly needed to assist in the
   implementation of big data initiatives and facilitate new innovations in
   OM. The work complements and extends that of Setia and Patel (2013), who
   theoretically link together information system design to operation
   absorptive capacity capabilities.
   Practical implications - The study implies that transport operations
   would actually need to be re-organized so as to deal with lowering CO2
   footprint. The logistic aspects could be seen as a move from individual
   firms optimizing their own transportation supply to a shared
   collaborative load and resourced system. Such ideas are radical changes
   driven by, or leading to more decentralized rather than having
   centralized transport solutions (Caplice, 2013).
   Social implications - The growth of cities and urban areas in the
   twenty-first century has put more pressure on resources and conditions
   of urban life. This paper is an initial first step in building theory,
   knowledge and critical understanding of the social implications being
   posed by the growth in cities and the role that big data and smart
   cities could play in developing a resilient and sustainable transport
   city system.
   Originality/value - Despite the importance of OM to big data
   implementation, for both practitioners and researchers, we have yet to
   see a systematic analysis of its implementation and its absorptive
   capacity contribution to building capabilities, at either city system or
   organizational levels. As such the Markov model makes a preliminary
   contribution to the literature integrating big data capabilities with OM
   capabilities and the resulting improvements in system absorptive
   capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Economic and social factors, including existing trends in urban
   population and employment growth combined with urbanization, have led to
   enhanced consumption and thus, increasing freight flows in the cities.
   Mitigation of transport impacts has led to plans towards a more
   sustainable urban environment. However, managerial and regulatory
   barriers restrict the incorporation of technological instruments and
   solutions to the sustainable dimension of decision-making and planning.
   This paper has sought to bridge this gap by organizing an educational
   and training program, which involves the participation of todays and
   tomorrow's researchers, decision-makers and practitioners. Towards this
   direction, a methodology is developed that identifies existing gaps
   between the transport industry and the existing research, education and
   training programs and converts identified requirements and gaps into
   training courses. The paper addresses the context of intermodal
   interconnections for the case of Latvia and the region for stimulating
   and strengthening its scientific and technological capacity by providing
   knowledge in the field of smart interconnecting sustainable transport
   networks. The 2-level gap analysis that was developed and implemented
   with respect to the thematic areas of (1) `Governance and policy
   development', (2) `Smart solutions', and (3) `Decision-making', and the
   validation process that followed, has revealed several requirements that
   exist currently for passenger and freight interchanges and educational
   programs for Latvia and the region. Based on the identified educational
   requirements for Latvia and the region, 20 educational areas were
   created that resulted in 12 courses for passenger and freight transport
   interchanges that are going to be used for training and education in
   Latvia.}},

Abstract = {{Retrofitting stormwater systems with sensors and controllers will allow
   cities to be operated as real-time, distributed treatment plants. Unlike
   static infrastructure, which cannot adapt its operation to individual
   storms or changing land uses, ``smart{''} stormwater systems will use
   system-level coordination to maximize watershed pollutant removal and
   treatment. We illustrate that this vision is not limited by technology,
   which has matured to the point at which it can be ubiquitously deployed.
   Rather, the challenge is much more fundamental and rooted in a
   system-level understanding of environmental science. Once distributed
   stormwater systems become highly instrumented and controlled, how should
   they be operated to achieve desired watershed outcomes? The answer to
   this question demands the development of a theoretical framework for
   smart stormwater systems. In this paper, we lay out the requirements for
   such a theory. Acknowledging that the adoption of these systems may
   still be years away, we also present a modeling framework to allow for
   the simulation of controlled stormwater systems before they become
   commonplace. We apply this control framework to two simulated case
   studies in which stormwater sites are controlled to reduce nitrate loads
   to downstream water bodies.}},

Title = {{The ad format-strategy effect on comparative advertising effectiveness}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{99-122}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Extant research on comparative advertising has focused only on
   ``market leader{''} comparisons (a brand targeting the market leader),
   whereas in the marketplace, ``multi-brand{''} comparisons are more
   prevalent (Kalro et al., 2010). Moreover, most research focuses on
   direct comparisons only. Hence, this research aims to investigate the
   interplay between comparison ad strategy ({''}market
   leader{''}/{''}multi-brand{''} comparisons) and comparison ad format
   (direct/indirect comparisons) on the effectiveness of comparative
   advertising.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses four 2 x 2 fully crossed
   factorial designs (comparison ad format: direct vs indirect and
   comparison ad strategy: market leader vs multi brand) with established
   and new brands in two categories: powdered detergents and smart phones.
   All studies were conducted in metropolitan cities of India.
   Findings - By and large, the experiments indicated that direct
   (indirect) comparisons lowered (heightened) perceived manipulative
   intent and enhanced (reduced) attitude-toward-the-ad for multi-brand
   (market leader) comparisons.
   Practical implications - Findings suggest that when advertisers use
   comparative advertising, they may use direct ads when using multi-brand
   comparisons and use indirect ones when using market leader comparisons.
   It could also be argued that when advertisers use multi-brand
   comparisons because of fragmentation in the marketplace, they may
   directly compare against these multiple brands. When advertisers need to
   compare against a market leader, they may do so indirectly.
   Originality/value - This research is among the first to investigate
   multi-brand comparisons that are widely used in the industry and that
   too in the context of both direct and indirect comparison formats.}},

Abstract = {{Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is an important source
   of information about us and others, as well as about local and world
   events. Cities are the largest contributor to energy consumption and
   climate change. Driven by rapid rural migrant influx, Europe's
   unprecedented urbanization is testament to the symbiotic relationship
   that exists between cities. For the first time in human history more
   people live in cities than in rural areas. ICT is changing the
   traditional urban planning model and compelling planners to not only
   consider the physical planning of a city but also to consider the use of
   ICT to make the economy, environment, mobility and governance of a city
   more efficient and effective. In accord urban development faces the
   challenges in combining competiveness and sustainability. Thus, a large
   number of cities confront significant energy, environmental and
   climate-related challenges. Also, urbanization leads to a growing demand
   for sustainable solutions, stable energy, fresh and potable water,
   efficient transportation, and resource management. In order to solve
   these requirements, cities need to be more energy-efficient,
   consumer-focused and technology driven. Most attention in sustainable
   urban development has been directed to three sectors: a) buildings, b)
   energy, and c) mobility.
   Today, however, it is becoming evident that a fourth, equally important
   element must be addressed: information and communications technologies
   (ICT). Accordingly, cities that seek to improve their environmental
   effectiveness have merged sustainability and Information Communication
   Technologies (ICT) in the context of connected societies, global
   competitiveness, economic development, climate change, and demographic
   shifts. This leads to the assumption that a city has to be digitally
   smart, socially intelligent and ecologically sustainable. This study
   deals with the presentation of a model that is based on culture,
   community and decision support systems and presents the eco, digital and
   social city model.}},

Abstract = {{Massive MTC over cellular networks is expected to be an integral part of
   wireless smart city applications. The LTE/LTE-A technology is a major
   candidate for provisioning of MTC applications. However, due to the
   diverse characteristics of payload size, transmission periodicity, power
   efficiency, and QoS requirement, MTC poses huge challenges to LTE/LTE-A
   technologies. In particular, efficient management of massive random
   access is one of the most critical challenges. In the case of massive
   random access attempts, the probability of preamble collision
   drastically increases, and thus the performance of LTE/LTE-A random
   access degrades sharply. In this context, this article reviews the
   current state-of-the-art proposals to control massive random access of
   MTC devices in LTE/LTE-A networks. The proposals are compared in terms
   of five major metrics: access delay, access success rate, power
   efficiency, QoS guarantee, and the effect on HTC. To this end, we
   propose a novel collision resolution random access model for massive MTC
   over LTE/LTE-A. Our proposed model basically resolves the preamble
   collisions instead of avoidance and targets the management of massive
   and bursty access attempts. Simulations of our proposed model show huge
   improvements in random access success rate compared to the standard
   slotted-Aloha- based models. The new model can also coexist with
   existing LTE/LTE-A MAC protocol and ensure high reliability and
   time-efficient network access.}},

Abstract = {{Among multiple services delivered over future mobile networks, the most

   presents a new solution for HTTP-compliant adaptive media streaming
   applicable to future 5G mobile networks, aimed at increasing bandwidth
   availability through the use of multiple radio access technologies and
   direct connections between devices if they are in proximity of each

   high-quality media stream is received by multipath transmission through
   the radio access network. Collaboration of neighboring devices is
   exploited by using direct device-to-device links. Thus, proxy nodes can
   be inserted between a given media receiver and an access network. Toward
   ensuring optimized resource allocation at both levels, base

Abstract = {{This study aims to find out the determinant factors affecting fruit
   consumption behaviour in Portuguese young people, based on the Health
   Action Process Approach (HAPA) model, and determine if this model
   explains differences according to gender, age and rural/urban
   environments. This research is innovative because it tests the HAPA
   model with young people, and because it adds social support to the HAPA
   model as an extra predictor of young people's behaviour. To gather the
   data, a questionnaire survey was applied in two public schools, one in a
   rural area and the other in a city. The survey was answered by 266
   Portuguese young people, aged 15-21 years, from the 10th to the 12th
   grades. Authorization for the survey was given in advance, from the
   Ministry of Education, schools and parents, after which the survey was
   performed. Before applying the questionnaire, two pre-tests were carried
   out, each with ten participants and with similar characteristics to the
   population studied. This study analyses action self-efficacy, outcome
   expectancies, action planning, risk perception, intention, maintenance
   self-efficacy and social support variables. The result was obtained
   through a two-step process, by determining the measurement and
   structural model, using Smart PLS 2.0. The results show that young
   females have more factors determining fruit consumption, with greater
   social support for action self-efficacy, greater maintenance
   self-efficacy through action self-efficacy, and greater perception of
   risk regarding fruit consumption. In terms of age, young people over 16
   years present greater outcome expectations for the intention, greater
   perception of risk and action self-efficacy for fruit consumption. The
   multi-group analysis referring to differences between young people
   living in rural or urban environments did not show proof of the model
   giving a better explanation of one situation or the other. It can be
   concluded that the HAPA model is appropriate to the investigation of
   behaviour factors that influence young people's fruit consumption. The
   results also indicate that in the scope of the behaviour analysed the
   proposed model gives a better explanation for females and for those over
   16 years.}},

Abstract = {{Smart city represents one of the most promising, prominent and
   challenging Internet of Things (IoT) applications {[}1]. In the last few
   years, indeed, the smart city concept has played an important role in
   academic and industry fields, with the development and deployment of
   various middleware platforms and IoT-based infrastructures. However,
   this expansion has followed distinct approaches creating, therefore, a
   fragmented scenario, in which different IoT ecosystems are not able to
   communicate between them. To fill this gap, there is a need to re-visit
   the smart city IoT semantic and to offer a global common approach. To
   this purpose, this paper browses the semantic annotation of the sensors
   in Cloud, and innovative services can be implemented and considered by
   bridging Cloud of Things (CoT) and IoT. Things like semantic will be
   considered to perform the aggregation of heterogeneous resources by
   defining the CoT paradigm. We survey the smart city vision, providing
   information on the main requirements and highlighting the benefits of
   integrating different IoT ecosystems within Cloud under this new CoT
   vision. This paper also discusses relevant challenges in this research

   detailed dataset explaination for each Canadian city (e.g., Calgary,
   Halifax, Surrey, Waterloo, Ottawa, Vancouver, and Toronto), including
   the different data catalogues and their detailed characteristics. Next,
   we discuss the state-of-the-art of the tools and applications developed

Abstract = {{Resource usage estimation for managing streaming workload in emerging
   applications domains such as enterprise computing, smart cities, remote
   healthcare, and astronomy, has emerged as a challenging research
   problem. Such resource estimation for processing continuous queries over
   streaming data is challenging due to: (i) uncertain stream arrival
   patterns, (ii) need to process different mixes of queries, and (iii)
   varying resource consumption. Existing techniques approximate resource
   usage for a query as a single point value which may not be sufficient
   because it is neither expressive enough nor does it capture the
   aforementioned nature of streaming workload. In this paper, we present a
   novel approach of using mixture density networks to estimate the whole
   spectrum of resource usage as probability density functions. We have
   evaluated our technique using the linear road benchmark and TPC-H in
   both private and public clouds. The efficiency and applicability of the
   proposed approach is demonstrated via two novel applications: i)
   predictable auto-scaling policy setting which highlights the potential
   of distribution prediction in consistent definition of cloud elasticity
   rules; and ii) a distribution based admission controller which is able
   to efficiently admit or reject incoming queries based on probabilistic
   service level agreements compliance goals.}},

Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{In the past few years, the Smart Cities concept has become one of the
   main driving forces for the urban transition towards a low carbon
   environment, sustainable economy, and mobility. Tourism, as one of the
   fastest growing industries, is also an important generator of carbon
   emissions; therefore, the recently emerging sustainable tourism concept
   is envisioned as an important part of the Smart Cities paradigm. Within
   this context, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) concept is the key
   technological point for the development of smart urban environments
   through the use of aggregated data, integrated in a single decisional
   platform. This paper performs the first analysis on the feasibility of
   the use of an IoT approach and proposes a specific architecture for a
   sustainable tourism application. The architecture is tailored for the
   optimisation of the movement of cruise ship tourists in the city of
   Cagliari (Italy), by taking into consideration factors such as transport
   information and queue waiting times. A first set of simulations is
   performed using 67-point of interest, real transportation data, and an

Abstract = {{A main challenge for the design and building of green and smart cities

   investigates the usefulness of urban district sustainability evaluation
   systems in informing and guiding urban redevelopment projects. The
   German DGNB Urban District (DGNB UD) sustainability assessment and

   comprehensive method to evaluate eight awarded projects from the

   organized for Seoul's downtown redevelopment. The results have been
   compared with the sustainability assessment of the district status quo
   and the competition call text, noticing a generic enhancement of
   sustainability. However, sustainability categories and criteria were not
   addressed sufficiently by any project in order to meet the integrated
   and holistic certification requirements of DGNB UD. The findings from
   this research emphasize the need for integrated assessment and
   measurements of urban sustainability, beyond projects' self-promotion
   emphasizing greening or single sustainability facets. The research
   findings particularly exemplify how awarded project proposals might
   still be stuck in a specific, limited framework of sustainability. This

Abstract = {{This research explores the opportunity to use standards as recommender
   instruments for designing urban policy. Standards are soft regulatory
   mechanisms that can be used for monitoring and safeguarding. More
   precisely, we explore the potential use of social standards for
   centering the focus of the smart cities initiative back to the citizens,
   and establishing a citizen-centered approach. This is in contrast to the
   industrial drive and technological emphasis which currently dominates.
   Accordingly, we present a set of novel citizenship indicators which
   serve as the basis for the social standardization of smart cities,
   something which is not now taking place, in order to ensure and
   safeguard the basic social urban rights of citizens. The juridical basis
   and well-established points of reference for building indicators for
   citizens' rights in the city are two International Charters. These are
   the European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City,
   and the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City. In this
   paper, we start by comparing and analyzing the rights contained in each
   of the two Charters, and elaborating indicators for measuring the
   promotion and protection of these rights. The elaboration of indicators
   has been based on different criteria and under the common premise of
   universal existence of feeding data, which is the most recurrent problem
   when building indicators meant to be global. Next, at the request of the
   International Standards Organization (ISO), we select the most relevant
   socio-cultural indicators for the Global Charter Agenda, which will be
   introduced in the on-going revision of the smart cities and communities
   standard ISO 37120:2014 Sustainable development of
   communities-Indicators for city services and quality of life. This will
   make ISO 37120 a more beneficial social standard for monitoring and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a recently introduced problem specifically
   designed for Smart Cities and City Logistics applications: the
   multi-path travelling salesman problem with stochastic travel costs
   (mpTSP(s)). The mpTSPs is a variant of the TSP problem where a set of
   paths exists between any two nodes and each path is characterized by a
   random travel time. We propose a two-stage stochastic programming
   formulation where tour design makes up the first stage, while recourse
   decisions related to the choice of the path to follow are made in the
   second stage. To solve this formulation, we propose a heuristic method
   inspired by the Progressive Hedging (PH) algorithm of Rockafellar \&
   Wets (1991, Scenarios and policy aggregation in optimization under
   uncertainty. Math. Oper. Res., 16, 119-147.) We then benchmark the
   solution method by solving model instances derived from the traffic
   speed sensor network of the city of Turin. Furthermore, the impact of
   the stochastic travel time costs on the problem solution is examined,
   showing the benefits of the proposed methodology in both solution
   quality and computational effort when compared to solving the
   deterministic equivalent formulation using a commercial solver.}},

Abstract = {{The management of dynamic and complex urban systems can no longer be
   driven by the sustainability aim alone and the concept of New Public
   Management is not more sufficient in conditions of financial

   general aim of the paper is to bring different concepts together to
   propose a new approach to investment decision making in urban
   development in order to support cities on both strategic and operational
   level. The rationalisation of investment decisions in the management of
   urban development requires acceptance of a new paradigm combining ideas
   of sustainable development and smart city, triad of creativity

   The rationalisation requires also application of multi-criteria analysis

   the subsequent methodological research and also managerial applications
   relating urban development projects. It can be then useful for public
   managers and provide support for decision making. The innovative
   approach of the research is not based on inventing new ideas from the

Abstract = {{The advance of technologies in several areas has allowed the development

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is a distributed system of physical objects
   that requires the seamless integration of hardware (e.g., sensors,
   actuators, electronics) and network communications in order to collect
   and exchange data. IoT smart objects need to be somehow identified to
   determine the origin of the data and to automatically detect the
   elements around us. One of the best positioned technologies to perform
   identification is RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), which in the
   last years has gained a lot of popularity in applications like access
   control, payment cards or logistics. Despite its popularity, RFID
   security has not been properly handled in numerous applications. To
   foster security in such applications, this article includes three main
   contributions. First, in order to establish the basics, a detailed
   review of the most common flaws found in RFID-based IoT systems is
   provided, including the latest attacks described in the literature.
   Second, a novel methodology that eases the detection and mitigation of
   such flaws is presented. Third, the latest RFID security tools are
   analyzed and the methodology proposed is applied through one of them
   (Proxmark 3) to validate it. Thus, the methodology is tested in
   different scenarios where tags are commonly used for identification. In
   such systems it was possible to clone transponders, extract information,
   and even emulate both tags and readers. Therefore, it is shown that the
   methodology proposed is useful for auditing security and reverse
   engineering RFID communications in IoT applications. It must be noted
   that, although this paper is aimed at fostering RFID communications
   security in IoT applications, the methodology can be applied to any RFID
   communications protocol.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main priorities of smart cities is improving the quality of
   life of their inhabitants. Traffic noise is one of the pollutant sources
   that causes a negative impact on the quality of life of citizens, which
   is gaining attention among authorities. The European Commission has
   promoted the Environmental Noise Directive 2002/49/EC (END) to inform
   citizens and to prevent the harmful effects of noise exposure. The
   measure of acoustic levels using noise maps is a strategic issue in the
   END action plan. Noise maps are typically calculated by computing the
   average noise during one year and updated every five years. Hence, the
   implementation of dynamic noise mapping systems could lead to short-term
   plan actions, besides helping to better understand the evolution of
   noise levels along time. Recently, some projects have started the
   monitoring of noise levels in urban areas by means of acoustic sensor
   networks settled in strategic locations across the city, while others
   have taken advantage of collaborative citizen sensing mobile
   applications. In this paper, we describe the design of an acoustic
   low-cost sensor network installed on public buses to measure the traffic
   noise in the city in real time. Moreover, the challenges that a
   ubiquitous bus acoustic measurement system entails are enumerated and
   discussed. Specifically, the analysis takes into account the feature
   extraction of the audio signal, the identification and separation of the
   road traffic noise from urban traffic noise, the hardware platform to
   measure and process the acoustic signal, the connectivity between the
   several nodes of the acoustic sensor network to store the data and,
   finally, the noise maps' generation process. The implementation and
   evaluation of the proposal in a real-life scenario is left for future
   work.}},

Abstract = {{Cultural relics represent national or even global resources of
   inestimable value. How to efficiently manage and preserve these cultural
   relics is a vitally important issue. To achieve this goal, this study
   proposed, designed, and implemented an RFID and Sensor Web-enabled smart

   photovoltaic subtle energy-powered Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
   is used for long-range contactless identification and lifecycle
   management of cultural relics during their storage and circulation. In
   addition, different types of ambient sensors are integrated with the
   RFID tags and deployed around cultural relics to monitor their
   environmental parameters, helping to ensure that they remain in good
   condition. An Android-based smart mobile application, as middleware, is
   used in collaboration with RFID readers to collect information and
   provide convenient management for the circulation of cultural relics.
   Moreover, multiple sensing techniques are taken advantage of
   simultaneously for preservation of cultural relics. The proposed system
   was successfully applied to a museum in the Yongding District, Fujian

Abstract = {{We introduce mobile agents for mobile crowdsensing. Crowdsensing
   campaigns are designed through different roles that are implemented as
   mobile agents. The role-based tasks of mobile agents include collecting
   data, analyzing data and sharing data in the campaign. Mobile agents
   execute and control the campaign autonomously as a multi-agent system
   and migrate in the opportunistic network of participants' devices.
   Mobile agents take into account the available resources in the devices
   and match participants' privacy requirements to the campaign
   requirements. Sharing of task results in real-time facilitates
   cooperation towards the campaign goal while maintaining a selected
   global measure, such as energy efficiency. We discuss current challenges
   in crowdsensing and propose mobile agent based solutions for campaign
   execution and monitoring, addressing data collection and
   participant-related issues. We present a software framework for mobile
   agents-based crowdsensing that is seamlessly integrated into the Web. A
   set of simulations are conducted to compare mobile agent-based campaigns
   with existing crowdsensing approaches. We implemented and evaluated a
   small-scale real-world mobile agent based campaign for pedestrian flock
   detection. The simulation and evaluation results show that mobile agent
   based campaigns produce comparable results with less energy consumption

Abstract = {{Bicycle sharing systems are eco-friendly transportation systems that
   have found wide application in Smart urban environments. Monitoring and
   analyzing the occupancy levels of the system's stations is crucial for
   guaranteeing the quality of the offered service. Advanced data mining
   solutions tailored to bicycle sharing data analysis are needed to
   support system managers to react to critical situations (e.g., lack of
   parked bicycles at a station) that can yield service disruption. This
   paper presents STation Occupancy Predictor (STOP), a data mining
   framework to predicting the occupancy levels (i.e., critical or
   non-critical) of the stations in the near future through Bayesian and
   associative classifiers. The prediction is made based on the current and
   past station occupancy values and on the temporal information associated
   with the predicted time instant. A classification model per station is
   generated on the collected data to support domain experts in
   understanding the underlying events. The model allows predicting
   short-term station occupancy levels and characterizing system usage to
   support planning maintenance activities in the medium term as well. As a

   Geospatial Data: A Case Study of Public Security Video Surveillance}},
Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{With the widespread deployment of ground, air and space sensor sources
   (internet of things or IoT, social networks, sensor networks), the
   integrated applications of real-time geospatial data from ubiquitous
   sensors, especially in public security and smart city domains, are
   becoming challenging issues. The traditional geographic information
   system (GIS) mostly manages time-discretized geospatial data by means of
   the Structured Query Language (SQL) database management system (DBMS)
   and emphasizes query and retrieval of massive historical geospatial data
   on disk. This limits its capability for on-the-fly access of real-time
   geospatial data for online analysis in real time. This paper proposes a
   hybrid database organization and management approach with SQL relational
   databases (RDB) and not only SQL (NoSQL) databases (including the main
   memory database, MMDB, and distributed files system, DFS). This hybrid
   approach makes full use of the advantages of NoSQL and SQL DBMS for the
   real-time access of input data and structured on-the-fly analysis
   results which can meet the requirements of increased spatio-temporal big
   data linking analysis. The MMDB facilitates real-time access of the
   latest input data such as the sensor web and IoT, and supports the
   real-time query for online geospatial analysis. The RDB stores change
   information such as multi-modal features and abnormal events extracted
   from real-time input data. The DFS on disk manages the massive
   geospatial data, and the extensible storage architecture and distributed
   scheduling of a NoSQL database satisfy the performance requirements of
   incremental storage and multi-user concurrent access. A case study of
   geographic video (GeoVideo) surveillance of public security is presented
   to prove the feasibility of this hybrid organization and management
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are emerging as an eco-friendly and
   cost-effective alternative to conventional vehicles driven by internal
   combustion engines. However, uncoordinated charging of a large number of
   PEVs may cause grid failure. Therefore, charge scheduling of PEVs is an
   important problem. However, the charge scheduling by a single aggregator
   does not scale well as the PEV population grows. We propose a
   distributed framework for efficient PEV charging with multiple
   aggregators in a city where a PEV raises its charging request to a
   specific aggregator, and each aggregator has partial information about
   others. The aggregators collaborate among themselves for scheduling PEVs
   for charging in different charging stations owned by it or others. In
   this paper, we formulate a bi-objective charge scheduling optimization
   problem that attempts to maximize the total profit of the aggregators
   while maximizing the total number of PEVs charged. We first prove that
   the problem is NP-complete. We then propose distributed offline and
   online algorithms to solve the problem, and present simulation results

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{81-96}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Bus arrival time is usually estimated using the boarding time of the
   first passenger at each station. However, boarding time data are not
   recorded in certain double-ticket smart card systems. As many passengers
   usually swipe the card much before their alighting, the first or the
   average alighting time cannot represent the actual bus arrival time,
   either. This lack of data creates difficulties in correcting bus arrival
   times. This paper focused on developing a model to calculate bus arrival
   time that combined the alighting swiping time from smart card data with
   the actual bus arrival time by the manual survey data. The model was
   built on the basis of the frequency distribution and the regression
   analysis. The swiping time distribution, the occupancy and the seating
   capacity were considered as the key factors in creating a method to
   calculate bus arrival times. With 1011 groups of smart card data and 360
   corresponding records from a manual survey of bus arrival times, the
   research data were divided into two parts stochastically, a training set
   and a test set. The training set was used for the parameter
   determination, and the test set was used to verify the model's
   precision. Furthermore, the regularity of the time differences between
   the bus arrival times and the card swiping times was analyzed using the
   ``trend line{''} of the last swiping time distribution. Results from the
   test set achieved mean and standard error rate deviations of 0.6\% and
   3.8\%, respectively. The proposed model established in this study can
   improve bus arrival time calculations and potentially support state
   prediction and service level evaluations for bus operations. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Introduction: The origins of obesity are complex and multifaceted. To be
   successful, an intervention aiming to prevent or treat obesity may need
   to address multiple layers of biological, social, and environmental
   influences.
   Methods: NIH recognizes the importance of identifying effective
   strategies to combat obesity, particularly in high-risk and
   disadvantaged populations with heightened susceptibility to obesity and
   subsequent metabolic sequelae. To move this work forward, the National
   Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, in collaboration with the NIH Office
   of Behavioral and Social Science Research and NIH Office of Disease
   Prevention convened a working group to inform research on multilevel
   obesity interventions in vulnerable populations. The working group
   reviewed relevant aspects of intervention planning, recruitment,
   retention, implementation, evaluation, and analysis, and then made
   recommendations.
   Results: Recruitment and retention techniques used in multilevel
   research must be culturally appropriate and suited to both individuals
   and organizations. Adequate time and resources for preliminary work are
   essential. Collaborative projects can benefit from complementary areas
   of expertise and shared investigations rigorously pretesting specific
   aspects of approaches. Study designs need to accommodate the social and
   environmental levels under study, and include appropriate attention
   given to statistical power. Projects should monitor implementation in
   the multiple venues and include a priori estimation of the magnitude of
   change expected within and across levels.
   Conclusions: The complexity and challenges of delivering interventions
   at several levels of the social - ecologic model require careful
   planning and implementation, but hold promise for successful reduction
   of obesity in vulnerable populations. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Pushed by the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm modern sensor networks
   monitor a wide range of phenomena, in areas such as environmental
   monitoring, health care, industrial processes, and smart cities. These
   networks provide a continuous pulse of the almost infinite activities
   that are happening in the physical space and are thus, key enablers for
   a Digital Earth Nervous System. Nevertheless, the rapid processing of
   these sensor data streams still continues to challenge traditional
   data-handling solutions and new approaches are being requested. We
   propose a generic answer to this challenge, which has the potential to
   support any form of distributed real-time analysis. This neutral
   methodology follows a brokering approach to work with different kinds of
   data sources and uses web-based standards to achieve interoperability.
   As a proof of concept, we implemented the methodology to detect
   anomalies in real-time and applied it to the area of environmental
   monitoring. The developed system is capable of detecting anomalies,
   generating notifications, and displaying the recent situation to the
   user.}},

Abstract = {{There is an ongoing enormous expansion of Internet of Things devices and
   services in everyday life, notably in novel large scale urban
   environments called Smart Cities. There, availability and uses of
   Internet of Things by end users and businesses is mainly palpable
   subject to prior knowledge of the relevant providers and use of
   dedicated applications that are associated with them. This current
   reality can be largely ascribed to the property of ``verticality{''} of
   autonomous Internet of Things eco-systems in Smart Cities, where
   Internet of Things devices (e.g. sensor nodes) are connected over a
   communication infrastructure to service-cloud platforms that deliver and
   process data that is then presented at the applications level. This
   paper explains possibilities for revolutionary changes needed towards
   liberalising deployment and visibility of IoT services and data
   associated with them. It advocates a conceptual approach termed
   ``horizontal networking for Internet of Things{''} facilitating a more
   open and generic presence of Internet of Things through the proposed
   Internet of Things identification meta-data. The vision is built on
   needed novel practical features in the current communication setups. The

Abstract = {{Recently, a rapid growth in the population in urban regions demands the
   provision of services and infrastructure. These needs can be come up wit
   the use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as sensors, actuators,
   smartphones and smart systems. This leans to building Smart City towards
   the next generation Super City planning. However, as thousands of IoT
   devices are interconnecting and communicating with each other over the
   Internet to establish smart systems, a huge amount of data, termed as
   Big Data, is being generated. It is a challenging task to integrate IoT
   services and to process Big Data in an efficient way when aimed at
   decision making for future Super City. Therefore, to meet such
   requirements, this paper presents an IoT-based system for next
   generation Super City planning using Big Data Analytics. Authors have
   proposed a complete system that includes various types of IoT-based
   smart systems like smart home, vehicular networking, weather and water
   system, smart parking, and surveillance objects, etc., for dada
   generation. An architecture is proposed that includes four tiers/layers
   i.e., 1) Bottom Tier-1, 2) Intermediate Tier-1, 3) Intermediate Tier 2,
   and 4) Top Tier that handle data generation and collections,
   communication, data administration and processing, and data
   interpretation, respectively. The system implementation model is
   presented from the generation and collection of data to the decision
   making. The proposed system is implemented using Hadoop ecosystem with
   MapReduce programming. The throughput and processing time results show
   that the proposed Super City planning system is more efficient and

   analytics applications (based on machine learning algorithms) and

   the relationship between learning algorithms, neuroscience, and the new
   learning spaces of the city by combining the notion of programmable
   `code/space' with ideas about the `social life of the brain' to suggest
   that new kinds of `brain/code/spaces' are being developed where the

   learning and `human qualities' of cognition performed by algorithmic

   data analytics and cognitive computing in the smart city are being
   translated into the neuropedagogic brain/code/spaces of the school, with
   significant consequences for how learners are to be addressed and acted

Abstract = {{Emerging applications in automation, medical imaging, traffic monitoring
   and surveillance need real-time data transmission over Wireless Sensor
   Networks (WSNs). Guaranteeing Quality of Service (QoS) for real-time
   traffic over WSNs creates new challenges. Rapid penetration of smart
   devices, standardization of Machine Type Communications (MTC) in next
   generation 5G wireless networks have added new dimensions in these
   challenges. In order to satisfy such precise QoS constraints, in this
   paper, we propose a new cross-layer QoS-provisioning strategy in
   Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs). The network layer performs
   statistical estimation of sensory QoS parameters. Identifying
   QoS-routing problem with multiple objectives as NP-complete, it
   discovers near-optimal QoS-routes by using evolutionary genetic
   algorithms. Subsequently, the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer
   classifies the packets, automatically adapts the contention window,
   based on QoS requirements and transmits the data by using routing
   information obtained by the network layer. Performance analysis is
   carried out to get an estimate of the overall system. Through the
   simulation results, it is manifested that the proposed strategy is able
   to achieve better throughput and significant lower delay, at the expense
   of negligible energy consumption, in comparison to existing WMSN QoS

Abstract = {{Software-enabled technologies and urban big data have become essential
   to the functioning of cities. Consequently, urban operational governance
   and city services are becoming highly responsive to a form of
   data-driven urbanism that is the key mode of production for smart
   cities. At the heart of data-driven urbanism is a computational
   understanding of city systems that reduces urban life to logic and
   calculative rules and procedures, which is underpinned by an
   instrumental rationality and realist epistemology. This rationality and
   epistemology are informed by and sustains urban science and urban
   informatics, which seek to make cities more knowable and controllable.
   This paper examines the forms, practices and ethics of smart cities and
   urban science, paying particular attention to: instrumental rationality
   and realist epistemology; privacy, datafication, dataveillance and
   geosurveillance; and data uses, such as social sorting and anticipatory
   governance. It argues that smart city initiatives and urban science need
   to be re-cast in three ways: a re-orientation in how cities are
   conceived; a reconfiguring of the underlying epistemology to openly
   recognize the contingent and relational nature of urban systems,
   processes and science; and the adoption of ethical principles designed
   to realize benefits of smart cities and urban science while reducing
   pernicious effects.

Abstract = {{Mobile crowdsensing is a burgeoning concept that allows smart cities to

   incentive mechanisms for mobile crowdsensing and proposes the concept of
   SPECTRUM as a guide for inferring the most appropriate type of incentive
   suited to any given crowdsensing task. Furthermore, the paper highlights
   research challenges and areas where additional studies related to the
   different factors outlined in the concept of SPECTRUM are needed to
   improve citizen participation in mobile crowdsensing. It is envisaged
   that the broad range of factors covered in SPECTRUM will enable smart
   cities to efficiently engage citizens in large-scale crowdsensing
   initiatives. More importantly, the paper is expected to trigger
   empirical investigations into how various factors as outlined in
   SPECTRUM can influence the type of incentive mechanism that is
   considered most appropriate for any given mobile crowdsensing
   initiative.}},

   Usage}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Bike-sharing programs, with initiatives to increase bike use and improve
   accessibility of urban transit, have received increasing attention in
   growing number of cities across the world. The latest generation of
   bike-sharing systems has employed smart card technology that produces
   station-based data or trip-level data. This facilitates the studies of
   the practical use of these systems. However, few studies have paid
   attention to the changes in users and system usage over the years, as
   well as the impact of system expansion on its usage. Monitoring the
   changes of system usage over years enables the identification of system
   performance and can serve as an input for improving the
   location-allocation of stations. The objective of this study is to
   explore the impact of the expansion of a bicycle-sharing system on the
   usage of the system. This was conducted for a bicycle-sharing system in
   Zhongshan (China), using operational usage data of different years
   following system expansion. To this end, we performed statistical and
   spatial analyses to examine the changes in both users and system usage
   between before and after the system expansion. The findings show that
   there is a big variation in users and aggregate usage following the
   system expansion. However, the trend in spatial distribution of demand
   shows no substantial difference over the years, i.e. the same
   high-demand and low-demand areas appear. There are decreases in demand
   for some old stations over the years, which can be attributed to either
   the negative performance of the system or the competition of nearby new
   stations. Expanding the system not only extends the original users'
   ability to reach new areas but also attracts new users to use
   bike-sharing systems. In the conclusions, we present and discuss the
   findings, and offer recommendations for the further expansion of system.}},

Abstract = {{By the year 2050, more than 70\% of the world's population will be
   living in cities. The rush to the cities, along with subsequent
   increased consumption patterns, has dire consequences, for the
   ecological systems that sustain human life. Some find hope in the
   potential that cities can be built differently, that green
   infrastructure and denser forms of development will satisfy human needs
   while decreasing the stress on valuable resources and mitigating
   consequences of climate change. Some say that ``strong political
   leadership and robust governance{''} is critical for this need to drive
   sustainable urban transitions. However, are ``political will{''} and
   ``good governance{''} enough or is the issue more complicated than this?
   Using a critical political economy approach this paper shows the
   fundamental difficulties that arise when attempting to transition urban
   centres to ``smarter{''}, more ``sustainable{''} and ``resilient{''}
   cities. Ultimately, the paper argues that ``good governance{''} and

Abstract = {{The growth in pervasive network infrastructure called the Internet of

   interpretation of these evolving large data is required for timely
   detection of interesting events. This article develops and exemplifies
   two new relatives of the visual assessment of tendency (VAT) and
   improved visual assessment of tendency (iVAT) models, which uses cluster
   heat maps to visualize structure in static datasets. One new model is
   initialized with a static VAT/iVAT image, and then incrementally (hence
   inc-VAT/inc-iVAT) updates the current minimal spanning tree (MST) used
   by VAT with an efficient edge insertion scheme. Similarly,
   dec-VAT/dec-iVAT efficiently removes a node from the current VAT MST. A
   sequence of inc-iVAT/dec-iVAT images can be used for (visual) anomaly
   detection in evolving data streams and for sliding window based cluster
   assessment for time series data. The method is illustrated with four

Abstract = {{With the growing popularity of information and communications
   technologies and information sharing and integration, cities are
   evolving into large interconnected ecosystems by using smart objects and
   sensors that enable interaction with the physical world. However, it is
   often difficult to perform real-time analysis of large amount on
   heterogeneous data and sensory information that are provided by various
   resources. This paper describes a framework for real-time semantic
   annotation and aggregation of data streams to support dynamic
   integration into the Web using the advanced message queuing protocol. We
   provide a comprehensive analysis on the effect of adaptive and
   nonadaptive window size in segmentation of time series using SensorSAX
   and symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) approaches for data streams
   with different variation and sampling rate in real-time processing. The
   framework is evaluated with three parameters, namely window size
   parameter of the SAX algorithm, sensitivity level, and minimum window
   size parameters of the SensorSAX algorithm based on the average data
   aggregation and annotation time, CPU consumption, data size, and data
   reconstruction rate. Based on a statistical analysis, a detailed
   comparison between various sensor points is made to investigate the
   memory and computational cost of the stream-processing framework. Our
   results suggests that regardless of utilized segmentation approach, due

Abstract = {{Many researches show that the power consumption of network devices of
   ICT is nearly 10\% of total global consumption. While the redundant
   deployment of network equipment makes the network utilization is
   relatively low, which leads to a very low energy efficiency of networks.
   With the dynamic and high quality demands of users, how to improve
   network energy efficiency becomes a focus under the premise of ensuring
   network performance and customer service quality. For this reason, we
   propose an energy consumption model based on link loads, and use the
   network's bit energy consumption parameter to measure the network energy
   efficiency. This paper is to minimize the network's bit energy
   consumption parameter, and then we propose the energy-efficient minimum
   criticality routing algorithm, which includes energy efficiency routing
   and load balancing. To further improve network energy efficiency, this
   paper proposes an energy-efficient multi-constraint rerouting (E2MR2)
   algorithm. E2MR2 uses the energy consumption model to set up the link
   weight for maximum energy efficiency and exploits rerouting strategy to
   ensure network QoS and maximum delay constraints. The simulation uses

Abstract = {{The Urban Geological Map of Catalonia Project focuses on the geological
   characterisation of county capitals and towns with a population larger
   than 10 000. This represents 131 municipalities hosting similar to 6.2
   million inhabitants and a study area of 2200 km(2). To address the
   underground geological structure and properties of the geological units
   it has been established a set of 3D modelling methods, which are based
   on: (i) Comparing digital terrain models from different ages to
   determine elevation changes produced on the last century; (ii)
   delineating contour lines at 5 metre intervals and seriated
   crosssections taking into account borehole data, geomorphological
   features, detailed geological mapping and H/V measures; (iii)
   compartmentalisation of geological horizons in sectors where bedding
   orientation is approximately constantly separated by lines of locally
   sharp curvature; (iv) interpolation of multiple 2D sections and contour
   lines after a detailed structural analysis of the data; and (v) creating
   regular grids of regional planar geological structures derived from the
   interpolation of field measurements of the dip and the dip direction.
   These methods pay special attention to the structure of the near
   surface, the part of the underground, which most directly influences the
   urban environment. 3D reconstructions depend on available information
   and the geological, geomorphological and anthropogenic features of each
   study area. The comparison of multi-temporal digital terrain models is
   especially useful to define the geometry of certain artificial deposits.
   The main Quaternary and Neogene surfaces are primarily reconstructed by
   contour lines. The reconstruction of the Palaeogene and Mesozoic
   horizons are built from the integration of contour lines, cross-section
   traces and hinge lines related to dip domains. The reconstruction
   procedure for the main Palaeozoic horizons and the faults is usually
   based on interpolating master cross-sections and contour lines.
   Presently, the role of 3D modelling in the Urban Geological Map of
   Catalonia Project is oriented to derivate different components of the 1:
   5000 scale geological map sheets, such as the pre-Quaternary basement
   map, the cross-sections, and the isopach map of the drift deposits. To
   improve the development and the sustainability of the Catalan cities, we
   advocate that, in the coming years, we must strive in the integration of
   the 3D geological models in their urban planning systems. The
   combination of the different 3D geological modelling techniques
   presented in this work represents a methodological sound basis to
   reconstruct the subsurface of these urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of the Internet of Things (IoT) on the evolution toward next
   generation smart environments (e.g., smart homes, buildings, and cities)
   will largely depend on the efficient integration of IoT and cloud
   computing technologies. With the predicted explosion in the number of
   connected devices and IoT services, current centralized cloud
   architectures, which tend to consolidate computing and storage resources
   into a few large data centers, will inevitably lead to excessive network
   load, end-to-end service latencies, and overall power consumption.
   Thanks to recent advances in network virtualization and programmability,
   highly distributed cloud networking architectures are a promising
   solution to efficiently host, manage, and optimize next generation IoT
   services in smart environments. In this paper, we mathematically
   formulate the service distribution problem (SDP) in IoT-Cloud networks,
   referred to as the IoT-CSDP, as a minimum cost mixed-cast flow problem
   that can be efficiently solved via linear programming. We focus on
   energy consumption as the major driver of today's network and cloud
   operational costs and characterize the heterogeneous set of IoT-Cloud
   network resources according to their associated sensing, computing, and
   transport capacity and energy efficiency. Our results show that, when
   properly optimized, the flexibility of IoT-Cloud networks can be
   efficiently exploited to deliver a wide range of IoT services in the

Abstract = {{Today's emerging trends like factory of the future, big data,
   Internet-of-things, intelligent traffic solutions, cyber-physical
   systems, wireless sensor networks, smart home, smart city and smart grid
   raise new challenges on software development. They are characterized by
   high concurrency, distribution and dynamics as well as huge numbers of
   heterogeneous devices, resources and users that must collaborate in a
   reliable way. The management of the interactions and dependencies
   between the participants is a complex task posing massive coordination
   problems. The here proposed approach is twofold: (i) to analyze
   similarities in the communication and synchronization behavior of such
   applications and to identify coordination patterns; and (ii) to give a
   precise specification of them by means of a suitable coordination model
   which enables the development of coordination pattern-based software
   components as solutions. The vision is to compose advanced cooperative
   information systems from proven, configurable, reusable, generic
   components that run on a suitable target platform, in order to reduce
   software development time, risks and costs. In this paper we delimit the
   idea of ``coordination patterns{''} from other related pattern
   approaches and motivate the need for a well-defined model to specify
   them. Several coordination models to achieve this goal are discussed,
   and the advantages of a new coordination model termed the ``Peer
   Model{''} are pointed out. The feasibility of the approach to identify
   coordination patterns, to model them and to provide generic components
   that can be reused in different scenarios through configuration and
   composition is evaluated by means of a coordination pattern found in
   several industrial use cases.}},

Title = {{Extraction and Simplification of Building Facade Pieces from Mobile
   Laser Scanner Point Clouds for 3D Street View Services}},
Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Extraction and analysis of building facades are key processes in the
   three-dimensional (3D) building reconstruction and realistic geometrical
   modeling of the urban environment, which includes many applications,
   such as smart city management, autonomous navigation through the urban
   environment, fly-through rendering, 3D street view, virtual tourism,
   urban mission planning, etc. This paper proposes a building facade
   pieces extraction and simplification algorithm based on morphological
   filtering with point clouds obtained by a mobile laser scanner (MLS).
   First, this study presents a point cloud projection algorithm with
   high-accuracy orientation parameters from the position and orientation
   system (POS) of MLS that can convert large volumes of point cloud data
   to a raster image. Second, this study proposes a feature extraction
   approach based on morphological filtering with point cloud projection
   that can obtain building facade features in an image space. Third, this
   study designs an inverse transformation of point cloud projection to
   convert building facade features from an image space to a 3D space. A
   building facade feature with restricted facade plane detection algorithm
   is implemented to reconstruct facade pieces for street view service. The
   results of building facade extraction experiments with large volumes of
   point cloud from MLS show that the proposed approach is suitable for
   various types of building facade extraction. The geometric accuracy of
   building facades is 0.66 m in x direction, 0.64 in y direction and 0.55
   m in the vertical direction, which is the same level as the space
   resolution (0.5 m) of the point cloud.}},

Abstract = {{Outdoor irrigation water conservation in the commercial sector has

   such as installing soil moisture sensors (SMCs), installing smart
   irrigation controllers (SICs) for their businesses, and participating in
   voluntary landscape irrigation assessments (LIA). We conducted a mail

Abstract = {{This paper highlights three critical aspects of the internet of things

   associated with the best possible RF source in order to maximize the
   overall energy that the IoT devices harvest. For energy balancing, the
   IoT devices in close proximity are clustered together and then an IoT
   device with the highest residual energy is selected as a cluster head
   (CH) on a rotational basis. Once the CH is selected, it assigns channels
   to the IoT devices to report their data using a novel integer linear

Title = {{Enabling SDN in VANETs: What is the Impact on Security?}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The demand for safe and secure journeys over roads and highways has been
   growing at a tremendous pace over recent decades. At the same time, the
   smart city paradigm has emerged to improve citizens' quality of life by
   developing the smart mobility concept. Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks
   (VANETs) are widely recognized to be instrumental in realizing such
   concept, by enabling appealing safety and infotainment services. Such
   networks come with their own set of challenges, which range from
   managing high node mobility to securing data and user privacy. The
   Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm has been identified as a
   suitable solution for dealing with the dynamic network environment, the
   increased number of connected devices, and the heterogeneity of
   applications. While some preliminary investigations have been already
   conducted to check the applicability of the SDN paradigm to VANETs, and
   its presumed benefits for managing resources and mobility, it is still
   unclear what impact SDN will have on security and privacy. Security is a
   relevant issue in VANETs, because of the impact that threats can have on
   drivers' behavior and quality of life. This paper opens a discussion on
   the security threats that future SDN-enabled VANETs will have to face,
   and investigates how SDN could be beneficial in building new
   countermeasures. The analysis is conducted in real use cases (smart
   parking, smart grid of electric vehicles, platooning, and emergency
   services), which are expected to be among the vehicular applications
   that will most benefit from introducing an SDN architecture.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) technology, a variety

   service discovery and matching approach for a service combination
   process, which calculates the semantic similarity between services, and
   a heuristic algorithm to search the service candidates for a specific

Abstract = {{Smart cities have given a significant impetus to manage traffic and use
   transport networks in an intelligent way. For the above reason,
   intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and location-based services
   (LBSs) have become an interesting research area over the last years. Due
   to the rapid increase of data volume within the transportation domain,
   cloud environment is of paramount importance for storing, accessing,
   handling, and processing such huge amounts of data. A large part of data
   within the transportation domain is produced in the form of Global
   Positioning System (GPS) data. Such a kind of data is usually infrequent
   and noisy and achieving the quality of real-time transport applications
   based on GPS is a difficult task. The map-matching process, which is
   responsible for the accurate alignment of observed GPS positions onto a
   road network, plays a pivotal role in many ITS applications. Regarding
   accuracy, the performance of a map-matching strategy is based on the
   shortest path between two consecutive observed GPS positions. On the
   other extreme, processing shortest path queries (SPQs) incurs high
   computational cost. Current map-matching techniques are approached with
   a fixed number of parameters, i.e., the number of candidate points (N
   (CP)) and error circle radius (ECR), which may lead to uncertainty when
   identifying road segments and either low-accurate results or a large
   number of SPQs. Moreover, due to the sampling error, GPS data with a
   high-sampling period (i.e., less than 10 s) typically contains
   extraneous datum, which also incurs an extra number of SPQs. Due to the
   high computation cost incurred by SPQs, current map-matching strategies
   are not suitable for real-time processing. In this paper, we propose
   real-time map-matching (called RT-MM), which is a fully adaptive
   map-matching strategy based on cloud to address the key challenge of
   SPQs in a map-matching process for real-time GPS trajectories. The
   evaluation of our approach against state-of-the-art approaches is
   performed through simulations based on both synthetic and real-world
   datasets.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper critically reflects on the building of the Dublin Dashboard -
   a website built by two of the authors that provides citizens, planners,
   policy makers and companies with an extensive set of data and
   interactive visualizations about Dublin City, including real-time
   information - from the perspective of critical data studies. The
   analysis draws upon participant observation, ethnography, and an archive
   of correspondence to unpack the building of the dashboard and the
   emergent politics of data and design. Our findings reveal four main
   observations. First, a dashboard is a complex socio-technical assemblage
   of actors and actants that work materially and discursively within a set
   of social and economic constraints, existing technologies and systems,
   and power geometries to assemble, produce and maintain the website.
   Second, the production and maintenance of a dashboard unfolds
   contextually, contingently and relationally through transduction. Third,
   the praxis and politics of creating a dashboard has wider recursive
   effects: just as building the dashboard was shaped by the wider
   institutional landscape, producing the system inflected that landscape.
   Fourth, the data, configuration, tools, and modes of presentation of a
   dashboard produce a particularised set of spatial knowledges about the
   city. We conclude that rather than frame dashboard development in purely
   technical terms, it is important to openly recognize their contested and
   negotiated politics and praxis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Smart transportation plays an important role in building smart cities.
   We can obtain mass data from multi-source and use it to manage
   transportation in an intelligent way. Images and videos can be easily
   obtained from various sensors in modern road system. They offer abundant
   information about the transportation. Therefore, visual analysis is a
   key point in smart transportation management. In this paper we propose a
   robust visual object tracking algorithm using adaptive local appearance
   model, which can be applied to transportation system. As the main
   challenge of tracking is to adapt to the target's appearance change, we
   build the model with a local patch dictionary which is composed of a
   static part and an online updated part. The updating scheme is important
   to determine the quality of tracking results. We propose a coefficient
   quality based on sparse representation as the sign of updating and
   introduce incremental learning to compute the new information to update
   the dictionary. This strategy adapts the templates to appearance change

Abstract = {{Smart transportation has a significantly impact on city management and
   city planning, which has received extensive attentions from academic and
   industrial communities. Different from omni-directional sensing system,
   as a directional sensing system, the multimedia-directional sensor
   network holds the special coverage scheme, which is usually used for
   smart cities, smart transportation, and harsh environment surveillance,
   for instance, nuclear-pollution regions where are inhospitable for
   people. This paper advances Virtual Stream Artificial Fish-swarm based
   Coverage-Enhancing Algorithm (VSAFCEA) as a coverage-enhancing means in
   multimedia directional sensor networks. Firstly, a concept of virtual
   streams, based on traditional artificial fish-swarm algorithm, is
   proposed. Then, the traditional behaviors of fishes in artificial
   fish-swarm algorithm are modified and expanded with several new
   behaviors. Finally, the presented VSAFCEA is adopted for
   coverage-enhancing issue in the situation of directional sensor networks
   with rotational direction-adjustable model. With a sequence of steps of
   artificial fishes in virtual stream, the presented VSAFCEA can figure
   out the approximation to the highest area coverage rate. Based on
   comparison of these simulation results (results of presented VSAFCEA and
   that of other typical coverage-enhancing ways in directional sensor
   networks), the conclusion can be drawn that VSAFCEA could attain higher
   area coverage rate of directional sensor networks with fewer iterative
   computing times.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Vehicles searching for a vacant parking spot on the street can amount to
   as much as 40 \% of the traffic in certain city areas, thus largely
   affecting mobility in urban environments. For this reason, it would be
   desirable to create integrated smart traffic management systems capable
   of providing real-time information to drivers about the location of
   available vacant parking spots. A scalable solution would consist in
   exploiting the existing and widely-deployed video surveillance camera
   networks, which requires the development of computer vision algorithms
   for detecting vacant parking spots. Following this idea, this work
   introduces QuickSpot, a car-driven video analytics solution for
   on-street vacant parking spot detection designed as a motion detection,
   object tracking and visual recognition pipeline. One of the main
   features of QuickSpot is its simplified setup, as it can be trained on
   external databases to learn the appearances of the objects it is capable
   of recognizing (pedestrians and vehicles). To test its performance under
   different daytime lighting conditions, we have recorded, edited,
   annotated and made available to the research community the QuickSpotDB
   video database for the vacant parking spot detection problem. In the
   conducted experiments, we have evaluated the trade-off between the
   accuracy and the computational complexity of QuickSpot with an eye to
   its practical applicability. The results show that QuickSpot detects
   parking spot status with an average accuracy close to 99 \% at a
   1-second rate regardless of the illumination conditions, outperforming
   in an indirect comparison the other car-driven approaches reported in
   the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless multihop infrastructures (WMIs) facilitate low-cost and quick
   deployable network infrastructures for emerging applications in
   emergency responses and smart cities. Cooperative sharing of energy
   consumption is essential for network sustainability. This paper studies
   the problem of cooperative sharing of routing services in an emergency
   WMI (E-WMI) by examining the regulation of route switching from
   perspectives of network-wide and long-time energy efficiency. A key idea
   in the regulation of route switching is employing explicit routing terms
   among base stations in an E-WMI, allowing tolerance of temporary
   imbalance of energy consumption in the network. A routing term refers to
   a period for a base station to continuously serve routing in an E-WMI.
   By taking into account the specific features of E-WMIs, this paper
   overcomes the challenging problems of complexity and difficulty in
   examining the explicit route switching and energy distribution in
   multihop networks. We find that there exists the optimal routing term
   and number of route switching for the long-time energy efficiency. With
   the optimal routing terms, a network can take a principle of distributed
   energy sharing by route switching management rather than only applying
   end-to-end energy-efficient routing that does not have a long-time
   management of network energy consumption.}},

   unobtrusively collected from 10 residential and commercial buildings
   located in Skellefte (a) over circle, Sweden. The load forecast models
   are generated using supervised machine learning techniques, namely,
   support vector machine, regression tree, feed forward neural network,
   and multiple linear regression. The model takes the outdoor temperature,
   historical values of heat load, time factor variables and physical
   parameters of district heating substations as its input. A performance
   comparison among the machine learning methods and identification of the
   importance of models input variables is carried out. The models are
   evaluated with varying forecast horizons of every hour from 1 up to 48

Abstract = {{Traffic is one of the main sources of particulate matter (PM) inside
   urban, areas. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the
   potential to reduce outdoor PM concentrations by local removal inside
   semi enclosed parking garages. The assessment is performed by
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on the 3D steady RAMS equations
   and an Eulerian advection-diffusion equation. First, an extensive CFD
   validation study is performed with gas dispersion wind-tunnel
   measurements. Next, the case study for Eindhoven city center is
   conducted on a high-resolution grid including 16 semi-enclosed garages.
   Traffic intensities on the streets and in the garages are converted to
   PM10 source terms. The garages are ventilated with outdoor air.
   Simulations are performed with and without removal units in the garages.
   The case study is not intended to reproduce a particular pollution
   episode but to provide a preliminary indication of the potential
   reduction in PM10 for representative meteorological and traffic
   conditions. The results show that 594 removal units allow reductions in
   local outdoor PM10 by up to 50\% close to the garages while reductions
   up to 10\% are achieved further downstream. It is concluded that local
   removal in semi-enclosed parking garages can be an effective strategy

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Management measures for peak-load shifting are employed to alleviate
   power shortages during the peak hours in some countries with
   power-supply shortages, such as China. One of the most popular measures
   is to rank the electricity users with respect to their relative
   importance in the society. In ranking the sequence, the decision maker
   may encounter difficulties because the types of data employed for this
   purpose are not consistent. Thus, a ranking method capable of handling
   different types of data is necessary and presented in this paper. To
   prioritize electricity users in a reasonable manner, an evaluation
   system for the purpose of peak-load shifting is established from three
   aspects: economic, social, and environmental impacts. Then a mixed-data
   dominance method is employed in this work to determine the comprehensive
   closeness degree of each user under each index, and an optimal
   comprehensive weight model is then presented with both the subjective
   weights and objective weights. Based on the attained optimal
   comprehensive weight and the comprehensive closeness degree, the
   weighted closeness degree of each electricity user can be calculated and
   the final ranking result for all electricity users obtained. The

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of modern society has been a double-edged sword; it has
   led to positive results such as income growth due to the diversification
   of our society, but also negative results such as an increase in crime.
   For this reason, cities are confronting a wide range of issues. Social
   issues, especially criminal offenses, stir up more fear of crime among
   residents. The rapid societal penetration of digital devices such as
   smart phones, along with an increase in IT knowledge, has made our lives
   more convenient. However, cyber-crime and violent crime taking advantage
   of these benefits are also increasing. There is an increasing need for
   crime prevention and crime prediction in order to solve these problems,
   and many studies on crime are under way as part of our effort to respond
   to various changes in our society using a variety of prediction tools.
   Thus, in this study, a combined risk probability map generation model
   was suggested by predicting crime frequency through a Markov Chain
   Analysis, quantifying risks through objective classification of urban
   spaces and applying attribute-specific risk indexes and interpretation
   keys across the entire scope of the study. The crime prediction model
   based on risk probability map suggested in this study facilitates
   multimedia services using mobile devices such as smartphones and thus
   can be used to optimally plan patrol routes of police officers in zones
   vulnerable to crimes as well as placement of surveillance systems, which
   will in turn contribute to relieving many citizens' anxiety about crime.
   Our model's approach is too small environment in this research time. But
   we will try to more experiment environment is big such as town and state

Abstract = {{The concept of Smart Cities and the monitoring of environmental
   parameters is an area of research that has attracted scientific
   attention during the last decade. These environmental parameters are
   well-known as important factors in their affection towards people.
   Massive monitoring of this kind of parameters in cities is an expensive
   and complex task. Recent technologies of low-cost computing and
   low-power devices have opened researchers to a wide and more accessible
   research field, developing monitoring devices for deploying Wireless
   Sensor Networks. Gathering information from them, improved urban plans
   could be carried out and the information could help citizens. In this
   work, the prototyping of a low-cost acoustic sensor based on the
   Raspberry Pi platform for its use in the analysis of the sound field is
   described. The device is also connected to the cloud to share results in
   real time. The computation resources of the Raspberry Pi allow treating
   high quality audio for calculating acoustic parameters. A pilot test was
   carried out with the installation of two acoustic devices in the
   refurbishment works of a neighbourhood. In this deployment, the
   evaluation of these devices through long-term measurements was carried
   out, obtaining several acoustic parameters in real time for its
   broadcasting and study. This test has shown the Raspberry Pi as a
   powerful and affordable computing core of a low-cost device, but also
   the pilot test has served as a query tool for the inhabitants of the
   neighbourhood to be more aware about the noise in their own place of

   Finally, we develop a max-confidence based method to detect travel

Abstract = {{`Smart cities' embrace technologically based solutions as an enabler of

   `green' undoubtedly is a large innovation engine, yet not the only one.
   Similarly, the beneficial impacts of `green' technology solutions are
   yet to be fully understood or rigorously established. Cities that
   adopted smart roadmaps embedded lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions

Abstract = {{Research on Smart Cities has come of age. Intense discussion on this

   smart urban policies has been attempted. This article aims at filling
   this gap. By building on a solid definition of Smart Cities, the article
   tests the empirical relationship between urban smartness and the
   intensity of Smart City policies. A novel data set on four different
   types of policies and smart urban characteristics is assembled for 314
   European Union cities. Empirical results suggest that Smart City
   policies are more likely to be designed and implemented in cities that
   are already endowed with smart characteristics. Our findings also point
   to a higher probability that Smart City policies are implemented in
   denser and wealthier urban areas. These empirical results call for
   further research on the real effects of actual implemented Smart City

Abstract = {{Smart cities (SCs) are a recent but emerging phenomenon, aiming at using
   high technology and especially information and communications technology
   (ICT) to implement better living conditions in large metropolises, to
   involve citizens in city government, and to support sustainable economic
   development and city attractiveness. The final goal is to improve the
   quality of city life for all stakeholders. Until now, SCs have been
   developing as bottom-up projects, bringing together smart initiatives
   driven by public bodies, enterprises, citizens, and not-for-profit
   organizations. However, to build a long-term smart strategy capable of
   producing better returns from investments and deciding priorities
   regarding each city, a comprehensive SC governance framework is needed.
   The aim of this paper is to collect empirical evidences regarding
   government structures implemented in SCs and to outline a framework for
   the roles of local governments, nongovernmental agencies, and
   administrative officials. The survey shows that no consolidated
   standards or best practices for governing SCs are implemented in the
   examined cities; however, each city applies its own governance
   framework. Moreover, the study reveals some interesting experiences that
   may be useful for involving citizens and civil society in SC governance.}},

   prototyping an understanding of the possibilities of technology in city
   services of the future. Results from these sessions show that
   participating stakeholders indeed gained a new perspective upon issues
   facing the city, due to an increased awareness and understanding of, and

Abstract = {{Most of the definitions of a smart city make a direct or indirect
   reference to improving performance as one of the main objectives of
   initiatives to make cities smarter. Several evaluation approaches and
   models have been put forward in literature and practice to measure smart
   cities. However, they are often normative or limited to certain aspects
   of cities' smartness, and a more comprehensive and holistic approach
   seems to be lacking. Thus, building on a review of the literature and
   practice in the field, this paper aims to discuss the importance of
   adopting a holistic approach to the assessment of smart city governance
   and policy decision making. It also proposes a performance assessment
   framework that overcomes the limitations of existing approaches and
   contributes to filling the current gap in the knowledge base in this
   domain. One of the innovative elements of the proposed framework is its
   holistic approach to policy evaluation. It is designed to address a
   smart city's specificities and can benefit from the active participation
   of citizens in assessing the public value of policy decisions and their
   sustainability over time. We focus our attention on the performance
   measurement of codesign and coproduction by stakeholders and social
   innovation processes related to public value generation. More
   specifically, we are interested in the assessment of both the citizen
   centricity of smart city decision making and the processes by which
   public decisions are implemented, monitored, and evaluated as regards
   their capability to develop truly blended value servicesthat is,
   simultaneously socially inclusive, environmentally friendly, and

Abstract = {{Citizens' engagement is considered as one of the important dimensions
   for the development of smart cities since, in the vision of a city of
   the future (smart city), citizens will be more and more involved in the
   decision-making process of different issues related to the development
   of a city. In this context, policy makers face a decision problem where
   they have to integrate a new dimension, which is the voice of the
   citizens' decision. This article proposes a tool based on multicriteria
   decision making methods to provide decision makers with the best
   alternative(s) that are based on citizens' opinions. In order to tackle
   the potential interdependencies between criteria and also between
   alternatives in the selection process, we apply a hybrid model
   integrating the analytical network process and an extended version of
   technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution to
   support group decision-making. The proposed model is applied in the
   context of participatory budgeting (PB) where citizens decide on the
   projects in which the money can be invested. This process is complex
   since it encompasses multiple interdependent criteria that may be
   conflicting with each other and that are used to take decisions. To
   illustrate our approach, we will apply the proposed technique for the
   case study of La Marsa, a city in the north of the capital Tunis
   (Tunisia) that adopted, since 2014, a PB strategy in which citizens
   proposed alternatives on how an amount of money can be used to lighten
   specific streets in the city.}},

Abstract = {{In coastal cities, population and property are concentrated in small
   areas, with abundant resources and convenient transportation, but also
   with potential tsunami risk, as shown by the tsunami disasters of 2004,
   2010 in Indonesia. Coastal area citizens need to evacuate to a safe
   place as soon as tsunamis occur. The prime evacuation time is very
   critical for them, but it is delayed in practice by complex information
   transfer processes. In recent years, spatial information has become an
   important resource used in dynamic decision support for emergencies, and
   smart phones have become a primary social communication device during
   interactions in emergencies. This paper outlines the design and
   development of a prototype geographical information system centric,
   social media based dynamic decision support system (GIS-SM-DDSS) that
   integrates geographical information with Twitter technology to enable
   self organized information networks to support decision making and
   collective actions in emergency situations. The actors include
   government policy makers, policy managers, highly influential social
   leaders in local communities, and policy executors and urban citizens
   impacted by disasters. The main system functions include dynamic
   disaster risk analysis, timely dissemination of evacuation strategies to
   community residents, and real-time detection of environmental risk and
   evacuation support. This system is designed as a field experiment in
   Padang, Indonesia, to help public officials design tsunami risk maps
   with timely evacuation routes and transmit these maps to influential
   leaders in local neighborhoods that are exposed to tsunami risk. Each
   neighborhood leader would then tweet the detailed route to citizens that
   follow the tweet. The proposed has potential to support evacuation
   strategies and real-time guidance of communities at risk during

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become ubiquitous, e.g., in
   logistics, smart manufacturing, smart city infrastructures or vehicular
   ad-hoc networks. WSNs tend to rely on ad-hoc infrastructures that are
   prone to a wide range of different defects, e.g., communication
   failures, faulty sensors or nodes that have been tampered with.
   Additionally, dealing with defects is challenging, as defects might
   occur only occasionally. In this paper, we introduce SEDEL, our approach
   for Sensor nEtwork DEfect Localization. SEDEL helps the WSN operator to
   pinpoint defective nodes in the routing topology of a WSN. In
   particular, we let the operator store graph representations of the
   routing topology, together with information if the WSN has produced
   errors. Based on this information, SEDEL assigns each WSN node a
   suspiciousness score that is correlated with the defect probability.
   Thus, our approach can be used with any kind of defect, and the kind
   does not have to be known, as long as the operator can decide if a
   certain processing is correct or not. We have evaluated SEDEL with a
   real sensor-node deployment. Our evaluation shows that the defective
   node is assigned a high probability in the vast majority of the
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware routing (CAR) approach
   that uses the cloud as an extra level of data-request processing to
   improve the network performance in terms of data delivery. Data delivery
   in the Internet of Things depends heavily on numerous factors, such as
   the amount of data, end-to-end in-network delay, and setup time. The CAR
   approach is significantly improving the current request-response model,
   especially while the exchanged in-network data amount increases and data
   are sent from source to destination in a peer-to-peer fashion. What we
   are trying to show in this paper, in particular, is the benefits of
   having a central context-aware server (in the cloud) in improving the
   end-user experience. Hence, the proposed CAR approach is a typical
   candidate for data-intensive cloud-based applications. It considers
   source and destination requirements in terms of data size, delay, link
   capacity, and available applications on the operating devices as well.
   Extensive simulations are performed, and achieved results show the
   efficiency of our approach against other competitive approaches in terms
   of in-network delay and packet delivery ratio.}},

Title = {{DCBRP: a deterministic chain-based routing protocol for wireless sensor
   networks}},
Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a promising area for
   both researchers and industry because of their various applications The
   sensor node expends the majority of its energy on communication with
   other nodes. Therefore, the routing protocol plays an important role in
   delivering network data while minimizing energy consumption as much as
   possible. The chain-based routing approach is superior to other
   approaches. However, chain-based routing protocols still expend
   substantial energy in the Chain Head (CH) node. In addition, these
   protocols also have the bottleneck issues.
   Methods: A novel routing protocol which is Deterministic Chain-Based
   Routing Protocol (DCBRP). DCBRP consists of three mechanisms: Backbone
   Construction Mechanism, Chain Head Selection (CHS), and the Next Hop
   Connection Mechanism. The CHS mechanism is presented in detail, and it
   is evaluated through comparison with the CCM and TSCP using an ns-3
   simulator.
   Results: It show that DCBRP outperforms both CCM and TSCP in terms of
   end-to-end delay by 19.3 and 65\%, respectively, CH energy consumption
   by 18.3 and 23.0\%, respectively, overall energy consumption by 23.7 and
   31.4\%, respectively, network lifetime by 22 and 38\%, respectively, and
   the energy{*} delay metric by 44.85 and 77.54\%, respectively.
   Conclusion: DCBRP can be used in any deterministic node deployment
   applications, such as smart cities or smart agriculture, to reduce
   energy depletion and prolong the lifetimes of WSNs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents lessons learnt through empirical research work
   developed in three metropolitan cities in South Italy aimed at exploring
   if and how the Smart framework might improve urban planning in cities
   with lacks in planning processes. Authors argue that organized networks
   of citizens (such as non-profit organizations or private associations)
   together with networks of institutions (such as partnerships amongst
   municipalities or universities) are needed in order to improve the
   smartness of a city; technologies are framed as opportunities and
   supports for more inclusive and informed decision-making processes, i.e.
   as a tool, rather than as a goal, for effective smartness. The paper
   discusses the primary findings of a Research Project conducted at the
   Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering
   (DICEA), University of Naples, titled Smart Energy Master for the Energy
   Management of Territory funded by EU.
   The methodology is based on the case-study method, whose sources of
   evidence are: quantitative indicators, archival documents, and excerpts
   from interviews with key stakeholders. In detail, the paper focuses on
   three Southern Italian cities (Reggio Calabria, Catania and Palermo),
   which have been clustered for similar challenges they have to face, in
   relation to their geographical proximity and cultural features. Findings
   show the twofold use of technologies for cities: on the one hand,
   technology may be perceived as a panacea and Smart initiatives may be
   isolated and episodic experiments; on the other, technologies may be
   critically incorporated in complex policies and initiatives aimed at
   regenerating urban areas holistically, and Smart initiatives may be
   coordinated and well-connected experiences. Authors argue that the
   second cases are feasible approaches for improving urban planning in
   challenging South-European contexts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The introduction in 2007 of a new public transport system in Santiago,
   Chile, brought to us an unexpected gift: the availability of Big Data;
   massive amounts of passive data obtained from technological devices
   installed to control the operation of buses and to administer the fare
   collection process. Many other cities in the world have experienced the
   same, and sooner or later, this is likely to happen everywhere. Seeing
   this opportunity, many researchers have developed tools to obtain
   valuable information from the available data. However, the case of
   Transantiago is particularly advantageous because all buses have GPS
   devices and the smart card presents an overall 97\% penetration rate.
   We describe a successful experience of collaboration between academia
   and the public transport authority to develop tools based on passive
   data processing. We include a brief description of the Transantiago
   system and the agreements made to develop the aforementioned tools. We
   also describe the methods developed to obtain valuable information like
   public transport trips origin-destination matrices, speed profiles of
   buses and service quality indicators, among others. Several examples of
   specific uses of the information for public transport policy and
   planning in Santiago are presented. The paper concludes with a
   discussion of what else can be obtained from this data and why we
   believe that this can change the way we do transport planning. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The study of systems and architectures for ambient assisted living (AAL)
   is undoubtedly a topic of great relevance given the aging of the world
   population. The AAL technologies are designed to meet the needs of the
   aging population in order to maintain their independence as long as
   possible. As people typically spend more than 90\% of their time in
   indoor environments, indoor air quality (iAQ) is perceived as an
   imperative variable to be controlled for the inhabitants' wellbeing and
   comfort. Advances in networking, sensors, and embedded devices have made
   it possible to monitor and provide assistance to people in their homes.
   The continuous technological advancements make it possible to build
   smart objects with great capabilities for sensing and connecting several
   possible advancements in ambient assisted living systems architectures.
   Indoor environments are characterized by several pollutant sources. Most
   of the monitoring frameworks instantly accessible are exceptionally
   costly and only permit the gathering of arbitrary examples. iAQ is an
   indoor air quality system based on an Internet of Things paradigm that
   incorporates in its construction Arduino, ESP8266, and XBee technologies
   for processing and data transmission and micro sensors for data
   acquisition. It also allows access to data collected through web access
   and through a mobile application in real time, and this data can be
   accessed by doctors in order to support medical diagnostics. Five
   smaller scale sensors of natural parameters (air temperature, moistness,
   carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and glow) were utilized. Different
   sensors can be included to check for particular contamination. The
   results reveal that the system can give a viable indoor air quality
   appraisal in order to anticipate technical interventions for improving
   indoor air quality. Indeed indoor air quality might be distinctively
   contrasted with what is normal for a quality living environment.}},

Abstract = {{The world is entering a new era, where Internet-of-Things (IoT), smart
   homes, and smart cities will play an important role in meeting the
   so-called big challenges. In the near future, it is foreseen that the
   majority of the world's population will live their lives in smart homes
   and in smart cities. To deal with these challenges, to support a
   sustainable urban development, and to improve the quality of life for
   citizens, a multi-disciplinary approach is needed. It seems evident,
   however, that a new, advanced Information and Communications Technology
   ICT infrastructure is a key feature to realize the ``smart{''} vision.
   This paper proposes a specific solution in the form of a hierarchical
   layered ICT based infrastructure that handles ICT issues related to the
   ``big challenges{''} and seamlessly integrates IoT, smart homes, and
   smart city structures into one coherent unit. To exemplify benefits of
   this infrastructure, a complex IoT system has been deployed, simulated
   and elaborated. This simulation deals with wastewater energy harvesting
   from smart buildings located in a smart city context. From the
   simulations, it has been found that the proposed infrastructure is able
   to harvest between 50\% and 75\% of the wastewater energy in a smart
   residential building. By letting the smart city infrastructure
   coordinate and control the harvest time and duration, it is possible to
   achieve considerable energy savings in the smart homes, and it is
   possible to reduce the peak -load for district heating plants.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decades, urban growth boundaries (UGBs) have been regarded
   as effective tools applied by planners and local governments to curb
   urban sprawl and guide urban smart growth. The UGBs help limit urban
   development to suitable areas and protect surrounding agricultural and
   ecological landscapes. At present, China's Town and Country Planning Act
   officially requires the delimitation of UGBs in a city master planning
   outline and in central urban area planning. However, China's practices
   in UGBs are usually determined by urban planners and local authorities,
   and lack a sound analytical basis. Consequently, Chinese UGBs are often
   proven to be inefficient for controlling urban expansion. In this paper,
   take the fast-growing Xinzhuang town of Changshu city, eastern China as
   an example, a new method towards establishing UGBs is proposed based on
   land-use change model (the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at
   Small regional extent, CLUE-S). The results of our study show that the
   land-use change and urban growth simulation accuracy of CLUE-S model is
   high. The expansion of construction land and the decrease of paddy field
   would be the main changing trends of local land use, and a good deal of
   cultivated land and ecological land would be transformed into
   construction land in 2009-2027. There is remarkable discordance in the
   spatial distribution between the simulated UGBs based on the CLUE-S
   model and the planned UGBs based on the conventional method, where the
   simulated results may more closely reflect the reality of urban growth
   laws. Therefore, we believe that our method could be a useful planning
   tool for the delimitation of UGBs in Chinese cities.}},

   harvesting tanks were installed intensively and a rainwater harvesting
   house was constructed in the city of Fukuoka, Japan after the city
   experienced a flood disaster. The former enhanced users' daily
   preparedness for emergency, and the latter inspired construction of a
   rainwater harvesting housing complex. A public elementary school is in
   use from April 2016, which is inspired by these facilities. The school
   premises are located on the land reclaimed from an old irrigation pond.
   Thus the school needs to be adapted to this condition. 3000 m(3) of

   way the positions of the sensors. Existing range-based techniques for
   secure positioning require a burdensome infrastructure, with many fixed
   anchors. Reducing the infrastructure would reduce deployment cost and
   foster the adoption of secure positioning solutions in wireless sensor
   networks. In this article, we propose SPEM, a secure positioning system
   based on multilateration and ultra-wideband (UWB) distance bounding
   protocols. The key idea behind SPEM is to leverage the low probability
   that an adversary has of controlling enlargement attacks against UWB. We
   estimate such a probability by a thorough study and signal-level
   simulations of the UWB physical layer. We test SPEM both in a simulated
   environment and in a real indoor environment using real UWB
   transceivers. We show that SPEM needs far less infrastructure than
   state-of-the- art solutions (-22\% to -93\%, depending on the anchor
   deployment method), while achieving high levels of security against
   smart and determined adversaries.}},

Abstract = {{A growing body of literature has emerged that examines cities as key
   sites for socio-technical experimentation with a variety of initiatives
   and interventions to reduce carbon emissions, upgrade ageing
   infrastructure networks and stimulate economic development. Yet while
   there has been a wide survey of global initiatives and attempts to
   explain the wider processes driving such experimentation (Bulkeley and
   Castan Broto, 2013) there remains a lack of empirical case study
   analysis to bring the concepts into context. In this paper we use the
   concept of urban experimentation as a lens to discuss the political and
   social ramifications of one such intervention in a city's energy
   infrastructure network, with an examination of the Pecan Street smart
   grid project in Austin, Texas. The ability for cities to manage
   socio-technical transitions and their inflections by specific locales
   has been largely neglected in social science research, yet cities around
   the world are facing similar problems of ageing infrastructures,
   pressures of resource consumption and demanding shifts towards
   intermittent renewable technologies. We argue that cities are key arenas
   for the trialling, testing and development of smart products that can
   help transition towards a low-carbon economy, however the opening up' of
   cities as experimental nodes is contributing to a restructuring in
   socio-technical urban governance, creating new spaces for private
   investment while delegating responsibilities for carbon control down to
   urban citizens.}},

Abstract = {{To handle the emergence of the regional healthcare ecosystem, physicians
   and surgeons in various departments and healthcare institutions must
   process medical images securely, conveniently, and efficiently, and must
   integrate them with electronic medical records (EMRs). In this
   manuscript, we propose a software as a service (SaaS) cloud called the
   iMAGE cloud.
   A three-layer hybrid cloud was created to provide medical image
   processing services in the smart city of Wuxi, China, in April 2015. In
   the first step, medical images and EMR data were received and integrated
   via the hybrid regional healthcare network. Then, traditional and
   advanced image processing functions were proposed and computed in a
   unified manner in the high-performance cloud units. Finally, the image
   processing results were delivered to regional users using the virtual
   desktop infrastructure (VDI) technology. Security infrastructure was
   also taken into consideration.
   Integrated information query and many advanced medical image processing
   functions-such as coronary extraction, pulmonary reconstruction,
   vascular extraction, intelligent detection of pulmonary nodules, image
   fusion, and 3D printing-were available to local physicians and surgeons
   in various departments and healthcare institutions.
   Implementation results indicate that the iMAGE cloud can provide
   convenient, efficient, compatible, and secure medical image processing
   services in regional healthcare networks. The iMAGE cloud has been
   proven to be valuable in applications in the regional healthcare system,
   and it could have a promising future in the healthcare system worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Recognized as implementation actors of operative measures for transition

Abstract = {{The transportation sector accounts for approximately one-fifth of global
   primary energy use and one quarter of all energy related carbon dioxide
   emissions, with nearly half of those emissions originating from
   passenger vehicles. In order to reduce significantly the use of fossil
   fuels in urban mobility, whilst improving air quality and increasing the
   accessibility and attractiveness of urban areas, it is necessary to
   increase the use of non-conventionally fuelled vehicles for passenger
   and freight transport in urban areas. The introduction of electric
   vehicles (EVs) is a promising option, so as to achieve decarbonisation
   objectives, energy security, improved urban air quality and to increase
   energy efficiency. However, there are a number of challenges for the
   large-scale deployment of EV both on global and European level. These,
   in particular, are the high cost of the battery, lack of a standardised
   recharging infrastructure, relatively low range of battery electric
   vehicles or lack of interesting value proposition for consumers. A few
   studies have attempted to calculate the costs and benefits of EVs, but
   none consider the cost and benefits of EVs at a level of detail
   comparable to what has been performed for other vehicle technologies.
   This study constructs the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of EVs, based on

Abstract = {{Buildings represent about 40\% of the total primary energy consumption

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel cognitive cellular automata (CA) approach to

   provides the advantage of a heterogeneous communication interface based
   on cognitive mechanisms that recognize different transmission modulation
   modes. The receiver gets messages through different transmission
   modulation modes. In this work, we postulate vehicles connecting to
   traffic congestion computing centers by vehicle-to-roadside
   communications within a car society. Roadside units serve each road
   segment, and we suppose that every car has a navigation device. We
   propose an innovative congestion-reduction mechanism that provides
   directions to a vehicle's navigation device after the driver sets the
   origin location and the destination. This mechanism calculates the
   congestion status of the upcoming road segment. By tracking the status
   of road segments from a point of origin to a destination, our proposed

   are still in use in their unique local landscapes. An example of
   successful ecological engineering is the Tuancheng drainage system in
   Beijing. This paper presents a technical analysis of this drainage
   system and describes a hydrological model built in Stella (R) for a
   one-time rainstorm event and for annual water balance analyses. The
   results demonstrate how well the drainage criteria were chosen and prove
   that the implementation was exceptionally successful. An example of
   smart design solutions is the underground circular C-shaped drainage
   system in the terrace, where at each turning point, there is a pit to
   collect rainwater. In addition, the inverted paving by trapezoidal
   bricks and soil improvements contributed to the rapid infiltration of
   rainwater. During intense rainstorms, the system effectively attenuated
   stormwater and increased the infiltration rate. During drought
   conditions, such as in 1965, with only 226 mm of rainfall, the system
   increased soil water retention by 27 mm. The Tuancheng drainage system
   is an excellent example of an engineering solution managing drainage and
   storage, on- and underground, and using gray and green infrastructure to
   create a hydrological landscape functionally equivalent to natural
   conditions. Exploring ancient wisdom and using the ideas of our

Abstract = {{Historically the land development process has lacked a decision support
   structure for evaluating undeveloped parcels of land for compatibility
   with land use policy and engineering constraints. This paper
   demonstrates an applied multi-criteria decision support structure for
   characterizing the spatial distribution and classification of a parcel's
   potential to support residential lot construction. This support
   structure is based on parcel attributes quantified in a typical site
   feasibility report, to include: potential house yield, wetlands area,
   soil types, streams (surface drains), and steep slope areas. The
   analytical capabilities of geographic information system (GIS) are
   employed in the decision support structure named the constructability
   assessment method (CAM). CAM integrates a dynamic multi-criteria
   attribute assessment method, based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process
   (AHP), for a given set of administrative requirements, and engineering
   constraints and judgment.
   The results of a case study using CAM characterized the approximate
   location of ideal lots for homes construction in an R-1 zoning district
   located on a 1290 acre land parcel in Loudoun County, VA, while avoiding
   existing hydric soils, floodplains, steep slopes, and forested areas.
   The number of ideal lots for a given set of engineering and
   administrative constraints represented a 65\% reduction from the maximum
   lots pemiitted by regulatory constraints alone. The methodology used in
   this case study provides a consistent and repeatable land parcel
   analysis technique for undeveloped land parcels, and can be adapted
   and/or extended to a number of similar publicly available geographic
   datasets and constraint. In estimating optimal development density, CAM
   meets the needs of zoning administrators as well as the developers, thus
   offering a demand-driven market-based solution for sustainable land

Abstract = {{A reflective approach is adopted in analyzing the reviews on the impact
   of indoor air quality on humans over the last 30 years (1986-2016). The
   major findings reiterate the concerns of indoor air pollution (IAP) and
   provide a deeper understanding of how contaminants contribute to, and
   interact to accentuate the adverse effects on humans. Issues which have
   emerged and increased in importance are indoor chemistry, airborne
   infection, and the impact on performance. Societal trends of rising
   affluence of the middle class, increased population density in cities,
   introduction of new synthetic materials, reliance on childcare
   facilities have led to greater intensity of exposure to IAP. Responses
   to climate change, energy conservation and singular strategies to manage
   the complex challenge of IAP have not been effective in alleviating the
   deterioration of indoor air quality. Innovations in air distribution,
   air cleaning, modularization of indoor environmental devices/systems,
   and leveraging on smart technologies and sensing systems which
   incorporate algorithms that optimizes indoor air quality with
   conventional performance indicators are important advancements towards a
   holistic solution. User engagement, both as a sensor and indicator of
   preferences, when integrated with such innovations, may usher in the
   next important paradigm towards achieving acceptable indoor
   environmental quality beyond the current definitions of acceptability

Abstract = {{Instrumentation of the urban environment is not by itself sufficient to
   have a meaningful impact on the quality, sustainability, and resilience
   of cities - or more broadly on urban policy and planning. Understanding
   the social, economic, and cultural dynamics of urban life requires both
   an appreciation of the social sciences and a substantive engagement with
   communities across neighborhoods. The Smart City messaging is replete
   with claims of the potential for sensors and information and
   communication technologies (ICT) to re-shape urban life, although such
   rhetoric ignores the practical realities and constraints of urban
   decision-making and the social and distributional concerns of policy
   outcomes. Rather, significant progress could be achieved at the
   neighborhood scale by focusing diverse, intensive, and persistent
   real-time data collection and analysis on a Quantified Community (QC).
   The QCa long-term neighborhood informatics research initiativeis a
   network of instrumented urban neighborhoods that collect, measure, and
   analyze data on physical and environmental conditions and human behavior
   to provide a rich resource to better understand how neighborhoods and
   the built environment affect individual and social well-being. The
   resulting unique experimental environment provides a testing ground for
   new physical and informatics technologies, policies, and behavioral
   interventions, allowing for unprecedented studies in urban planning and
   design, urban systems engineering and management, and the social
   sciences. Focusing on the neighborhood scale also allows for meaningful
   interaction with, and participation by, the people who live, work, and
   play in that space and shifts the emphasis of data-driven design away
   from top-down routinization to a human-centric problem-solving. This
   paper presents the conceptual framework and justification for the QC,
   built on the lessons learned from three initial deployments in New York
   City, and a networked experimental environment of neighborhood labs.}},

   administered to citizens who had been invited to participate but had
   decided not to participate. Examining the four motivational factors of
   Concern, Belief, Technology, and Time through a series of Kruskal-Wallis
   H Tests indicated that respondents had a statistically significant
   favorable attitude toward Intention to Participate if they had some
   concern and belief, and if they had access to technology and available

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel methodology for the spatial downscaling of
   real-world deployments of wireless networks, running protocols, and/or
   applications for the Internet of Things (IoT). These networks are often
   deployed in environments not easily accessible and highly unpredictable,
   where doing experiments is very expensive and time consuming. The latter
   calls for the need to develop downscaled testbeds, deployed in
   controlled environments, where tests can be conducted under predictable
   conditions. This paper presents a methodology to realize the downscaling
   of a real deployment on an experimental platform, called controllable
   testbed that has a much larger number of nodes with respect to the real
   one. The downscaling procedure proposed is based on the identification
   of the most appropriate subset of nodes of the controllable testbed, to
   be used to reproduce the channel gains between each node pair in the
   real world. The latter, in fact, results in obtaining the same network
   topologies, bringing to the same performance on average, when the same
   protocol stack and software are run. After the description of the
   procedure, an example of its implementation is provided. Comparison of
   results, in terms of packet loss rate (PLR), network throughput, and
   topologies achieved on the downscaled testbed and on the real-world
   deployment, is given; results show a very good fit and demonstrate the
   efficacy of the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Urban sprawl, as consequence of human activities, is directly related to
   the global energy consumption. Current urban planning is not a process
   that ensures energy efficient cities. In such a context, this goal
   becomes essential to achieve sustainable development of territory and
   human activities. This paper discusses a theoretical model and its
   practical application which relates energy consumption and solar energy
   supply with urban parameters, challenging the concept of energy
   efficient city. In contrast with the dominant approaches to energy
   efficiency at local scale, the energy efficient city reflects a cellular
   model of self-reliant city based on the redesign of existing urban areas
   and the planning of new urban expansions conducted with the effort to
   reduce electricity use and promote widespread integration of solar
   energy and smart grids. The application of this model aims to improve
   the global energy performance of city making previsions of energy
   consumption patterns and solar energy potential, in new strategic
   expansion areas and exiting ones. In turn, a detailed framework of
   guidelines for urban planning is presented to support the optimization,
   adaptation and development of energy efficient cities. The promotion of
   adequate urban planning practices is a key point to create opportunities
   for both reducing energy consumption and supporting the integration of

Abstract = {{As we delve into the Internet of Things, we are witnessing intensive
   interaction and heterogeneous communication among different devices over
   the Internet. Consequently, these devices generate a massive volume of
   big data. The potential of these data has been analyzed by complex
   network theory, describing a specialized branch, known as ``human
   dynamics.{''} In this extension, the goal is to describe human behavior
   in the social area in real time. These objectives are starting to be
   practicable through the quantity of data provided by smartphones, social
   networks, and smart cities. These make the environment more intelligent
   and offer an intelligent space to sense our activities or actions and
   the evolution of the ecosystem. To address the above-mentioned needs,
   this work presents a new concept of SmartBuddy that focuses on the
   analysis, the ecosystem provided by smart cities, wearable devices
   (e.g., body area network), and big data to determine human behaviors as
   well as human dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The recent advances in cloud services technology are fueling a plethora
   of information technology innovation, including networking, storage, and
   computing. Today, various flavors have evolved of IoT, cloud computing,
   and so-called fog computing, a concept referring to capabilities of edge
   devices and users' clients to compute, store, and exchange data among
   each other and with the cloud. Although the rapid pace of this evolution
   was not easily foreseeable, today each piece of it facilitates and
   enables the deployment of what we commonly refer to as a smart scenario,
   including smart cities, smart transportation, and smart homes. As most
   current cloud, fog, and network services run simultaneously in each
   scenario, we observe that we are at the dawn of what may be the next big
   step in the cloud computing and networking evolution, whereby services
   might be executed at the network edge, both in parallel and in a
   coordinated fashion, as well as supported by the unstoppable technology
   evolution. As edge devices become richer in functionality and smarter,
   embedding capacities such as storage or processing, as well as new
   functionalities, such as decision making, data collection, forwarding,
   and sharing, a real need is emerging for coordinated management of
   fog-to-cloud (F2C) computing systems. This article introduces a layered
   F2C architecture, its benefits and strengths, as well as the arising
   open and research challenges, making the case for the real need for
   their coordinated management. Our architecture, the illustrative use
   case presented, and a comparative performance analysis, albeit
   conceptual, all clearly show the way forward toward a new IoT scenario
   with a set of existing and unforeseen services provided on highly
   distributed and dynamic compute, storage, and networking resources,
   bringing together heterogeneous and commodity edge devices, emerging
   fogs, as well as conventional clouds.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the Smart City has become a very popular concept
   amongst policy makers and urban planners. In a nutshell, the Smart City
   refers to projects and planning strategies that aim to join up new forms
   of inclusive and low-carbon economic growth based on the knowledge
   economy through the deployment of information and communication
   technologies. However, at the same time as new urban Smart interventions
   are being designed and applied, insufficient attention has been paid to
   how these strategies are inserted into the wider political economy and,
   in particular, the political ecology of urban transformation. Therefore,
   in this paper we critically explore the implementation of the Smart
   City, tracing how the environment' and environmental concerns have
   become an organising principle in Barcelona's Smart City strategy.
   Through an urban political ecology prism we aim to critically reflect
   upon the contradictions of the actually existing Smart City in Barcelona
   and how Smart discourses and practices might be intentionally or
   unintentionally mobilised in ways that serve to depoliticise urban
   redevelopment and environmental management. The paper stresses the need
   to repoliticise the debates on the Smart City and put citizens back at

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Rainwater harvesting (RWH) has the potential to reduce water-related
   costs by providing an alternate source of water, in addition to
   relieving pressure on public water sources and reducing stormwater
   runoff. Existing methods for determining the optimal size of the cistern
   component of a RWH system have various drawbacks, such as specificity to
   a particular region, dependence on numerical optimization, and/or
   failure to consider the costs of the system. In this paper a formulation
   is developed for the optimal cistern volume which incorporates the fixed
   and distributed costs of a RWH system while also taking into account the
   random nature of the depth and timing of rainfall, with a focus on RWH
   to supply domestic, nonpotable uses. With rainfall inputs modeled as a
   marked Poisson process, and by comparing the costs associated with
   building a cistern with the costs of externally supplied water, an
   expression for the optimal cistern volume is found which minimizes the
   water-related costs. The volume is a function of the roof area, water
   use rate, climate parameters, and costs of the cistern and of the
   external water source. This analytically tractable expression makes
   clear the dependence of the optimal volume on the input parameters. An
   analysis of the rainfall partitioning also characterizes the efficiency
   of a particular RWH system configuration and its potential for runoff
   reduction. The results are compared to the RWH system at the Duke Smart
   Home in Durham, NC, USA to show how the method could be used in
   practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider real-life smart parking systems where parking lot occupancy
   data are collected from field sensor devices and sent to backend servers
   for further processing and usage for applications. Our objective is to
   make these data useful to end users, such as parking managers, and,
   ultimately, to citizens. To this end, we concoct and validate an
   automated classification algorithm having two objectives: (1) outlier
   detection: to detect sensors with anomalous behavioral patterns, i.e.,
   outliers; and (2) clustering: to group the parking sensors exhibiting
   similar patterns into distinct clusters. We first analyze the statistics
   of real parking data, obtaining suitable simulation models for parking
   traces. We then consider a simple classification algorithm based on the
   empirical complementary distribution function of occupancy times and
   show its limitations. Hence, we design a more sophisticated algorithm
   exploiting unsupervised learning techniques (self-organizing maps).
   These are tuned following a supervised approach using our trace
   generator and are compared against other clustering schemes, namely
   expectation maximization, k-means clustering and DBSCAN, considering six
   months of data from a real sensor deployment. Our approach is found to
   be superior in terms of classification accuracy, while also being

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an urban-decision support system (U-DSS) devoted to
   manage, in a unified framework, the logistic services of the smart
   cities, such as postal delivery (PD) and waste collection (WC) services.
   The U-DSS architecture is proposed by describing its main components. In
   particular, this paper focuses on the core of the U-DSS, i.e., the model
   component that provides the solutions of a general vehicle assignment
   and routing optimization problem with the aim of minimizing the length
   of the routes and satisfying time and capacity constraints. In order to
   solve the vehicle routing problems in reasonable time, a two-phase
   heuristic algorithm is proposed based on a clustering strategy and a
   farthest insertion heuristic for the solution of a traveling salesman
   problem. The applicability of the proposed U-DSS is enlightened by
   comparing the proposed heuristic algorithm solutions with the mixed
   integer linear programming problem solutions of the PD and WC services.
   Moreover, the discussion of the real case studies of the city of Bari
   (Italy) assesses the proposed approach.
   Note to Practitioners-The motivation of this paper is to design an
   urban-decision support system (U-DSS) for use by decision makers (DMs)
   in the offline optimal planning of the vehicle assignment and routing in
   different services, such as postal delivery and waste collection. The
   U-DSS provides solutions to the DMs with threefold important key
   features. First, the modeled and solved vehicle routing problem is
   general and can consider several landfills, set of vehicles with
   different capacities and speeds, several shifts and routes satisfying
   capacity, and time constraints. Second, the traveling times are obtained
   by the routes and the distances are determined by Google Map application
   programming interface, the traffic, and weather forecasts. Third, the
   solutions are obtained in extremely short times, even if the dimensions
   of the problem are very large. Future research aims at extending the
   U-DSS by considering dynamic routing and modifying in real time the
   planning of the routes with a suitable use of the modern information and
   communication technologies.}},

Abstract = {{The dramatic increase in the number and sensing capabilities of mobile
   devices is fostering opportunistic sensing as a paramount data
   collection paradigm in smart cities. According to this paradigm, sensing
   of large-scale phenomena is autonomously performed by mobile devices
   that provide irregular samples in time and space. The collected data is
   then transferred to a central controller, and processed so as to obtain
   a representation of the phenomenon. In this paper, we investigate the
   factors that impact the accuracy of mobile opportunistic sensing.
   Specifically, we characterize the accuracy of a phenomenon
   representation obtained from samples collected by mobile devices and
   processed through the popular LMMSE filter. We do so by drawing on
   random matrix theory, which allows us to deal with irregularly spaced
   samples. Our analytical expressions capture the fundamental
   relationships existing between the accuracy and the parameters of mobile
   opportunistic sensing. We apply our analytical results to a realistic
   scenario where atmospheric pollution samples are collected by vehicular
   and pedestrian users. We validate the proposed analytical framework, and
   then exploit the model to investigate the impact on mobile sensing
   accuracy of a number of parameters. These include the pedestrian and
   vehicle density, the participation ratio to the sensing application, the
   type of phenomenon to be sensed, and the level of noise and position
   errors affecting the collected samples.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the use of market segmentation techniques to promote
   sustainable transport has significantly increased. Populations are
   segmented into meaningful groups that share similar attitudes and
   preferences. This segmentation provides valuable information about how

   different user groups. In this paper, we aim to bridge between
   psychological, social marketing and ICT research in the field of

   high resolution mobility behaviour data, crowdsourced via mobile phones.
   We use support vector machines to map eight attitudinal segments, as
   defined under the European project SEGMENT, to the n dimensional space
   defined by crowdsourced data. The success rate of the proposed approach
   is 98.9\%. This demonstrates the applicability of the method as a way to
   automatically map attitudinal segments to a wider population based on
   observed mobility data instead of using explicit attitudinal surveys. In
   addition, the proposed approach can facilitate the delivery of

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks for smart city applications can be widely
   deployed, but they can also be vulnerable to be compromised by outsider
   attackers. It is, therefore, critical that the disseminated information

   guarantee the aforementioned requirements and the most popular depend on
   the location of the sensor to generate the required credentials. This
   paper presents a new location-dependent key management protocol (LKMP),

   protocol, the generated report of an event must contain a third level of
   endorsement handled by a set of cell reporters to be accepted by the

Abstract = {{The expansion of big data and the evolution of Internet of Things (IoT)
   technologies have played an important role in the feasibility of smart
   city initiatives. Big data offer the potential for cities to obtain
   valuable insights from a large amount of data collected through various
   sources, and the IoT allows the integration of sensors, radio-frequency
   identification, and Bluetooth in the real-world environment using highly
   networked services. The combination of the IoT and big data is an
   unexplored research area that has brought new and interesting challenges
   for achieving the goal of future smart cities. These new challenges
   focus primarily on problems related to business and technology that
   enable cities to actualize the vision, principles, and requirements of
   the applications of smart cities by realizing the main smart environment
   characteristics. In this paper, we describe the state-of-the-art
   communication technologies and smart based applications used within the
   context of smart cities. The visions of big data analytics to support
   smart cities are discussed by focusing on how big data can fundamentally
   change urban populations at different levels. Moreover, a future
   business model of big data for smart cities is proposed, and the
   business and technological research challenges are identified. This
   study can serve as a benchmark for researchers and industries for the
   future progress and development of smart cities in the context of big

Abstract = {{To date, building energy management systems (BEMS) have been well
   established in the large scale non domestic field as an energy saving
   technology, contributing towards sustainable future cities. They utilise
   complex control interfaces, with control signals passed through purpose
   built communication wiring. Estimated end-use energy savings, due to
   BEMS addition, can reach up to 50\%, with associated financial savings
   for building users. The intelligent control, featured in BEMS, enables
   buildings to adapt; optimising operation based on up to date weather
   forecasts. Despite the positive savings for future sustainable cities,
   the additional wiring required and complex control interfaces have
   inhibited wide scale up take for small and medium sized commercial
   buildings. Retrofit installation is often time consuming, whilst
   efficient operation requires additional training for users. BEMS, based
   on wireless communication technology, are limited by radio-wave
   reception and therefore suffer in heavyweight constructions and larger
   premises (greater than 1000 sqm). Following review of available
   technologies, this paper investigates a novel strategy utilising
   power-line communication (PLC) for BEMS communication, for versatile
   applications in the small to medium sized non-domestic (SMSND) premises
   that make up future sustainable cities. The PLC strategy intends to send
   BEMS control signals via the established electrical wiring network.
   Before implementation of this concept, further work is required to
   overcome the more challenging aspects of PLC technology. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{With the pervasive of the definition of the smart city, the data volume
   of the surveillance system, huge number of video surveillance devices is
   now rapidly expanding. The research to surveillance data mining and
   analytics has attracted increasing attention due to its applications.
   Cluster analysis as an important task of data mining in video
   surveillance has recently been highly explored. K-means algorithm is the
   most popular and widely-used partitional clustering algorithm in
   practice. However, traditional k-means algorithm suffers from sensitive
   initial selection of cluster centers, and it is not easy to specify the
   number of clusters in advance. In this paper, we propose a robust
   k-means algorithm that can automatically split and merge clusters which
   incorporates the new ideas in dealing with huge scale of video data.
   This novel algorithm not only addresses the sensitivity in selecting
   initial cluster centers, but also is resilient to the initial number of
   clusters. The performance is experimentally verified using synthetic and
   publicly available datasets. The experiments demonstrate the
   effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover,
   experiment is conducted on a real video surveillance dataset and the
   result shows that the novel approach can be applicated friendly in video

Abstract = {{A scheme using satellite-derived irradiance measurements to model the
   feed-in power of residential photovoltaic (PV) systems in a low voltage
   distribution grid is described. It is validated against smart meter
   measurements from a test site with 12 residential PV systems in the city
   of UIm, Germany, during May 2013 to December 2014. The PV feed-in power
   is simulated in a 15-min time resolution based on irradiance data
   derived from Meteosat Second Generation satellite images by the
   physically based retrieval scheme Heliosat-4. The PV simulation is based
   on the nominal power and location of the PV systems as provided by the
   distribution system operator. Orientation angles are taken from high
   resolution aerial laser-scan data. The overall average mean error of PV
   feed-in power is 4.6\% and the average root-mean squared error is 12.3\%
   for the individual systems. Relative values are given with respect to
   the total installed power of 152.3 kWp. Sensitivity studies discuss the
   need for knowing the exact orientation angles of each individual PV
   system or the usefulness of a single ground-based measurement as
   alternative to satellite observations. As an application of the scheme,
   the modelling of the effect of the power flow from the residential PV on
   the load flow of the low voltage distribution grid transformer is
   described and illustrates the advantage of the discussed approach for

Abstract = {{Background: Millions of Americans need but don't receive treatment for
   substance use, and evidence suggests that addiction-focused
   interventions on smart phones could support their recovery. There is
   little research on implementation of addiction-related interventions in
   primary care, particularly in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)
   that provide primary care to underserved populations. We used mixed
   methods to examine three FQHCs' implementation of Seva, a smart-phone
   app that offers patients online support/discussion, health-tracking, and
   tools for coping with cravings, and offers clinicians information about
   patients' health tracking and relapses. We examined (a) clinicians'
   initial perspectives about implementing Seva, and (b) the first year of
   implementation at Site 1.
   Methods: Prior to staggered implementation at three FQHCs (Midwest city
   in WI vs. rural town in MT vs. metropolitan NY), interviews, meetings,
   and focus groups were conducted with 53 clinicians to identify core
   themes of initial expectations about implementation. One year into
   implementation at Site 1, clinicians there were re-interviewed. Their
   reports were supplemented by quantitative data on clinician and patient
   use of Seva.
   Results: Clinicians anticipated that Seva could help patients and make
   behavioral health appointments more efficient, but they were skeptical
   that physicians would engage with Seva (given high caseloads), and they
   were uncertain whether patients would use Seva. They were concerned
   about legal obligations for monitoring patients' interactions online,
   including possible ``cries for help{''} or inappropriate interactions.
   One year later at Site 1, behavioral health care providers, rather than
   physicians, had incorporated Seva into patient care, primarily by
   discussing it during appointments. Given workflow/load concerns, only a
   few key clinicians monitored health tracking/relapses and prompted
   outreach when needed; two researchers monitored the discussion board and
   alerted the clinic as needed. Clinician turnover/leave complicated this
   approach. Contrary to clinicians' initial concerns, patients showed
   sustained, mutually supportive use of Seva, with few instances of
   misuse.
   Conclusions: Results suggest the value of (a) focusing implementation on
   behavioral health care providers rather than physicians, (b) assigning a
   few individuals (not necessarily clinicians) to monitor health tracking,
   relapses, and the discussion board, (c) anticipating turnover/ leave and
   having designated replacements. Patients showed sustained, positive use

Title = {{Smart energy systems for smart city districts: case study Reininghaus
   District}},
Journal = {{ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Dense settlement structures in cities have high demands of
   energy. Usually, these demands exceed the local resource availability.
   Individually developed supply options to cover these demands differ from
   place to place and can also vary within the boundaries of a city. In a
   common sense of European governance, cities are pushed to save energy,
   increase renewables and reduce import dependency on fossil fuels. There
   are many innovative concepts and technologies available to tackle these
   needs. The paper provides a comprehensive methodology for planning and
   assessing the development of `smart' energy systems leading to complex
   energy provision technology networks using different on-site as well as
   off-site resources.
   Methods: The use of the P-graph (process-graph) method allows the
   optimisation of energy systems by using different energy sources for
   heating, storing and cooling. This paper discusses this method in the
   development of an urban brown field, the premises of the Reininghaus
   District, a former brewery in the city of Graz in Austria. The case
   study is interesting as it combines on-site energy sources (e.g. solar
   heat and photovoltaic) with nearby industrial waste heat and cooling at
   different temperatures and grid-based resources such as existing
   district heating, natural gas, and electricity. The case study also
   includes the competition between centralised technologies (e.g. large
   scale combined heat and power and heat pumps with district heating
   grids) and decentralised technologies (e.g. small scale combined heat
   and power, single building gas boilers, solar collectors, etc. in
   buildings). Ecological assessment with the Energetic Long-Term Analysis
   of Settlement Structures (ELAS) calculator provides an evaluation of the
   ecological impact of the developed energy systems.
   Results: Different scenarios based on two building standards OIB (low
   energy house standard) and NZE (passive house standard) as well as
   different prices for key energy resources were developed for an urban
   development concept for the Reininghaus District. The results of these
   scenarios show a very wide spectrum of structures of the energy system
   with strong variations often caused by small changes in cost or prices.
   The optimisation shows that small changes in the setup of the price/cost
   structure can cause dramatic differences in the optimal energy system to
   supply a smart city district. However, decentralised systems with
   low-temperature waste heat and decentralised heat pumps in the building
   groups show the financially most feasible and, compared to alternatives,
   most ecological way to supply the new buildings.
   Conclusions: The planning process for the development of the Reininghaus
   District is a complex and therefore lengthy process and shall be
   concretised over the next decades. Optimal energy technology networks
   and scenarios resulting from the application of the described methods
   support the framework energy plan. The accumulated knowledge can be used
   to form smart energy supply solutions as an integral part for the
   discussion of the stakeholders (investors, city department) to guide the
   forming of their action plan through the development of the city

Abstract = {{Smart city and innovative building strategies are becoming increasingly
   more necessary because advancing a sustainable building system is
   regarded as a promising solution to overcome the depleting water and
   energy. However, current sustainable building systems mainly focus on
   energy saving and miss a holistic integration of water regeneration and
   energy generation. Here, we present a theoretical study of a solar
   optics-based active panel (SOAP) that enables both solar energy storage
   and photothermal disinfection of greywater simultaneously. Solar
   collector efficiency of energy storage and disinfection rate of
   greywater have been investigated. Due to the light focusing by
   microlens, the solar collector efficiency is enhanced from 25\% to 65\%,
   compared to that without the microlens. The simulation of greywater
   sterilization shows that 100\% disinfection can be accomplished by our
   SOAP for different types of bacteria including Escherichia coli.
   Numerical simulation reveals that our SOAP as a lab-on-a-wall system can
   resolve the water and energy problem in future sustainable building
   systems. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Regular citizens equipped with smart devices are being increasingly used
   as sensors by Smart Cities applications. Using contacts among users,
   data in the form of messages is obtained and shared. Contact-based
   messaging applications are based on establishing a short-range
   communication directly between mobile devices, and on storing the
   messages in these devices for subsequent delivery to cloud-based
   services. An effective way to increase the number of messages that can
   be shared is to increase the contact duration. We thus introduce the
   Friendly-Sharing diffusion approach, where, during a contact, the users
   are aware of the time needed to interchange the messages stored in their
   buffers, and they can thus decide to wait more time in order to increase
   the message sharing probability. The performance of this approach is
   anyway closely related to the size of the buffer in the device. We
   therefore compare various policies either for the message selection at
   forwarding times and for message dropping when the buffer is full. We
   evaluate our proposal with a modified version of the Opportunistic
   Networking Environment (ONE) simulator and using real human mobility

Abstract = {{This article discusses the idea of city as a platform. The analysis
   focuses on the forms and implications of citizen involvement in
   publicly-supported participatory innovation platforms that facilitate
   urban economic development in the welfare society context. The
   discussion opens with a review of the smart city discourse, which in the
   context of economic development policy translates into cities' need to

   innovation platform is a prime example of such an environment. The
   empirical section discusses three cases, those of the Finnish cities of
   Helsinki, Tampere, and Oulu. The analysis shows that platformization in
   the first half of the 2010s became a strategic focal area supported by
   national and EU programs. Platforms are used to support both urban
   revitalization and economic development, of which the former is based on
   representative and the latter on instrumental modes of participation.
   Platforms are well integrated with city governments, even though they
   vary greatly in terms of organizational forms and scopes. Democratic
   culture, welfarism, and redistributive policy provide contextual support

Journal = {{ENERGIES}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In smart cities, advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) of the smart
   grid facilitates automated metering, control and monitoring of power
   distribution by employing a wireless network. Due to this wireless
   nature of communication, there exist potential threats to the data
   privacy in AMI. Decoding the energy consumption reading, injecting false
   data/command signals and jamming the networks are some hazardous
   measures against this technology. Since a smart meter possesses limited
   memory and computational capability, AMI demands a light, but robust
   security scheme. In this paper, we propose a localization-based key
   management system for meter data encryption. Data are encrypted by the
   key associated with the coordinate of the meter and a random key index.
   The encryption keys are managed and distributed by a trusted third party
   (TTP). Localization of the meter is proposed by a method based on
   received signal strength (RSS) using the maximum likelihood estimator
   (MLE). The received packets are decrypted at the control center with the
   key mapped with the key index and the meter's coordinates. Additionally,
   we propose the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm for node/meter
   authentication, capitalizing further on data transmission security.
   Finally, we evaluate the security strength of a data packet numerically
   for our method.}},

Abstract = {{Imagining tomorrow's life implies, to a large degree, imagining the kind
   of cities we will inhabit in the future. In this framework, the smart
   city is actually a popular vision in discourses on urban development.
   This paper explores alternative ways in which citizens are positioned
   within different imaginaries of the smart city. The premise is that most
   mainstream discourses implicitly assume that smart city projects will
   empower and improve the lives of citizens. However, their role is often
   ambiguous. While some visions of the smart city are characterised by the
   absence of citizen's voices, others are populated by active citizens
   operating as urban sensors. Furthermore there are fearful visions of a
   future in which citizens will be subjugated by technologies that will
   hamper their freedom. This paper analyses the role of citizens in four
   alternative smart city imaginaries. The thesis proposed is that all four
   imaginaries are characterised by citizens playing a subaltern role, and
   hence the smart city is a relatively poor concept if intended as a model
   of the urban life of the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A survey was conducted to study the characteristics of parking in
   central Shanghai, with the selected survey areas classified as typical
   market areas, business- and office-oriented areas, and food- and
   drink-oriented areas. Different land use types and parking facilities
   were analyzed based on characteristic parking indexes, including parking
   saturation, peak parking ratio, parking turnover rate, and parking
   duration. It was found that market areas and food- and drink-oriented
   areas exhibit high parking saturation; in business- and office-oriented
   areas, the total parking space supply is sufficient to meet current
   parking demands, but the proportion of spaces open for visitor parking
   is insufficient. In market areas and business- and office-oriented
   areas, the occupancy of unfenced surface parking lots is generally
   higher than that of fenced car parks or garages. Moreover, some garages
   are inconveniently located and lack guidance information, which results
   in a low parking space utilization rate. Furthermore, policies are
   proposed to improve parking in Shanghai based on the city's current
   parking status. Parking supply policies are suggested for market areas,
   business- and office-oriented areas, food- and drink-oriented areas, and
   public car parks and garages. Pricing differentiation strategies and
   information technology (such as parking guidance technology and smart
   meters with demand-responsive pricing) should be applied to rebalance
   the use of all parking facility types and to provide drivers with more
   parking choices in Shanghai. An integrated public transport system
   (including urban rail transit, feeder buses, shuttle buses, and publicly
   shared bikes) should be developed to improve the share of public
   transport in traffic, which will alleviate future parking difficulties

Abstract = {{In this paper, I examine the convergence of big data and urban
   governance beyond the discursive and material contexts of the smart
   city. I argue that in addition to understanding the intensifying
   relationship between data, cities, and governance in terms of regimes of
   automated management and coordination in actually existing' smart
   cities, we should further engage with urban algorithmic governance and
   governmentality as material-discursive projects of future-ing, i.e., of
   anticipating particular kinds of cities-to-come. As urban big data looks
   to the future, it does so through the lens of an anticipatory security
   calculus fixated on identifying and diverting risks of urban anarchy and
   personal harm against which life in cities must be securitized. I
   suggest that such modes of algorithmic speculation are discernible at
   two scales of urban big data praxis: the scale of the body, and that of
   the city itself. At the level of the urbanite body, I use the selective
   example of mobile neighborhood safety apps to demonstrate how
   algorithmic governmentality enacts digital mediations of individual
   mobilities by routing individuals around unsafe' parts of the city in
   the interests of technologically ameliorating the risks of urban
   encounter. At the scale of the city, amongst other empirical examples,
   sentiment analytics approaches prefigure ephemeral spatialities of civic
   strife by aggregating and mapping individual emotions distilled from
   unstructured real-time content flows (such as Tweets). In both of these
   instances, the urban futures anticipated by the urban big data security
   assemblage' are highly uneven, as data and algorithms cannot divest
   themselves of urban inequalities and the persistence of their
   geographies.}},

Abstract = {{In a growing debate about the smart city, considerations of the ways in

   governmental intervention operating at the conjunction of the grid and
   the city. We seek to move beyond examining the rationales and discourses
   of such interventions to engage with the ways in which they are
   actualised in and through particular urban conditions in order to draw
   attention to their material politics. In so doing, we argue that the
   urban is not a mere backdrop to transitions in electricity provision and

   the ways in which we should understand the politics of urbanism.}},

Abstract = {{The electrification of transportation in Germany has failed so far, but
   the disappointment has given way to more radical visions and new
   coalitions. Utilities, grid operators, and ICT companies have started to
   challenge the traditional image of the car. In their future scenarios,
   transportation, energy, and communication infrastructures must be
   aligned in order to achieve a sustainable society. This paper explores
   the co-production and enactment of this technological vision using the
   analytical framework of sociotechnical imaginaries. First, I describe
   how the idea of the electric vehicle as energy infrastructure was able
   to take hold within the German expert community. To understand how this
   approach might transform the existing mobility and energy practices, I
   examine two of the first R\&D experiments that have enacted this vision
   in two radically different ways. Both reflect unarticulated assumptions
   about social life, including implicit cultural notions of
   self-determination, ownership, living arrangements, privacy, and

Abstract = {{The smart cities initiative encourages cities to improve their
   performance in the three pillars of sustainability, namely
   environmental, economic, and social. The smart cities movement is
   distinguished from sustainable cities by its use of intelligent
   technologies to attain sustainability. The smart cities world-class
   initiative is the first and only urban movement to generate interest on
   the part of all urban stakeholders. This includes citizens, governments,
   and even industry, which is the most interested party due to its
   opportunities to sell tech solutions and services to governments, in
   order to better serve citizens. However, although there are many
   technological means to help cities successfully perform in the three
   pillars of sustainability, social sustainability of smart cities is not
   yet fully considered. And this constitutes a lost opportunity to
   positively impact citizens' lives. This research proposes a mechanism to
   account for the social pillar of sustainability, which consists of
   measuring the ``citizen-centeredness{''} of city policies and local
   governance. This citizen-centric approach is measured by monitoring
   performance of cities in safeguarding citizenship rights. Accordingly, a
   set of indicators measuring the safeguarding of citizens' rights in the
   city included in its fundamental text, The European Charter for the
   Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City, has been elaborated.
   Acknowledging the potential of market standards promoted by national and
   international standardization bodies such as the International Standards
   Organization or the National Standardization Association in Spain,
   proposed indicators have been designed to serve as a basis for what
   could be the first-ever social standard. Since market standards have an
   econometric nature, this research has been carried out in total fairness
   to city council responsibilities, only accounting for those which are
   mandatory, for which a budget is assigned. Finally, in the last section
   of the paper, conclusions show the triple-win-for citizens, private
   stakeholders, and city councils, that the inclusion of social standards
   brings into the governance of cities.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we propose a travel itinerary problem (TIP) which aims to
   find itineraries with the lowest cost for travelers visiting multiple
   cities, under the constraints of time horizon, stop times at cities and
   transport alternatives with fixed departure times, arrival times, and
   ticket prices. First, we formulate the TIP into a 0-1 integer
   programming model. Then, we decompose the itinerary optimization into a
   macroscopic tour (i.e., visiting sequence between cities) selection
   process and a microscopic number (i.e., flight number, train number for
   each piece of movement) selection process, and use an implicit
   enumeration algorithm to solve the optimal combination of tour and
   numbers. By integrating the itinerary optimization approach and Web
   crawler technology, we develop a smart travel system that is able to
   capture online transport data and recommend the optimal itinerary that
   satisfies travelers' preferences in departure time, arrival time, cabin
   class, and transport mode. Finally, we present case studies based on
   real-life transport data to illustrate the usefulness of itinerary
   optimization for minimizing travel cost, the computational efficiency of
   the implicit enumeration algorithm, and the feasibility of the smart

Pages = {{511-524}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The rapid developments of ubiquitous mobile computing provide planners
   and researchers with new opportunities to understand and build smart
   cities by mining the massive spatial-temporal mobility data. However,
   given the increasing complexity and volume of the emerging mobility
   datasets, it also becomes challenging to build novel analytical
   framework that is capable of understanding the structural properties and
   critical features. In this paper, we introduce an analytical framework
   to deal with high-dimensional human mobility data. To this end, we
   formulate mobility data in a probabilistic setting and consider each
   record a multivariate observation sampled from an underlying
   distribution. In order to characterize this distribution, we use a
   multi-way probabilistic factorization model based on the concept of
   tensor decomposition and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA).
   The model provides us with a flexible approach to understand multi-way
   mobility involving higher-order interactions which are difficult to
   characterize with conventional approaches using simple latent
   structures. The model can be efficiently estimated using the expectation
   maximization (EM) algorithm. As a numerical example, this model is
   applied on a four-way dataset recording 14 million public transport
   journeys extracted from smart card transactions in Singapore. This
   framework can shed light on the modeling of urban structure by
   understanding mobility flows in both spatial and temporal dimensions.

Abstract = {{An infrastructure adapted to dynamic wireless recharging of electric
   vehicles is often referred to generically as Electric Road (e-road).
   E-roads are deemed to become essential components of future grid
   environments and smart city strategies. Several technologies already
   exist that propose different ways to integrate dynamic inductive
   charging systems within the infrastructure. One e-road solution uses a
   very thin rail with box-section made of fibre-reinforced polymer, inside
   which an electric current flows producing a magnetic field. In spite of
   the great interest and research generated by recharging technologies,
   the structural problems of e-roads, including vibrations and structural
   integrity in the short and/or long period, have received relatively
   little attention to date. This article presents a novel computational
   methodology for assessing the time-dependent structural performance of
   e-roads, including a recursive strategy for the estimation of the
   lifetime of surface layers. The article also reports some numerical
   findings about e-roads that will drive further numerical analyses and
   experimental studies on this novel type of infrastructure. Finally,

Abstract = {{Since the initial visions proposed in the SmartDust project fifteen
   years ago, Wireless Sensor Networks have seen a tremendous development,
   leading to the realization of the Internet of Things (IoT). Today, there
   is a large variety of hardware and software to choose from that is easy
   to set up and use. Even though there is an increasing number of
   real-world applications that employ large deployments of IoT devices,
   the wireless nature of communication in combination with the low-end
   capabilities of the devices raises security and privacy issues that have
   not been properly addressed. Considering also that sensor node brands
   are very different in their capabilities, providing a single solution is
   very challenging.
   In this paper we adopt Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) as an
   attractive alternative to conventional public key cryptography, such as
   RSA. ECC is an ideal candidate for implementation on constrained devices
   where the major computational resources, i.e., speed, memory are limited
   and low-power wireless communication protocols are employed. That is
   because it attains the same security levels with traditional
   cryptosystems using smaller parameter sizes. We provide a generic
   implementation of ECC that runs on different host operating systems,
   such as Contiki, TinyOS, iSenseOS, ScatterWeb and Arduino. Furthermore,
   it runs on smartphone platforms such as Android and iPhone and also any
   linux based systems (e.g., raspberryPi). Our implementation does not
   contain any platform-specific specializations, allowing a single
   implementation to run natively on heterogeneous networks.
   We look into the Smart Parking application domain and provide a solution
   that protects the privacy of the users by totally avoiding the exchange
   of confidential information. We also show how to protect a user's
   privacy by adapting the tool of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) with our ECC
   implementation. We study the performance of our system in an real-world
   outdoor IoT testbed and analyze the execution time and network overhead
   for each available hardware platform. Our code is available as open
   source software and can be used from developers who wish to achieve
   certain levels of security and privacy in their applications. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Smart grid (SG) incorporates communication networks to conventional
   electricity system in order to intelligently integrate distributed
   energy resource (DERs) and to allow demand side management. The move to
   SG in developing countries has to cope with great disparities of
   information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures even
   within the same city. Besides, individual DERs are often too small to be
   allowed access to the energy market. Likewise power utilities are unable
   to effectively control and manage small DERs. An affordable and scalable
   wireless communication technology is proposed to aggregate
   geographically sparse DERs into a single virtual power plant (VPP). An
   ant colony optimization (ACO) method is used for the first time to the
   best of our knowledge in conjunction with geographic greedy forwarding
   protocol to effectively deliver data packets without void problems for
   VPP. The VPP investigated is dynamic and expected to scale up as more
   and more prosumers are attracted to join it. The proposed communication
   network and protocol follow the progression of the VPP to allow
   scalability and rapid deployment. The routing algorithm used for data
   communication within the VPP supports centralized, decentralized or
   fully distributed controlled VPP's DERs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cooperation transmission among mobile devices is critical for video

Abstract = {{This paper discusses smart cities and raises critical questions about

   Given increasingly challenging carbon reduction targets, the role of
   information and communication technology and the digital economy are
   increasingly championed as offering potential to contribute to meeting
   these targets within cities and buildings. This paper questions the
   faith being placed in smart or intelligent solutions through asking,
   what role then for the ordinary citizen? The smart approach often
   appears to have a narrow view of how technology and user-engagement can
   sit together, viewing the behaviour of users as a hurdle to overcome
   rather than a resource to be utilised. This paper suggests lessons can
   be learnt from other disciplines and wider sustainable development
   policy that champions the role of citizens and user-engagement to
   harness the co-creation of knowledge, collaboration and empowerment.
   Specifically, empirical findings and observations are presented from a
   case study of citizen engagement around an energy-from-waste
   infrastructure development. Recommendations are provided for engineers,

Abstract = {{Due to the widespread usage of Internet of things devices in

Abstract = {{In this paper, intelligent traffic surveillance system as an important
   part of a smart resilient city is reviewed. The smart traffic control
   system is very important in improving the lifestyle by decreasing the
   traffic saturation and air pollution. Still, multi-camera vision is more
   helpful in implementing different automatic traffic surveillance
   systems. Apart from their superior features, existing multi-camera
   surveillance systems suffer from computational complexity and degraded
   accuracy. The main reason for these shortcomings arises from image
   processing errors. These errors depend on the image content and thus are
   not predictable. To overcome this shortage, three-dimensional (3D)
   optical techniques for improved fusing of the multi-camera images and
   thus extracting 3D vehicle locations is proposed in this paper. In fact,
   the proposed multi-camera visionary system is a combination of image
   processing based and geometrical optics based methods. The result of 3D
   image reconstruction through the proposed technique shows its dominance

Abstract = {{At present, battery-charging operations constitute one of the most
   critical obstacles toward a large-scale uptake of electric mobility
   (EM), due to performance issues and implementation complexities.
   Although several solutions based on the utilization of information and
   communication technologies and on mobile applications have been
   investigated to assist electric vehicle (EV) drivers and to coordinate
   charging operations, there is still the problem of how to evaluate and
   validate such solutions on realistic scenarios, due to the lack of
   accurate simulators integrating vehicular mobility, wireless
   communication, and battery charging/discharging models. In this paper,
   we attempt to fill this gap by proposing a novel EV simulation platform
   that can assist in the predeployment of charging infrastructures and
   services on realistic large-scale EM scenarios. The simulation platform,
   which is realized within the ARTEMIS EU project ``Internet of Energy for
   Electric Mobility,{''} supports two utilization modes, i.e., evaluation
   of EM scenarios and immersive emulation of EM-related mobile
   applications, due to a semantic architecture through which virtual and
   real components can be integrated in a seamless way. We provide three
   major contributions with respect to the state of the art. First, we
   extend the existing cosimulation platform composed of SUMO (a vehicular
   traffic simulator) and OMNET++ (a network simulator) with realistic
   models of EVs, electric vehicle supply equipment, and ontology-based
   communication protocols that enable the deployment of city-wide mobile
   services (e.g., charging reservation). Second, we validate the battery
   model against the consumptions data of target EVs, and we evaluate the
   operations of EVs on a large-scale scenario (the city of Bologna,
   Italy), by analyzing the effectiveness of the charging reservation
   process and the resulting impact to the smart grid. Finally, we
   introduce the Mobile Application Zoo, which is a sandbox through which
   EM-related mobile applications can be seamlessly integrated within the
   simulation platform to be validated on virtual environments before their
   deployment on real scenarios, and we describe the implementation of an
   Android application for battery monitoring and charging reservation.}},

Abstract = {{Vision-based place recognition is becoming an increasingly viable
   component of navigation systems for autonomous robots and personal aids.
   However, attaining robustness to variations in environmental
   conditionssuch as time of day, weather and seasonand camera viewpoint
   remains a major challenge. Featureless, sequence-based place recognition
   techniques have demonstrated promise, but often rely on long image
   sequences, manually-tuned parameters and exhaustive sequence match
   searching through multiple locations and image scales. In this paper, we
   address these deficiencies by implementing a condition-invariant,
   sequence-based place recognition algorithm suitable for networked
   environments, such as city streets, and routes with lateral platform
   shift, such as multiple-lane roads. We achieve this capability by
   augmenting the traditional 1D image database with a directed graph to
   describe the branching of contiguous sections of imagery at
   intersections. A particle filter is then used to efficiently explore
   these paths, as well as various lateral positions synthesized by
   rescaling imagery. Our proposed approach eliminates manual tuning of
   sequence length parameters, improves localization on branched routes,
   improves overall place recognition accuracy and coverage, and reduces
   computational requirements. We evaluated the new method against the
   original SeqSLAM and SMART algorithms on two day-night, road-based
   datasets and a summer-winter train dataset, where it attained superior
   precision-recall performance and coverage in all environments. Together,
   these contributions represent a significant step towards the provision

   measures, e.g. indegree and inward distance, are important in explaining
   the smartness of cities. Based on this, we recommend that smart cities
   include city network characteristics in future planning.}},

Abstract = {{To improve quality of life as well as the adaptive capacity in the city
   of Rotterdam over the past 15 years there has been a lot of focus on
   improving green infrastructure and finding new ways for integrated
   planning. As many cities face similar challenges they are looking for
   novel approaches in urban ecosystem governance. The Rotterdam case can
   be an interesting example but can also reveal new questions to be
   researched.Before local policies and projects where developed a regional
   and urban green blue vision of how to improve overall quality of life
   using green infrastructure were developed. This provided policy
   frameworks for politicians, policymakers and other actors. Later on the
   same was done with Urban Waterplan 2, using the Rotterdam Watercity 2030
   vision document as a basis. This vision was the result of a stakeholder
   based planning process which was made for the International Architecture
   Biennale 2005. Within these frameworks many interesting projects have
   been built and tested in the city and city region; ranging from a) a
   roof park over a railway yard to connect neighbourhoods to the
   waterfront, to b) water squares and c) digging new waterways with
   connected walking and biking routes. To go from projects to an overall
   implementation at city level required tools and approaches for better
   decision making. For the `Dakpark' project as well as for the
   Zomerhofkwartier, the first climate proof neighbourhood in the city,
   stakeholder sessions were held and plans were drawn together with urban
   planners and landscape architects. To feed these processes even better
   and to know what would be an optimal solution for certain challenges,
   city data were studied and linked to scalable GIS mapping in the `smart
   city planner'. This tool gives the decision maker the possibility to
   quickly have an overview of an area and can be used in a stakeholder
   process to provide relevant additional information and to define joint
   projects. The tool makes it possible to do this for all 90
   neighbourhoods in the city.Overall the urban ecosystem governance in the
   city of Rotterdam has - with trial and error- lead to a series of
   innovative projects. The next steps are acceleration and scaling up to
   city and regional level. Valuing the crucial role of green blue
   infrastructure for several aspects of the quality of life in cities are
   paramount. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Children represent a population group that is much neglected in the city

   similarity and heterogeneity in perception (e.g. based on gender and age

Title = {{An optimized grey model for annual power load forecasting}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{272-286}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Annual power load forecasting is essential for the planning, operation
   and maintenance of electric power system, which can also mirror the
   economic development of a country or region to some extent. Accurate
   annual power load forecasting can provide valuable reference for
   electric power system operators and economic managers. With the
   development of smart grid and renewable energy power, power load
   forecasting has become a more difficult and challenging task. In this
   paper, a hybrid optimized grey model (namely Grey Modelling (1, 1)
   optimized by Ant Lion Optimizer with Rolling mechanism, abbreviated as
   Rolling-ALO-GM (1, 1)) was proposed. The parameters of Grey Modelling
   (1, 1) were optimally determined by employing Ant Lion Optimizer, which
   is a new nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm. Meanwhile, the rolling
   mechanism was incorporated to improve the forecasting accuracy. Two
   cases of annual electricity consumption in China and Shanghai city were
   selected to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed
   Rolling-ALO-GM (1, 1) for annual power load forecasting. The empirical
   results indicate the proposed Rolling-ALO-GM (1, 1) model shows much
   better forecasting performance than Grey Modelling (1,1), Grey Modelling
   (1,1) optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey Modelling (1, 1)
   optimized by Ant Lion Optimizer, Generalized Regression Neural Network,
   Grey Modelling (1, 1) with Rolling mechanism, and Grey Modelling (1, 1)
   optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization with Rolling mechanism. Ant
   Lion Optimizer, as a new intelligence optimization algorithm, is
   attractive and promising. The Grey Modelling (1, 1) optimized by Ant
   Lion Optimizer with Rolling mechanism can significantly improve annual
   power load forecasting accuracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An increasing number of researchers and practitioners are working to
   develop smart cities. Considerable attention has been paid to the
   college campus as it is an important component of smart cities.
   Consequently, the question of how to construct a smart campus has become
   a topical one. Here, we propose a scheme that can facilitate the
   construction of a smart and friendly campus. We primarily focus on three
   aspects of smart campuses. These are: the formation of social circles
   based on interests mining, the provision of educational guidance based
   on emotion analysis of information posted on a platform, and development
   of a secondary trading platform aimed at optimizing the allocation of
   campus resources. Based on these objectives, we designed and implemented
   a mobile platform called OnCampus as the first step towards the
   development of a smart campus that has been introduced in some colleges.
   We found that OnCampus could successfully accomplish the three above
   mentioned functions of a smart campus.}},

Abstract = {{Some governments have proven social media's potential to generate value
   through co-creation and citizen participation, and municipalities are
   increasingly using these tools in order to become smart cities.
   Nevertheless, few public administrations have taken full advantage of
   all the possibilities offered by social media and, as a consequence,
   there is a shortage of case studies published on this topic. By
   analyzing the case study of the platform Santander City Brain, managed
   by the City Council of Santander (Spain), the current work contributes
   to broaden the knowledge on ambitious social media projects implemented
   by local public administrations for e-Government; therefore, this case
   can be useful for other public sector's initiatives. The case studied
   herein proves that virtual social media are effective tools for civil
   society, as it is able to set the political agenda and influence the
   framing of political discourse; however, they should not be considered
   as the main channel for citizen participation. Among the results
   obtained, the authors have found that several elements are required: the
   determination and involvement of the government, a designated community
   manager to follow up with the community of users, the secured privacy of
   its users, and a technological platform that is easy to use.
   Additionally, the Public Private Partnership model provides several
   advantages to the project, such as opening new sources of funding.}},

Abstract = {{Big data is driving the use of algorithm in governing mundane but
   mission-critical tasks. Algorithms seldom operate on their own and their
   (dis)utilities are dependent on the everyday aspects of data capture,
   processing and utilization. However, as algorithms become increasingly
   autonomous and invisible, they become harder for the public to detect
   and scrutinize their impartiality status. Algorithms can systematically
   introduce inadvertent bias, reinforce historical discrimination, favor a
   political orientation or reinforce undesired practices. Yet it is
   difficult to hold algorithms accountable as they continuously evolve
   with technologies, systems, data and people, the ebb and flow of policy
   priorities, and the clashes between new and old institutional logics.
   Greater openness and transparency do not necessarily improve
   understanding. In this editorial we argue that through unravelling the
   imperceptibility, materiality and governmentality of how algorithms
   work, we can better tackle the inherent challenges in the curatorial
   practice of data and algorithm. Fruitful avenues for further research on

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper a framework is constructed to hypothesize if and how smart
   city technologies and urban big data produce privacy concerns among the
   people in these cities (as inhabitants, workers, visitors, and
   otherwise). The framework is built on the basis of two recurring
   dimensions in research about people's concerns about privacy: one
   dimensions represents that people perceive particular data as more
   personal and sensitive than others, the other dimension represents that
   people's privacy concerns differ according to the purpose for which data
   is collected, with the contrast between service and surveillance
   purposes most paramount. These two dimensions produce a 2 x 2 framework
   that hypothesizes which technologies and data-applications in smart
   cities are likely to raise people's privacy concerns, distinguishing
   between raising hardly any concern (impersonal data, service purpose),
   to raising controversy (personal data, surveillance purpose). Specific
   examples from the city of Rotterdam are used to further explore and
   illustrate the academic and practical usefulness of the framework It is
   argued that the general hypothesis of the framework offers clear
   directions for further empirical research and theory building about
   privacy concerns in smart cities, and that it provides a sensitizing
   instrument for local governments to identify the absence, presence, or
   emergence of privacy concerns among their citizens. (C) 2016 The Author.

Journal = {{GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{524-534}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Smartness has recently emerged as a desirable characteristic of
   governments, cities, communities, infrastructures, and devices. Within
   the public sector, smart city has become a popular term and municipal
   governments around the world are using multiple strategies to become
   smarter. However, there is no consensus about what smartness means and
   how to identify its key components or dimensions. Some definitions
   highlight information technology and data, while others pay attention to
   sustainability, openness, innovation, or resiliency. Based on a review
   of current literature, this paper identifies multiple dimensions of
   smartness and proposes an integrative view that highlights how each
   dimension contributes to the understanding and development of smart
   governments. We argue that smartness should be conceptualized in a broad
   and multifaceted way. The framework we present serves as a foundation to
   understand and measure smartness in government and provides guidelines
   for the comprehensive development of smart governments. Some of the
   dimensions have been identified and studied explicitly in the realm of
   smart government. A number of other dimensions are embedded in the
   literature as individual characteristics of a good government; although
   they are not explicitly referenced in relationship to smart government,
   we argue that they are important components of a government being smart.
   The paper also suggests that public managers do not control all
   dimensions equally. Some dimensions could be seen as relatively direct
   outputs of their actions, while others Could be better understood as
   outcomes that could be affected, but not solely determined, by strategic
   interventions or deliberate actions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{There is an issue with the timely application of artificial intelligence
   to humankind, particularly to the disabled. In this paper, we propose a
   surface electromyography signal recognition system for prosthetic
   application to persons with disabled hands, which achieves simplicity,
   reliability, accuracy and a short response time by increasing the
   performance of each part of the system and the coordination between the
   interconnected components. First, a surface electromyography signal
   acquisition system was designed on the basis of the cost and processing
   speed. Second, a method called the extreme value' was carried out on the
   original signal containing five continuous movements, by separating the
   signal into isolated segments representing different postures, which
   made application of the system for daily use possible. Third, on the
   basis of time-domain, chaos-theory and time-frequency-domain analysis
   methods, four features, namely the average amplitude, fractal dimension,
   maximum Lyapunov exponent and wavelet coefficient, were extracted from
   four possible arm locations to be determined. Furthermore, the average
   amplitude from the extensor digitorum and the wavelet coefficient from
   the flexor pollicis longus were determined as the final features after
   comparing the clustering effects of the extracted features. Finally, a
   new strategy for classifying the different postures based on a
   back-propagation neural network was introduced to obtain an average
   system accuracy of 82.77\% for five continuous movements.}},

Abstract = {{In present day, software development methodology is mostly based on
   object-oriented paradigm. With the increase in the number of these
   software system, their effective maintenance aspects becomes a crucial
   factor. Most of the maintainability prediction models in literature are
   based on techniques such as regression analysis and simple neural
   network. In this paper, three artificial intelligence techniques (AI)
   such as hybrid approach of functional link artificial neural network
   (FLANN) with genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   and clonal selection algorithm (CSA), i.e., FLANN-Genetic (FGA and
   AFGA), FLANN-PSO (FPSO and MFPSO), FLANN-CSA (FCSA) are applied to
   design a model for predicting maintainability. These three AI techniques
   are applied to predict maintainability on two case studies such as
   Quality Evaluation System (QUES) and User Interface System (UIMS). This
   paper also focuses on the effectiveness of feature reduction techniques
   such as rough set analysis (RSA) and principal component analysis (PCA)
   when they are applied for predicting maintainability. The results show
   that feature reduction techniques are very effective in obtaining better
   results while using FLANN-Genetic. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   multilingual representation of concepts and entities}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{240}},
Pages = {{36-64}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Owing to the need for a deep understanding of linguistic items, semantic
   representation is considered to be one of the fundamental components of
   several applications in Natural Language Processing and Artificial
   Intelligence. As a result, semantic representation has been one of the
   prominent research areas in lexical semantics over the past decades.
   However, due mainly to the lack of large sense-annotated corpora, most
   existing representation techniques are limited to the lexical level and
   thus cannot be effectively applied to individual word senses. In this
   paper we put forward a novel multilingual vector representation, called
   NASARI, which not only enables accurate representation of word senses in
   different languages, but it also provides two main advantages over
   existing approaches: (1) high coverage, including both concepts and
   named entities, (2) comparability across languages and linguistic levels
   (i.e., words, senses and concepts), thanks to the representation of
   linguistic items in a single unified semantic space and in a joint
   embedded space, respectively. Moreover, our representations are
   flexible, can be applied to multiple applications and are freely
   available at http://1cl.uniroma1.it/nasari/. As evaluation benchmark, we
   opted for four different tasks, namely, word similarity, sense
   clustering, domain labeling, and Word Sense Disambiguation, for each of
   which we report state-of-the-art performance on several standard
   datasets across different languages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   is vast. The survey results showed that meeting summarisation is one of
   the most important new features that should be added to virtual meeting
   systems for enterprises. This paper highlights the innovative methods
   employed in V-ROOM to produce relevant meeting summaries. V-ROOM's
   approach is compared to other methods from the literature, and it is
   shown how the use of metadata provided by parts of the V-ROOM system can

Title = {{A comparative study on multiobjective metaheuristics for solving
   constrained in-core fuel management optimisation problems}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{174-190}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the topic of constrained multiobjective in-core fuel
   management optimisation (MICFMO) using metaheuristics is considered.
   Several modern and state-of-the-art metaheuristics from different
   classes, including evolutionary algorithms, local search algorithms,
   swarm intelligence algorithms, a probabilistic model-based algorithm and
   a harmony search algorithm, are compared in order to determine which
   approach is the most suitable in the context of constrained MICFMO. A
   test suite of 16 optimisation problem instances, based on the SAFARI-1
   nuclear research reactor, has been established for the comparative
   study. The suite is partitioned into three classes, each consisting of
   problem instances having a different number of objectives, but subject
   to the same stringent constraint set. The effectiveness of a
   multiplicative penalty function constraint handling technique is also
   compared with the constrained-domination technique from the literature.
   The different optimisation approaches are compared in a nonparametric
   statistical analysis. The analysis reveals that multiplicative penalty
   function constraint handling is a competitive alternative to
   constrained-domination, and seems to be particularly effective in the
   context of bi-objective optimisation problems. In terms of the
   metaheuristic solution comparison, it is found that the nondominated
   sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), the Pareto ant colony
   optimisation (P-ACO) algorithm and the multiobjective optimisation using
   cross-entropy method (MOOCEM) are generally the best-performing
   metaheuristics across all three problem classes, along with the
   multiobjective variable neighbourhood search (MOVNS) in the bi-objective
   problem class. Furthermore, the practical relevance of the metaheuristic
   results is demonstrated by comparing the solutions thus obtained to the
   current SAFARI-1 reload configuration design approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{343-355}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Credit risk evaluation is an integral part of any lending process, and
   even more so for financial institutions involved in lending to SMEs. The
   importance of credit scoring has increased recently because of the
   financial crisis and increased capital requirements for banks. There
   are, however, only few studies that develop credit coring models for SME
   lending. The objective of this study is to introduce a novel, more
   accurate credit risk estimation approach for SMEs business lending.
   Based on traditional statistical methods and recent artificial
   intelligence (AI) techniques, we proposed a hybrid model which combines
   the logistic regression approach and artificial neural networks (ANN).
   In order to test the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed
   hybrid model, we use the data of Finnish SMEs from the fiscal years 2004
   to 2012. Our results suggest that the proposed ANN/logistic hybrid model
   is more accurate than either of the initial models ANN or logistic
   regression. This improvement in the accuracy of the credit scoring model
   decreases evaluation errors and has thereby many potential practical
   implications. First of all, a more accurate credit scoring model can
   result in better performance of the whole SME loan portfolio. Second, it
   can also result in lower capital requirements from the banks perspective
   and lower interest rates from the individual firm's perspective.
   Combined, these effects will enhance the banks competitiveness in the
   market for SME loans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Image matching is one of fundamental importance in photogrammetry,
   remote sensing and computer vision. It has been used in 3D
   reconstruction, target tracking and other applications. Image matching
   aims to identify the correspondence between two different images of the
   same scene or objects in different poses, illumination conditions and
   environments. During the recent years, artificial bee colony (ABC) was
   proposed by scientists based on colony intelligence of bees, in order to
   resolve the complex problems artificial systems. The function of
   mutation operator in genetic algorithm lead to an extended search
   environment and discovery of a suitable result which equals with the
   best matching. ABC simulates the intelligent foraging behavior of a
   honeybee swarm. In this work, ABC technique is exploited to tackle the
   shape matching problem with this aim to find the matching between two
   shapes represented via sets of contour points. In this paper, the
   combination of these two methods, leads to the creation of our suggested
   method entitled: Modified Artificial Bee Colony (MABC). Experimental
   results in image matching shows that our proposed novel method performs
   much better performance than other algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial Immune System (AIS) is inspired from Biological Immune System
   (BIS) and demonstrates a lot of interesting facets and intelligence that
   include self-learning, self adaption, self regulatory, distributed with
   self/non-self detection capabilities. Due to these astonishing qualities
   AIS are predominantly used in anomaly detection where anomalies are
   treated as non-self that needs to be detected. Therefore, AIS appears
   appropriate for development of a proactive system to identify and
   prevent novel and unseen anomalies. This paper presents ``An Efficient
   Proactive Artificial Immune System based Anomaly Detection and
   Prevention System (EPAADPS){''} which embodies immune attributes to
   distinguish self and non-self in quest to identify and prevent novel,
   unseen anomalies. Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) is a key AIS
   concept and is used for anomaly detection in various publications.
   Despite its relative success, detector selection and thereafter anomaly
   detection demands a more effective algorithm. This paper put forwards
   concept of self-tuning of detectors and detector power in NSA with the
   intension to make a detector evolve and facilitate better and correct
   self and non-self coverage. Thereafter, agents accompanying detectors
   collaborate and communicate between themselves to proactively discover
   correct anomalies and then take appropriate preventive measures. The
   performance of EPAADPS is contrasted with closely related state of art
   RNS algorithm using real valued representation and Euclidean distance.
   Experimental results revels promising EPAADPS performance which very
   comfortably outperforms the RNS. Furthermore, these results also
   demonstrate that EPAADPS shows remarkable resilience and intelligence in
   detecting novel unseen anomalies and with preventive measures to
   overcome the threat perception. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To prevent drilling fluid losses into formation at the High Pressure
   High Temperature (HPHT) conditions in oil/gas wellbores, it is highly
   necessary to have enough information about rheology of the drilling
   fluid. The lack of global model to estimate the density of the drilling
   fluid at the wellbore conditions has adversely affected the plans of
   drilling fluid loss control. By gaining from a special sort of soft
   computing techniques, a new kind of intelligent based model developed by
   Suykens et al. and based on extended datasets reported in open
   literatures, it has noticeably become possible to defeat the
   aforementioned obstacles and elevate the performance of estimating the
   Drilling Fluid Density (g/cm(3)). In this regard, least square support
   vector machine was employed to predict rheology of the drilling fluid at
   wellbore conditions for different types of drilling fluids including oil
   based muds, water based muds, gas-aphrons. According to the average
   absolute relative deviation, correlation coefficient and mean square
   error (MSE), the proposed low parameter model has an acceptable
   robustness; integrity and reliability. Therefore, the proposed
   artificial intelligence based method can be considered as an alternative
   model to determine the Drilling Fluid Density (g/cm(3)) at wellbore
   condition when the essential experimental data are not obtainable or
   measureable. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Phytoremediation, is a promising biochemical process which has gained
   wide acceptance in remediating the contaminants from the soil.
   Phytoremediation process comprises of biochemical mechanisms such as
   adsorption, transport, accumulation and translocation. State-of-the-art
   modelling methods used for studying this process in soil are limited to
   the traditional ones. These methods rely on the assumptions of the model
   structure and induce ambiguity in its predictive ability. In this
   context, the Artificial Intelligence approach of Genetic programming
   (GP) can be applied. However, its performance depends heavily on the
   architect (objective functions, parameter settings and complexity
   measures) chosen. Therefore, this present work proposes a comprehensive
   study comprising of the experimental and numerical one. Firstly, the
   lead removal efficiency (\%) from the phytoremediation process based on
   the number of planted spinach, sampling time, root and shoot
   accumulation of the soil is measured. The numerical modelling procedure
   comprising of the two architects of GP investigates the role of the two
   objective functions (SRM and AIC) having two complexity measures: number
   of nodes and order of polynomial in modelling this process. The
   performance comparison analysis of the proposed models is conducted
   based on the three error metrics (RMSE, MAPE and R) and
   cross-validation. The findings reported that the models formed from GP
   architect using SRM objective function and order of polynomial as
   complexity measure performs better with lower size and higher
   generalization ability than those of AIC based GP models. 2-D and 3-D
   surface analysis on the selected GP architect suggests that the shoot
   accumulation influences (non-linearly) the lead removal efficiency the
   most followed by the number of planted spinach, the root accumulation
   and the sampling time. The present work will be useful for the experts
   to accurately determine lead removal efficiency based on the explicit GP
   model, thus saving the waste of input resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the quality of Internet of Things (IoT)
   environments in smart houses, large datasets containing interactions
   between people and ubiquitous environments are essential for hardware
   and software testing. Both testing and simulation require a substantial
   amount of time and volunteer resources. Consequently, the ability to
   simulate these ubiquitous environments has recently increased in
   importance. In order to create an easy-to-use simulator for designing
   ubiquitous environments, we propose a simulator and autonomous agent
   generator that simulates human activity in smart houses. The simulator
   provides a three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI) that
   enables spatial configuration, along with virtual sensors that simulate
   actual sensors. In addition, the simulator provides an artificial
   intelligence agent that automatically interacts with virtual smart
   houses using a motivation-driven behavior planning method. The virtual
   sensors are designed to detect the states of the smart house and its
   living agents. The sensed datasets simulate long-term interaction
   results for ubiquitous computing researchers, reducing the testing costs
   associated with smart house architecture evaluation. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{With the bursting development of machine learning and artificial
   intelligence, the pattern recognition based image processing techniques
   are growing faster than ever before. In this paper, we conduct
   theoretical analysis on the natural image super-resolution
   reconstruction algorithm based on compressive perception theory and deep
   learning model. The image restoration is the purpose of the degraded
   image processing which make its recovery as it had been before the
   degradation of ideal image. According to the views of Fourier optics,
   optical imaging system is a low pass filter, due to the general
   influence of optical diffraction. The deep neural network with
   hierarchical unsupervised training method stratified greed training
   beforehand matter will be the result of the training as the novel
   learning supervision probability model of the initial value to make good
   use of the optical imaging system. The adopted compressed sensing theory
   points out that as long as signal is compressible or sparse, so, if
   there is a transformation matrix is not related observation matrix on
   signal can directly obtain compressed form of the original signal. Our
   research adopts the advances of the mentioned technique, in the training
   step, we use deep neural network to automatically capture the features
   and in the reconstruction procedure we use the compressive sensing and
   dictionary learning theory to reconstruct the high resolution image. By
   enhancing both of the steps, our experimental result indicates the
   feasibility of the novel algorithm. The prospect is also discussed in

Abstract = {{The artificial bee colony (ABC) is one of the swarm intelligence
   algorithms used to solve optimization problems which is inspired by the
   foraging behaviour of the honey bees. In this paper, artificial bee
   colony with the rate of change technique which models the behaviour of
   scout bee to improve the performance of the standard ABC in terms of
   exploration is introduced. The technique is called artificial bee colony
   rate of change (ABC-ROC) because the scout bee process depends on the
   rate of change on the performance graph, replace the parameter limit.
   The performance of ABC-ROC is analysed on a set of benchmark problems
   and also on the effect of the parameter colony size. Furthermore, the
   performance of ABC-ROC is compared with the state of the art algorithms.

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we propose and implement a new model for context
   recognition and identification. Our work is motivated by the importance
   of ``working in context{''} for knowledge workers to stay focused and
   productive.
   A computer application that can identify the current context in which
   the knowledge worker is working can (among other things) provide the
   worker with contextual support, for example, by suggesting relevant
   information sources, or give an overview of how he or she spent his or
   her time during the day.
   We present a descriptive model for the context of a knowledge worker.
   This model describes the contextual elements in the work environment of
   the knowledge worker and how these elements relate to each other. This
   model is operationalized in an algorithm, the contextual interactive
   activation model (CIA), which is based on the interactive activation
   model by Rumelhart and McClelland. It consists of a layered connected
   network through which activation flows. We have tested CIA in a context
   identification setting. In this case, the data that we use as input is
   low-level computer interaction logging data.
   We found that topical information and entities were the most relevant
   types of information for context identification. Overall the proposed
   CIA model is more effective than traditional supervised methods in
   identifying the active context from sparse input data, with less
   labelled training data.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we propose the following hypothesis: the neuromodulatory
   mechanisms that control the emotional states of mammals can be
   translated and re-implemented in a computer by controlling the
   computational performance of a hosted computational system. In our
   specific implementation, we represent the simulation of the `fear-like'
   state based on the three dimensional neuromodulatory model of affects,
   in this paper `affects' refer to the basic emotional inborn states,
   inherited from works of Hugo Ldvheim. Whilst dopamine controls
   attention, serotonin is the key for inhibition, and fear is a elicitator
   for inhibitory and protective processes. This inhibition can promote
   {[}in a cognitive system] to blocking behaviour which can be labelled as
   `depression'. Therefore, our interest is how to reimplement
   biomimetically both action-regulators without the computational system
   to resulting in a `failed' scenario. We have simulated 1000 ms of the
   dopamine system using NEST Neural Simulation Tool with the rat brain as
   the model. The results of the simulation experiments are reported with
   an evaluation to demonstrate the correctness of our hypothesis. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Companion or `pet' robots can be expected to be an important part of a
   future in which robots contribute to our lives in many ways. An
   understanding of emotional interactions would be essential to such
   robots' behavior. To improve the cognitive and behavior systems of such
   robots, we propose the use of an artificial topological consciousness
   that uses a synthetic neurotransmitter and motivation, including a
   biologically inspired emotion system. A fundamental aspect of a
   companion robot is a cross communication system that enables natural
   interactions between humans and the robot. This paper focuses on three
   points in the development of our proposed framework: (1) the
   organization of the behavior including inside-state emotion regarding
   the phylogenetic consciousness-based architecture; (2) a method whereby
   the robot can have empathy toward its human user's expressions of
   emotion; and (3) a method that enables the robot to select a facial
   expression in response to the human user, providing instant human-like
   `emotion' and based on emotional intelligence (El) that uses a
   biologically inspired topological online method to express, for example,
   encouragement or being delighted. We also demonstrate the performance of
   the artificial consciousness based on the complexity level and a robot's
   social expressions that are designed to enhance the users affinity with
   the robot. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A novel biologically inspired computational framework for visual
   tracking task}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{68-79}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Visual tracking is a process in which the location of one or several
   objects is estimated in a video sequence based on their appearance. High
   diversity of states and conditions of a moving stimulus and the
   existence of abundant challenges such as a cluttered background,
   variations in the objects appearance, and occlusion make this problem
   very complicated. Although a wide range of diverse algorithms have been
   introduced in this field, even the state-of-art ones have not been able
   to achieve high accuracy in facing different challenges of this problem.
   Nevertheless, by observing the biological world and paying attention to
   the living beings, particularly humans, it is revealed that the
   biological visual system performs the visual tracking task ideally.
   Therefore, inspiring from this biological system and especially its
   spatiotemporal processing, motion perception, attention, and saliency
   mechanism, in this paper a new biologically inspired visual tracking
   framework is proposed. The suggested framework includes a six-phase
   process in which the executive blocks, their connections, and
   information flow among them are inspired by the visual cortex. Using
   visual features extracted in primary layers of the visual cortex as well
   as the local-global and sparse representation of the object of interest
   make possible to employ the proposed framework in different conditions.
   In this paper, the theory of the suggested framework and its biological
   background is explained. Investigating the procedure of proposed
   framework from the viewpoint of employed features, spatiotemporal
   process, and the quiddity of local-global processing indicated that this
   framework enjoys the ability to manage most of the mentioned challenges,
   and can robustly track the object of interest in real conditions and
   application. This paper seeks to bridge biological and machine visions
   in order to bring the robustness, speed, and accuracy of biological
   vision into the artificial intelligence world. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Introduction: This research article is an update of the project ``Expert
   System for the selection of plastic materials for the design and
   preparation of new products{''}, developed in 1990 by the Central
   University ``Marta Abreu{''} of Las Villas. The objective of the current
   research, conducted in the year 2015 by the Cooperative University of
   Colombia, is to update the expert system developed in 1990. Methodology:
   The Common kads methodology was used for the development of the expert
   system, which allows the structuration of knowledge by creating a
   distinction between different domains of application, task and
   inference, thus enabling the reuse of components. During the inference
   process, a search direction directed by objectives was used, due to the
   characteristics of knowledge contained in the bases, in which the
   inference process is initiated without preliminary information. Results:
   The newer version of the system improves the inferences, offers a more
   user-friendly interface and extends knowledge. Discussion: The addition
   of knowledge bases, adapted to new situations, has an effect in the
   elicitation of better and more substantiating research answers, and the
   implementation of the new system over UCShell 3.0 provides a remarkable
   improvement in the interface, including the possibility of offering
   images and video during the inference process and admitting knowledge
   bases of any size while facilitating their exchange.}},

Abstract = {{Cement is the most widely used additive in soft soil stabilization due
   to its high strength and availability. The cement content and curing
   time have a direct influence on the stabilization cost and hence it is
   prudent to minimize these variables to achieve optimality. Thus, it is a
   classical multi-objective optimization problem to find the optimum
   combination of cement content used and the curing time provided to
   achieve the target strength. This paper brings out the use of Vector
   Evaluated Artificial Bee Colony (VEABC) algorithm, a multi-objective
   variant of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) technique, for the problem on
   hand. VEABC is a swarm intelligence algorithm, which employs multiple
   swarms to handle the multiple objectives and the information migration
   between these swarms ensures a global optimum solution is reached. Due
   to the stochastic nature of ABC algorithm, the resulting Pareto Curve
   will cover a good range of data with smooth transition. The Pareto
   fronts obtained for target strength could be used as calibration charts
   for scheduling the soft soil stabilization activities.}},

Abstract = {{Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is now widely used method in
   increasing the photovoltaic (PV) efficiency. The conventional MPPT
   methods have many problems concerning the accuracy, flexibility and
   efficiency. The MPP depends on the PV temperature and solar irradiation
   that randomly varied. In this paper an artificial intelligence based
   controller is presented through implementing of an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy
   Inference System (ANFIS) to obtain maximum power from PV. The ANFIS
   inputs are the temperature and cell current, and the output is optimal
   voltage at maximum power. During operation the trained ANFIS senses the
   PV current using suitable sensor and also senses the temperature to
   determine the optimal operating voltage that corresponds to the current
   at MPP. This voltage is used to control the boost converter duty cycle.
   The MATLAB simulation results shows the effectiveness of the ANFIS with
   sensing the PV current in obtaining the MPPT from the PV.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale integration of wind turbine generators (WTGs) may have

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Reinforcement learning, a general and universally useful framework for
   learning from experience, has been broadly recognized as a critically
   important concept for understanding and shaping adaptive behavior, both
   in ethology and in artificial intelligence. A key component in
   reinforcement learning is the reward function, which, according to an
   emerging consensus, should be intrinsic to the learning agent and a
   matter of appraisal rather than a simple reflection of external
   outcomes. We describe an approach to intrinsically motivated
   reinforcement learning that involves various aspects of happiness,
   operationalized as dynamic estimates of well-being. In four experiments,
   in which simulated agents learned to explore and forage in simulated
   environments, we show that agents whose reward function properly
   balances momentary (hedonic) and longer-term (eudaimonic) well-being
   outperform agents equipped with standard fitness-oriented reward
   functions. Our findings suggest that happiness-based features can be
   useful in developing robust, general-purpose reward mechanisms for
   intrinsically motivated autonomous agents.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet is becoming increasingly popular as a communication
   channel. However, message transmissions via the Internet have some
   problems, such as information security, copyright protection, and so on.
   Therefore, we need a secure communication method to transmit messages
   via the Internet. Steganography is a technique that hides secret data
   into cover media by altering its most insignificant components, such
   that an unauthorized user will not be aware of the existence of the
   secret data. In recent years the development of artificial intelligence
   and fuzzy logic has started a new period in the whole science. The
   proposed scheme has taken into consideration the property that more
   information can be hidden into the edge areas rather than in the smooth
   areas. This scheme makes the use of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy
   edge detecting method as well as the modified LSB substitution method
   that causes the image quality and capacity to increase. The use of
   intuitionistic fuzzy sets not only improves the image quality, but it is
   also more accurate in detecting the edges and smooth areas. The proposed
   scheme is tested on different standard images with secret messages of
   various lengths. The experimental results show the ability of the
   proposed scheme. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The brain is naturally a parallel and distributed system. Reverse
   engineering a cognitive brain is considered to be a grand challenge. In
   this paper, we present the parallel brain simulator (PBS), a parallel

   as a universal parallel execution engine, which is aimed at reducing the
   complexity of distributed programming and providing an easy to use
   programmable platform for computational neuroscientists and artificial
   intelligence researchers for modeling and simulation of large-scale
   neural networks. As illustrative examples and validations, three
   brain-inspired neural networks which are built on PBS are introduced,
   including the 1:1 human hippocampus network, the 1:1 mouse whole-brain
   network and the CASIA brain simulator built for cognitive robotics. We
   deploy PBS on both commodity clusters and supercomputers, and a scalable
   performance is achieved. In addition, we provide evaluations on the
   scalability and performance of both lumped synapse-based simulation and
   non-lumped synapse-based simulation with different data-graph

Abstract = {{Stable system performance is mandatory to warrant the accuracy and
   reliability of biological results relying on small animal positron
   emission tomography (PET) imaging studies. This simple requirement sets
   the ground for imposing routine quality control (QC) procedures to keep
   PET scanners at a reliable optimal performance level. However, such
   procedures can become burdensome to implement for scanner operators,
   especially taking into account the increasing number of data acquisition
   channels in newer generation PET scanners. In systems using pixel
   detectors to achieve enhanced spatial resolution and contrast-to-noise
   ratio (CNR), the QC workload rapidly increases to unmanageable levels
   due to the number of independent channels involved. An artificial
   intelligence based QC system, referred to as Scanner Intelligent
   Diagnosis for Optimal Performance (SIDOP), was proposed to help reducing
   the QC workload by performing automatic channel fault detection and
   diagnosis. SIDOP consists of four high-level modules that employ machine
   learning methods to perform their tasks: Parameter Extraction, Channel
   Fault Detection, Fault Prioritization, and Fault Diagnosis. Ultimately,
   SIDOP submits a prioritized faulty channel list to the operator and
   proposes actions to correct them. To validate that SIDOP can perform QC
   procedures adequately, it was deployed on a LabPET (TM) scanner and
   multiple performance metrics were extracted. After multiple corrections
   on sub-optimal scanner settings, a 8.5\% (with a 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) of {[}7.6, 9.3]) improvement in the CNR, a 17.0\% (CI:
   {[}15.3, 18.7]) decrease of the uniformity percentage standard
   deviation, and a 6.8\% gain in global sensitivity were observed. These
   results confirm that SIDOP can indeed be of assistance in performing QC
   procedures and restore performance to optimal figures.}},

Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{34-45}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Hydration characteristics (moisture content, moisture ratio and
   hydration rate) of wheat kernel during soaking process were studied and
   simulated. Hydration procedure was performed at five different
   experimental water temperatures (30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 (degrees C)) with
   respect to hydration time changes. Hydration characteristics of samples
   were modeled using one of the most popular simulation frameworks of
   artificial intelligence, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).
   A comparison was also made between results of the best developed ANFIS
   model and those of the another well-known artificial intelligence
   technique, artificial neural network (ANN). The hydration temperature
   and time were used as input parameters and moisture content, moisture
   ratio. and hydration rate were taken as output parameters of the
   intelligent modeling frameworks. To attain the best model with the
   highest predictive ability, developed models were compared based on
   statistical parameters of coefficient of determination, root mean square
   error and mean relative deviation modulus. According to the results,
   although the best framework of both ANFIS and ANN were able to
   accurately predict hydration characteristics, the best ANN simulation
   framework with a simple structure (2-4-3) was easier to use than the
   ANFIS with three different structures. ANN surface plots also
   illustrated that increasing the hydration temperature and time increased
   moisture content and decreased moisture ratio. Moreover, ANN modeling
   results indicated that the hydration rate increased in the initial and
   decreased in the middle and final phase of hydration procedure. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to apply preprocessing and ensemble
   artificial intelligence classifiers to forecast daily maximum ozone
   threshold exceedances in the Hong Kong area. Preprocessing methods,
   including over-sampling, under-sampling, and the synthetic minority
   over-sampling technique, were employed to address the imbalance data
   problem. Ensemble algorithms are proposed to improve the classifier's
   accuracy. Moreover, a distance-based regional data set was generated to
   capture ozone transportation characteristics. The results show that a
   combination of preprocessing methods and ensemble algorithms can
   effectively forecast ozone threshold exceedances. Furthermore, this
   study advises on the relative importance of the different variables for
   ozone pollution prediction and confirms that regional data facilitate
   better forecasting. The results of this research can be promoted by the
   Hong Kong authorities for improving the existing forecasting tools.
   Moreover, the results can facilitate researchers' selection of the
   appropriate techniques in their future research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a driving assistant that makes recommendations
   in order to reduce the fuel consumption. The solution only requires a
   smartphone and an OBD/Bluetooth device. Eco-driving advices try to avoid
   situations that cause an increase in the fuel consumption such as
   inappropriate speed or slow reaction to the detection of traffic signs
   and traffic incidents. The main contribution of this paper is the use of
   artificial intelligence techniques in order to issue the eco-driving
   tips that are best adapted to the user profile, the characteristics of
   the vehicle, and the road state conditions. This is very important
   because the driver may lose the interest due to the high requirements
   that tend to be provided by general use eco-driving assistants. In order
   to properly assess and validate the proposed solution, it has been
   implemented on several Android mobile devices and has been validated
   using a dataset of 2,250 driving tests using three different models of
   vehicles with 25 different drivers on three distinct routes. The results
   show that the system reduces the fuel consumption by 11.04 percent on
   average and even, in certain cases, the fuel saving is greater than 15
   percent.}},

Title = {{Combining firefly algorithm and Bayesian classifier: new direction for

Journal = {{IET IMAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{763-772}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{As digital images are increasing exponentially; it is very attractive to
   develop more effective machine learning frameworks for automatic image
   annotation. In order to address the most prominent issues (huge
   inter-concept visual similarity and huge intra-concept visual diversity)
   more effectively, an inter-related non-parametric Bayesian classifier
   training framework to support multi-label image annotation is developed.
   For this purpose, an image is viewed as a bag, and its instances are the
   over-segmented regions within it found automatically with an adopted
   Otsu's method segmentation algorithm. Here firefly algorithm (FA) is
   utilised to enhance Otsu's method in the direction of finding optimal
   multilevel thresholds using the maximum variance intra-clusters. FA has
   high convergence speed and less computation rate as compared with some
   evolutionary algorithms. By generating blobs, the extracted features for
   segmented regions, the concepts which are learned by the classifier tend
   to relate textually to the words which occur most often in the data and
   visually to the easiest to recognise segments. This allowing the
   opportunity to assign a word to each object (localised labelling).
   Extensive experiments on Corel benchmark image datasets will validate
   the effectiveness of the proposed solution to multi-label image
   annotation and label ranking problem.}},

Abstract = {{Metaheuristic algorithms (MHs) have a long history that can be traced
   back to genetic algorithms and evolutionary computing in the 1950s.
   Since February 2008, with the birth of the Firefly algorithm, MHs
   started to receive attention from researchers around the globe. Variants
   and new species of MH algorithms have bloomed like sprouts after rain.
   However, the necessity for creating more new species of such algorithms
   is questionable. It can be observed that these algorithms are
   fundamentally made up of several widely used core components. By
   explaining these components, the underlying design for a collection of
   the so-called modern MH optimisation algorithms is revealed. In this
   paper, the core components in some of the more popular MH algorithms are
   reviewed, thereby debunking the myths of their novelty, and perhaps
   dampening claims that something really `new' is invented simply by
   branding an MH search method with the name of another living creature.
   Counterintuitive experimentations have shown that by taking snapshots,
   anyone can show some improvements of an MH over another in some
   situation. Mixing certain components up indeed adds advantage over the
   original MH. The same goes to extending MH with slight functional
   modification. This work also serves as a general guideline and a
   reference for any algorithm architect who wants to create a new MH
   algorithm in the future.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel optimization algorithm based on competitive
   behavior of various creatures such as birds, cats, bees and ants to
   survive in nature. In the proposed method, a competition is designed
   among all aforementioned creatures according to their performances.
   Every optimization algorithm can be appropriate for some objective
   functions and may not be appropriate for another. Due to the interaction
   between different optimization algorithms proposed in this paper, the
   algorithms acting based on the behavior of these creatures can compete
   each other for the best. The rules of competition between the
   optimization methods are based on imperialist competitive algorithm.
   Imperialist competitive algorithm decides which of the algorithms can
   survive and which of them must be extinct. In order to have a comparison
   to well-known heuristic global optimization methods, some simulations
   are carried out on some benchmark test functions with different and high
   dimensions. The obtained results shows that the proposed competition
   based optimization algorithm is an efficient method in finding the
   solution of optimization problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Incorporation of pathway knowledge into microarray analysis has brought
   better biological interpretation of the analysis outcome. However, most
   pathway data are manually curated without specific biological context.
   Non-informative genes could be included when the pathway data is used
   for analysis of context specific data like cancer microarray data.
   Therefore, efficient identification of informative genes is inevitable.
   Embedded methods like penalized classifiers have been used for
   microarray analysis due to their embedded gene selection. This paper
   proposes an improved penalized support vector machine with absolute
   t-test weighting scheme to identify informative genes and pathways.
   Experiments are done on four microarray data sets. The results are
   compared with previous methods using 10-fold cross validation in terms
   of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F-score. Our method shows
   consistent improvement over the previous methods and biological
   validation has been done to elucidate the relation of the selected genes
   and pathway with the phenotype under study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Relationships between information systems are very important topics in
   the field of artificial intelligence. The concept of homomorphisms is an
   effective mathematical tool to study relationships between information
   systems. A knowledge base is a special relation information system. This
   paper investigates invariant characteristics of knowledge bases under
   the homomorphism. The fact that knowledge bases themselves are invariant
   and inverse invariant under the homomorphism is firstly proved. Next,
   some invariant characteristics and inverse invariant characteristics
   under the homomorphism, such as the dependency of knowledge bases,
   knowledge reductions, coordinate families and necessary relations, are
   obtained based on this fact. Finally, lattice characteristics of the
   dependency of knowledge bases are given. These results will be
   significant for establishing a framework of granular computing in
   knowledge bases.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the practical limitations of the energy and processing
   capabilities, the deployment of many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is
   facing two main challenges of increasing network lifetime and reducing
   End to End Delay (EED) which become critical when the nodes are mobile
   and use non-rechargeable energy sources. One way to help to extend
   network lifetime is using fuzzy logic in a form of artificial
   intelligence. To this end we propose a new routing protocol for using
   mobile WSNs, which holds the nodes in an equal level of energy and
   decreases energy dissipation of the network. An optimum path is selected
   based on the cost of each node to increase network lifetime. In order to
   lessen EED, we also attempt to design a novel zoning-scheme for the
   network area. In this scheme, zonation is dynamic and works based on the
   Data Link (DL) position. The simulation result shows a significant
   improvement in lifetime and EED by proposed protocol compared with
   existing protocols. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the top cancer in women worldwide. Scientists are
   looking for early detection strategies which remain the cornerstone of
   breast cancer control. Consequently, there is a need to develop an

   successfully for diagnosing various diseases. However, little effort has
   been undertaken to improve its classification accuracy. To increase the
   classification accuracy, this study introduces a new hybrid system that
   incorporates support vector machine, fuzzy logic, and real tournament
   selection mechanism into AIRS. The Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set was
   used as the benchmark data set; it is available through the machine
   learning repository of the University of California at Irvine. The
   classification performance was measured through tenfold
   cross-validation, student's t test, sensitivity and specificity. With an
   accuracy of 100 \%, the proposed method was able to classify breast

   for time series stock market price prediction using a recurrent

   this approach is to use time series price momentum and time series
   prediction error adjusted to the well-known adaptive neuro-fuzzy
   inference system, ANFIS. Extended from ANFIS, the aim of this study is
   to propose a reliable prediction system with minimal error. Moreover, to
   evaluate the proposed model strength, four top-listed stocks from Dhaka
   stock exchange were applied. In the experiments, several choices of
   momentum from 3 to 20 days are selected for data preprocessing. It was
   found that the proposed RENFSM performed superiorly and was more

Pages = {{70-82}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Markov decision processes are a powerful framework for nonlinear,
   possibly stochastic optimal control. We consider two existing optimistic
   planning algorithms to solve them, which originate in artificial
   intelligence. These algorithms have provable near-optimal performance
   when the actions and possible stochastic next-states are discrete, but
   they wastefully discard the planning data after each step. We therefore
   introduce a method to learn online, from this data, the upper bounds
   that are used to guide the planning process. Five different
   approximators for the upper bounds are proposed, one of which is
   specifically adapted to planning, and the other four coming from the
   standard toolbox of function approximation. Our analysis characterizes
   the influence of the approximation error on the performance, and reveals
   that for small errors, learning-based planning performs better. In
   detailed experimental studies, learning leads to improved performance
   with all five representations, and a local variant of support vector
   machines provides a good compromise between performance and computation.

Title = {{Understanding effects of cognitive rehabilitation under a knowledge

Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},

Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{165-185}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and
   disability in children and young adults worldwide. Cognitive
   rehabilitation (CR) plans consist of a sequence of CR tasks targeting
   main cognitive functions. There is not enough on-field experience yet
   regarding which specific intervention (tasks or exercise assignment) is
   more appropriate to help therapists to design plans with significant
   effectiveness on patient improvement. The selection of specific tasks to
   be prescribed to the patient and the order in which they might be
   executed is currently decided by the therapists based on their
   experience.
   In this paper a new data mining methodology is proposed, combining
   several tools from Artificial Intelligence, clustering and
   post-processing analysis to identify regularities in the sequences of
   tasks in such a way that treatment profiles (classes) can be discovered.
   Due to the cumulative effect of rehabilitation tasks, small variations
   within the sequence of tasks performed by the patient do not
   significantly change the final outcomes in rehabilitation and makes it
   difficult to find discriminant rules by using the traditional machine
   learning inductive methods. However, by relaxing the formalization of
   the problem to find patterns that might include small variations, and
   introducing motif discovery techniques in the proposed methodology, the
   complexity of the neurorehabilitation phenomenon can be better captured
   and a global structure of successful treatment task sequences can be
   devised.
   Following this, the relationship between the discovered patterns and the
   CR treatment response are analyzed, offering a richer perspective than
   that provided by the single task focus traditionally used in the CR
   field.
   The paper provides a definition of the whole methodological approach
   proposed from a formal point of view, and its application to a real
   dataset. Comparisons with traditional AI approaches are also presented
   and the contribution of the proposed methodology to the Al field
   discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Cognitive spectrum management in dynamic cellular environments: A

Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{239-249}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines how novel cellular system architectures and
   intelligent spectrum management techniques can be used to play a key
   role in accommodating the exponentially increasing demand for mobile
   data capacity in the near future. A significant challenge faced by the
   artificial intelligence methods applied to such flexible wireless
   communication systems is their dynamic nature, e.g. network topologies
   that change over time. This paper proposes an intelligent case-based
   Q-learning method for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) which improves and
   stabilises the performance of cognitive cellular systems with dynamic
   topologies. The proposed approach is the combination of classical
   distributed Q-learning and a novel implementation of case-based
   reasoning which aims to facilitate a number of learning processes
   running in parallel. Large scale simulations of a stadium small cell
   network show that the proposed case-based Q-learning approach achieves a
   consistent improvement in the system quality of service (QoS) under
   dynamic and asymmetric network topology and traffic load conditions.
   Simulations of a secondary spectrum sharing scenario show that the
   cognitive cellular system that employs the proposed case-based
   Q-learning DSA scheme is able to accommodate a 28-fold increase in the
   total primary and secondary system throughput, but with no need for
   additional spectrum and with no degradation in the primary user QoS. (C)

Abstract = {{Multiple objects (targets) tracking plays an important role in computer
   vision. It is considered as the first step in many artificial
   intelligence applications that are developed to analyze people behavior
   for either security or statistical purposes. The most important
   challenge faced by algorithms designed for multiple objects tracking is
   the identity switches that occur between tracked objects due to
   occlusions and interactions between these same objects. This work falls
   within the scope of video-based behavioral marketing analysis and aims
   to better understand the purchasing behavior of customers by analyzing
   their movements in a densely-populated sales area. We propose to use a
   re-identification strategy to prevent these identity switches. This
   re-identification strategy is based on segmenting detected individuals
   into head, torso, and legs in addition to the classification of their
   appearances into front and back poses. This re-identification module is
   integrated within our tracking system to fuse tracklets obtained from a
   particle filter based tracking framework in a mono-camera tracking
   system. The combination of these tracking and re-identification modules
   allows the recovery of global trajectories for tracked individuals. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a memory-based version of gravitational search
   algorithm (MBGSA) to improve the beamforming performance by preventing
   loss of optimal trajectory. The conventional gravitational search
   algorithm (GSA) is a memory-less heuristic optimization algorithm based
   on Newton's laws of gravitation. Therefore, the positions of agents only
   depend on the optimal solutions of previous iteration. In GSA, there is
   always a chance to lose optimal trajectory because of not utilizing the
   best solution from previous iterations of the optimization process. This
   drawback reduces the performance of GSA when dealing with complicated
   optimization problems. However, the MBGSA uses the overall best solution
   of the agents from previous iterations in the calculation of agents'
   positions. Consequently, the agents try to improve their positions by
   always searching around overall best solutions. The performance of the
   MBGSA is evaluated by solving fourteen standard benchmark optimization
   problems and the results are compared with GSA and modified GSA (MGSA).
   It is also applied to adaptive beamforming problems to improve the
   weight vectors computed by Minimum Variance Distortionless Response
   (MVDR) algorithm as a real world optimization problem. The proposed
   algorithm demonstrates high performance of convergence compared to GSA
   and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{239}},
Pages = {{97-142}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The increasing presence of autonomous (software) systems in open
   environments in general, and the complex interactions taking place among
   them in particular, require flexible control and coordination mechanisms
   to guarantee desirable overall system level properties without limiting
   the autonomy of the involved systems. In artificial intelligence, and in
   particular in the multi-agent systems research field, social laws,
   norms, and sanctions have been widely proposed as flexible means for
   coordinating the behaviour of autonomous agents in multi-agent settings.
   Recently, many languages have been proposed to specify and implement
   norm-based environments where the behaviour of autonomous agents is
   monitored, evaluated based on norms, and possibly sanctioned if norms
   are violated.
   In this paper, we first introduce a formal setting of multi-agent
   environments based on concurrent game structures which abstracts from
   concrete specification languages. We extend this formal setting with
   norms and sanctions, and show how concepts from mechanism design can be
   used to formally analyse and verify whether a specific behaviour can be
   enforced (or implemented) if agents follow their subjective preferences.
   We relate concepts from mechanism design to our setting, where agents'
   preferences are modelled by linear time temporal logic (LTL) formulae.
   This proposal bridges the gap between norms and mechanism design
   allowing us to formally study and analyse the effect of norms and
   sanctions on the behaviour of rational agents. The proposed machinery
   can be used to check whether specific norms and sanctions have the
   designer's expected effect on the rational agents' behaviour or if a set
   of norms and sanctions that realise the effect exists at all. We
   investigate the computational complexity of our framework, focusing on
   its implementation in Nash equilibria and we show that it is located at
   the second and third level of the polynomial hierarchy. Despite this
   high complexity, on the positive side, these results are in line with
   existing complexity results of related problems. Finally, we propose a
   concrete executable specification language that can be used to implement
   multi agent environments. We show that the proposed specification
   language generates specific concurrent game structures and that the
   abstract multi-agent environment setting can be applied to study and
   analyse the behaviour of multi-agent programs with and without norms.

Abstract = {{The present study concerns the remote monitoring of immersed plate-like
   structures as the ones used for marine current turbines. The innovation
   of this work is the remote damage detection based on a systematic
   analysis of a small set of ultrasonic measurements limited by the
   backscattered echoes from the structure edges. The detection and
   localization are performed by combination of signal processing tools as
   Hilbert transform, principal component analysis, and thresholding
   methods and artificial intelligence tools as Gaussian neural networks.
   The edges of the structure are detected with a Gaussian neural network
   classifier, and the useful ranges of the measurements are extracted.
   These ranges are compared with reference signals in order to compute
   residuals. Finally damage detection is obtained from the magnitude of
   the residuals. In addition, some geometric parameters such as the
   incidence angle, the distance between the structure and the
   emission-reception device, and eventually the damage localization are
   estimated. The proposed method is validated with laboratory experimental
   measurements, and the performance is discussed with respect to some
   significant parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Accident prediction is one of the most critical aspects of road safety,
   whereby an accident can be predicted before it actually occurs and
   precautionary measures taken to avoid it. For this purpose, accident
   prediction models are popular in road safety analysis. Artificial

   where outcomes and data are not same all the time and are influenced by
   occurrence of random changes. This paper presents a study on the
   existing approaches for the detection of unsafe driving patterns of a
   vehicle used to predict accidents. The literature covered in this paper
   is from the past 10 years, from 2004 to 2014. AI techniques are surveyed
   for the detection of unsafe driving style and crash prediction. A number
   of statistical methods which are used to predict the accidents by using
   different vehicle and driving features are also covered in this paper.
   The approaches studied in this paper are compared in terms of datasets
   and prediction performance. We also provide a list of datasets and
   simulators available for the scientific community to conduct research in
   the subject domain. The paper also identifies some of the critical open

Abstract = {{Nowadays, power grid monitoring systems are shifting towards more
   disseminating and distributive operations. The diagnosis of faults using
   knowledge discovery techniques has become an essential component of the
   process, accounting to the challenges faced by the electrical power
   monitoring systems. The system's operators employ various energy
   management techniques which play important roles in the overall
   management, reliability and operational sustainability of smart grid
   utilities. Sometimes, these systems are disrupted by events like a short
   circuit in the system or any external incursion that could pose a threat
   to the public safety as well as to the critical infrastructure of the
   grid. This paper aims at providing a robust system for fault diagnosis
   using the status of an intelligent electronic device and circuit
   breakers which can be tripped by any kind of fault. To protect the
   system from vulnerabilities and different kinds of faults, a
   multilayered fault estimation classifier, based on the Dominance based
   rough set is proposed. This technique provides an effective solution to
   the system's operator for the proper diagnosis of the faults and
   intrusions by classifying the state of the system. In addition to this,
   the operator can take preventative measures to protect the system from
   further damage.}},

Abstract = {{Today, one of the most important and challenging issues in artificial
   intelligence is modeling human behavior in virtual environments.
   Furthermore, studying e-learning environments is in great demand in
   computer science which requires understanding human behaviors. Thus,
   considering human behavior factors, such as personality, mood, and
   emotion, and modeling them in e-learning environments is a challenging
   issue in artificial intelligence. The purpose of this paper is to review
   the psychological models of personality used in computer science. In
   addition, the most important applications of personality models and
   their direct related topics in learning, i.e. learning style issues in
   e-learning environments, are presented. The study shows that researchers
   tend to use models that are simple to implement in virtual world and are
   as comprehensive as possible to cover all the features of human
   behavior. Finally, we concluded that models such as the Five Factor
   Model, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personality model, and
   Felder-Silverman learning styles model have the two most important
   features, which are simplicity and comprehensiveness. These two features
   have made these psychology models the most favorable in the virtual

Abstract = {{Plans with loops are more general and compact than classical sequential

   few work has been devoted to the semantic foundations on planning with

   together with two semantics for handling domains with non-deterministic
   actions and loops. Then we propose a sound and (relative) complete
   Hoare-style proof system for efficient plan generation and verification
   under 0-approximation semantics, which uses the so-called idea offline
   planning and on-line querying strategy in knowledge compilation, i.e.,
   the agent could generate and store short proofs as many as possible in
   the spare time, and then perform quick query by constructing a long
   proof from the stored shorter proofs using compositional rule. We argue
   that both our semantics and proof system could serve as logical
   foundations for reasoning about actions with loops.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, cardiovascular diseases are very common and are one of the
   main causes of death worldwide. One major type of such diseases is the
   coronary artery disease (CAD). The best and most accurate method for the
   diagnosis of CAD is angiography, which has significant complications and
   costs. Researchers are, therefore, seeking novel modalities for CAD
   diagnosis via data mining methods. To that end, several algorithms and
   datasets have been developed. However, a few studies have considered the
   stenosis of each major coronary artery separately. We attempted to
   achieve a high rate of accuracy in the diagnosis of the stenosis of each
   major coronary artery. Analytical methods were used to investigate the
   importance of features on artery stenosis. Further, a proposed
   classification model was built to predict each artery status in new
   visitors. To further enhance the models, a proposed feature selection
   method was employed to select more discriminative feature subsets for
   each artery. According to the experiments, accuracy rates of 86.14\%,
   83.17\%, and 83.50\% were achieved for the diagnosis of the stenosis of
   the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, left circumflex (LCX) artery
   and right coronary artery (RCA), respectively. To the best of our
   knowledge, these are the highest accuracy rates that have been obtained
   in the literature so far. In addition, a number of rules with high
   confidence were introduced for deciding whether the arteries were
   stenotic or not. Also, we applied the proposed method on two challenging
   datasets and obtained the best accuracy in comparison with other
   methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Decision-making is a crucial step in vehicles' safety systems, which
   determines the right time for the system to intervene and to take the
   required action, depending on the current situation of the vehicle. The
   warning/intervention system becomes active when the driving situation
   considered unpleasant while still giving the control to the driver.
   Taking the action of warning, braking and determining the best time for
   this intervention are important decisions in collision mitigation
   systems. In this work, a novel system is designed based on artificial
   bee colony algorithm to enhance the decision-making in such systems.
   This work c oncentrates on collision mitigation by braking systems only,
   for front-to-rear accidents. This paper studies cases when the hosting
   vehicle approaches moving and stationary objects. This work is
   simulated, and the results are obtained and analyzed which proved the
   contribution to this work in reducing the collision speed and the

Abstract = {{While active learning method (ALM) uses error as the learning parameter,
   selection of the validation data is still challenging. In this paper, to
   prevent form encountering with sample size problem, we applied an
   error-independent version of ALM that we call the active fuzzy modeling
   (AFM) with a distance threshold to model parameters of hydrocarbon
   reservoirs. In this paper, we demonstrate that measuring the
   generalization error is a vital factor in the process of ALM. Regression
   (R) and mean squared error (MSE) for estimating RHOB by AFM were 0.96
   and 0.0032, respectively. On the other hand, R of 0.91, 0.89 and 0.92
   and MSE of 0.0051, 0.0067 and 0.0047 for ANN, TS-FIS and NF,
   respectively, illustrate that AFM performs much better in comparison
   with conventional modeling approaches and produces more reliable
   results. Comparing the results of the presented method with ANN, TS-FIS
   and NF in aspect of rapidity, robustness, storage, complexity and
   acceptability in estimating RHOB reports the accuracy and
   high-performance behavior of AFM. This method is illustrated by an

Abstract = {{Rock physical parameters such as porosity and water saturation play an
   important role in the mechanical behavior of hydrocarbon reservoir
   rocks. A valid and reliable prediction of these parameters from seismic
   data is essential for reservoir characterization, management, and also
   geomechanical modeling. In this paper, the application of conventional
   methods such as Bayesian inversion and computational intelligence
   methods, namely support vector regression (SVR) optimized by particle
   swarm optimization (PSO) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference
   system-subtractive clustering method (ANFIS-SCM), is demonstrated to
   predict porosity and water saturation. The prediction abilities offered
   by Bayesian inversion, SVR-PSO, and ANFIS-SCM were presented using a
   synthetic dataset and field data available from a gas carbonate
   reservoir in Iran. In these models, seismic pre-stack data and
   attributes were utilized as the input parameters, while the porosity and
   water saturation were the output parameters. Various statistical
   performance indexes were utilized to compare the performance of those
   estimation models. The results achieved indicate that the ANFIS-SCM
   model has strong potential for indirect estimation of porosity and water
   saturation with high degree of accuracy and robustness from seismic data
   and attributes in both synthetic and real cases of this study.}},

Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{38-54}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Pawlak's rough sets model describes an uncertain target set (concept)
   with two crisp boundary lines (i.e. lower and upper approximation sets)
   and as an effective tool has successfully been used to deal with
   uncertain information systems. Based on the rough sets model, a
   probabilistic rough sets model with a pair of thresholds was proposed to
   improve the fault-tolerance ability of rough sets. The uncertainty of
   Pawlak's rough sets model is rooted in the objects contained in the
   boundary region of the target concept, while the uncertainty of
   probabilistic rough sets model comes from three regions, because the
   objects in the positive or negative regions are probably uncertain, and
   the membership degrees of these objects are not necessary equal to 1 or
   0. In this paper, a method for measuring the uncertainty of
   probabilistic rough sets is proposed, and the change rules of
   uncertainty with changing knowledge spaces are presented and analyzed.
   Then, for an uncertain target concept, the uncertainties of the three
   regions are discussed, and the related change rules of uncertainty with
   changing knowledge spaces are revealed and successfully proved. Finally,
   a comparative analysis on the uncertainty of a target concept in rough
   sets and probabilistic rough sets model is presented. These results are
   important to further enrich and improve probabilistic rough sets theory,
   and effectively promote the development of uncertainty artificial

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the most frequently and world widely diagnosed
   life-threatening cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer death
   among women. Early accurate diagnosis can be a big plus in treating
   breast cancer. Researchers have approached this problem using various
   data mining and machine learning techniques such as support vector
   machine, artificial neural network, etc. The computer immunology is also
   an intelligent method inspired by biological immune system, which has
   been successfully applied in pattern recognition, combination
   optimization, machine learning, etc. However, most of these diagnosis
   methods belong to a supervised diagnosis method. It is very expensive to
   obtain labeled data in biology and medicine. In this paper, we
   seamlessly integrate the state-of-the-art research on life science with
   artificial intelligence, and propose a semi-supervised learning
   algorithm to reduce the need for labeled data. We use two well-known
   benchmark breast cancer datasets in our study, which are acquired from
   the UCI machine learning repository. Extensive experiments are conducted
   and evaluated on those two datasets. Our experimental results
   demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm,
   which proves that our algorithm is a promising automatic diagnosis

Abstract = {{Flood forecasting in natural rivers is a complicated procedure because
   of uncertainties involved in the behaviour of the flood wave movement.
   This leads to complex problems in hydrological modelling which have been
   widely solved by soft computing techniques. In real time flood
   forecasting, data generation is continuous and hence there is a need to
   update the developed mapping equation frequently which increases the
   computational burden. In short term flood forecasting where the accuracy
   of flood peak value and time to peak are critical, frequent model
   updating is unavoidable. In this paper, we studied a new technique:
   Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) which is capable of
   updating the model equation based on new data entry without much
   increase in computational cost. The OS-ELM was explored for use in flood
   forecasting on the Neckar River, Germany. The reach was characterized by
   significant lateral flow that affected the flood wave formation. Hourly
   data from 1999-2000 at the upstream section of Rottweil were used to
   forecast flooding at the Oberndorf downstream site with a lead time of
   1-6 h. Model performance was assessed by using three evaluation
   measures: the coefficient of determination (R-2), the Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency coefficient (NS) and the root mean squared error (RMSE). The
   performance of the OS-ELM was comparable to those of other widely used
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques like support vector machines
   (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Genetic Programming (GP).
   The frequent updating of the model in OS-ELM gave a closer reproduction
   of flood events and peak values with minimum error compared to SVM, ANN
   and GP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of all power system state estimation (PSSE) is to
   determine, by statistical projections, the best estimate of state
   variables represented by the voltage magnitudes and voltage angles of
   all the buses. Due to the complexity and non-linearity of the power
   system (PS), it is necessary to use more advanced methods for its
   analysis and control in real-time environment. This research discusses
   the application and the comparison of hybrid models of one of the
   algorithm using artificial intelligence (AI) technique (particle swarm
   optimisation `PSO') in minimising the raw measurement errors in order to
   estimate the optimal point of the PS when certain sensitive data are
   incomplete. The effectiveness of the hybrid models are demonstrated and
   compared with the original PSO, artificial bee swarm optimisation (ABSO)
   algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) using IEEE 14, 30, 118 and 300 bus
   test systems. Newton-Raphson load flow solution is taken as benchmark.
   Two different objective function formulations assessed by PSWV (Particle
   swarm without velocity equation), EPSOWP (Enhanced particle swarm
   optimiser incorporating a weighted particle), PSO-RF (PSO with repulsion
   factor) and CLPSO (Comprehensive learning PSO). The first formulation is
   the Weighted Least Square (WLS) and the second one is the Weighted Least
   Absolute Value (WLAV). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Irresponsible and negligent use of natural resources in the last five
   decades has made it an important priority to adopt more intelligent ways
   of managing existing resources, especially the ones related to energy.
   The main objective of this paper is to explore the opportunities of
   integrating internal data already stored in Data Warehouses together
   with external Big Data to improve energy consumption predictions. This
   paper presents a study in which we propose an architecture that makes
   use of already stored energy data and external unstructured information
   to improve knowledge acquisition and allow managers to make better
   decisions. This external knowledge is represented by a torrent of
   information that, in many cases, is hidden across heterogeneous and
   unstructured data sources, which are recuperated by an Information
   Extraction system. Alternatively, it is present in social networks
   expressed as user opinions. Furthermore, our approach applies data
   mining techniques to exploit the already integrated data. Our approach
   has been applied to a real case study and shows promising results. The
   experiments carried out in this work are twofold: (i) using and
   comparing diverse Artificial Intelligence methods, and (ii) validating
   our approach with data sources integration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{An adaptive random walk sampling method on dynamic community detection}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{10-19}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{With the change of lifestyle and interests, the people's social
   activities have a dynamic changing tendency. Therefore, the static
   community could not reflect the real activities. For the `community' in
   the social network is the aggregate of people's activities, thus the
   dynamic community could be detected by simulating the individual
   freewill. The individual tends to get in touch with the closest friends.
   By that a direction from one node to its closest nodes can be obtained,
   and the formed directed network could easily find out the communities.
   It is different from the traditional community detection policies, which
   only consider the global topological structure of the social network.
   Accord to the theory above, we designed the RWS (Random Walk Sampling)
   method to detect the overlapping communities, utilizing the random walk
   method to find the closest friends for each node. As the topological
   structure changing, the proposed ARWS (Adaptive Random Walk Sampling)
   could make the impacted nodes find out the new closest friends and the
   changed communities adaptively. The ARWS only update the impacted nodes
   and communities as the dynamic events occurring, while the traditional
   dynamic community detection methods need to break up and restructure the
   communities after the topology changing, because the tradition methods
   are based on the global topological structure. Therefore, the ARWS has a
   lower cost than the traditional methods. Furthermore, the ARWS focus on
   the individual, fitting to the decentralized computing framework, such
   as distributed computation and cloud computing. That is the trend of the
   artificial intelligence. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},

Volume = {{58}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Bankruptcy prediction has been a subject of interests for almost a
   century and it still ranks high among hottest topics in economics. The
   aim of predicting financial distress is to develop a predictive model
   that combines various econometric measures and allows to foresee a
   financial condition of a firm. In this domain various methods were
   proposed that were based on statistical hypothesis testing, statistical
   modeling (e.g., generalized linear models), and recently artificial
   intelligence (e.g., neural networks, Support Vector Machines, decision
   tress). In this paper, we propose a novel approach for bankruptcy
   prediction that utilizes Extreme Gradient Boosting for learning an
   ensemble of decision trees. Additionally, in order to reflect
   higher-order statistics in data and impose a prior knowledge about data
   representation, we introduce a new concept that we refer as to synthetic
   features. A synthetic feature is a combination of the econometric
   measures using arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,
   multiplication, division). Each synthetic feature can be seen as a
   single regression model that is developed in an evolutionary manner. We
   evaluate our solution using the collected data about Polish companies in
   five tasks corresponding to the bankruptcy prediction in the 1st, 2nd,
   3rd, 4th, and 5th year. We compare our approach with the reference
   methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an innovative data-driven non-linear dynamical system
   modelling method, ALS-SVR-ARMA(2K), is proposed for a high consistency
   refining (HCR) process in papermaking to online estimate the freeness
   index. First, to completely capture the non-linear dynamics of the
   process, the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is constructed
   by modelling system output as a non-linear dynamical function of the
   past system inputs (moving average) and past system output
   (autoregression). Then, the non-parametric kernel learning method, least
   squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), is presented for learning of
   the ARMA model. Moreover, to increase the modelling accuracy and make
   the model has both good interpolation and extrapolation abilities,
   improvements of multi-kernel learning and adaptive output regulation are
   implemented. Finally, to further enhance the modelling accuracy and
   efficiency of the constructed ALS-SVR-ARMA(2K) model, the adaptive
   mutation particle swarm optimisation (AMPSO) is proposed to optimise the
   hybrid model parameters. Industrial experiments and comparative studies
   have been carried out on an industrial HCR process, where it has been
   demonstrated that the developed AMPSO-ALS-SVR-ARMA(2K) model produces a
   better modelling accuracy, stronger generalisation capability and
   sparsity, and faster learning speed than the other methods. Moreover,
   these superiorities are especially true in the case of small samples.}},

Abstract = {{As an efficient solution to diversify the future Internet for resource
   sharing in data centers, the network virtualization enables seamless
   integration of network experiments, services and architectures with
   different features by allowing multiple heterogeneous virtual networks
   (VNs) to simultaneously coexist on a shared substrate infrastructure.
   Embedding multiple virtual networks onto a shared substrate by
   allocating substrate resources to virtual nodes and virtual links of VN
   requests under a collection of constrains is known to be an NP-hard
   problem even for the offline VN embedding. To deal with this issue, this
   paper formulates the VN embedding problem as a new multiple objective
   linear programming optimization program, and solves it in a preemptive
   strategy by decomposing the problem into node mapping and link mapping
   phases. Furthermore, based on an Artificial Intelligence resource
   abstraction model, named Blocking Island (BI), we propose an efficient
   online heuristic VN embedding algorithm called Presto. Presto operates
   with quite low computation complexity and greatly reduces the search
   space, which far outperforms other candidates. The goal of Presto is to
   maximize the economic revenue of infrastructure providers while
   minimizing the embedding cost. The extensive simulation results further
   prove the feasibility and good performance of Presto in revenue, VN
   request acceptance ratio, computation efficiency and resource
   utilization. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in artificial intelligence has been the development of
   autonomous agents (AAs) capable of displaying believable behaviors. To
   achieve such objective, the underlying architectures of these
   intelligent systems have been designed to incorporate Learning
   Classifier System that provides an adaptation naturally with the
   environment. It is expected that through the interaction of this type of
   components, AAs can implement more intelligent and believable behavior.
   Although the literature reports several computational models of
   behaviors, attention, and emotions developed to be included in cognitive
   agent architectures, these have been implemented as separated processes,
   disregarding essential interactions between these behaviors whose
   modeling and computational implementation may increase the believability
   of actions developed by AAs. In this paper, we propose an evolutive
   computational model. This model is designed to provide AAs with adequate

Abstract = {{Computers and artificial intelligence have penetrated in the food
   industry since last decade, for intellectual automatic processing and
   packaging in general, and in assisting for quality inspection of the
   food itself in particular. The food quality assessment task becomes more
   challenging when it is about harmless internal examination of the
   ingredient, and even more when its size is also minute. In this article,
   a method for automatic detection, extraction and classification of raw
   food item is presented using x-ray image data of pine nuts. Image
   processing techniques are employed in developing an efficient method for
   automatic detection and then extraction of individual ingredient, from
   the source x-ray image which comprises bunch of nuts in a single frame.
   For data representation, statistical texture analysis is carried out and
   attributes are calculated from each of the sample image on the global
   level as features. In addition co-occurrence matrices are computed from
   images with four different offsets, and hence more features are
   extracted by using them. To find fewer meaningful characteristics, all
   the calculated features are organized in several combinations and then
   tested. Seventy percent of image data is used for training and 15\% each
   for cross-validation and test purposes. Binary classification is
   performed using two state-of-the-art non-linear classifiers: Artificial
   Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Performance is
   evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, specificity and
   sensitivity. ANN classifier showed 87.6\% accuracy with correct
   recognition rate of healthy nuts and unhealthy nuts as 94\% and 62\%
   respectively. SVM classifier produced the similar accuracy achieving
   86.3\% specificity and 89.2\% sensitivity rate. The results obtained are
   unique itself in terms of ingredient and promising relatively. It is
   also found that feature set size can be reduced up to 57\% by
   compromising 3.5\% accuracy, in combination with any of the tested
   classifiers.}},

Abstract = {{In Electronic Marketplaces (EMs), a number of unknown entities can
   interact to conclude purchase actions. Interactions are, usually,
   between buyers and sellers. Both groups of entities (e.g., buyers,
   sellers) aim to acquire items in the most profitable price. The
   discussed interactions are realized in the form of negotiations over a
   number of items characteristics. In this paper, we focus on the buyer
   side and deal with automated multi-issue concurrent negotiations. Such
   negotiations are between buyers and multiple sellers having in their
   property specific items. Each buyer negotiates with a number of sellers
   trying to achieve the most profitable value for a number of items'
   characteristics. We propose an optimization model for achieving the
   maximum possible utility. Our method adopts the principles of the
   Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm that offers a number of advantages
   compared to other Swarm Intelligence (SI) methods (e.g., Particle Swarm
   Optimization - PSO). The buyer, based on a number of threads, tries to
   find the optimal agreement when negotiating with a group of sellers.
   Every agreement, realized with a specific seller, results a utility for
   the buyer concluded over a weighted scheme on the items characteristics.
   Each thread adopts a weights adaptation model for optimizing the
   utility. A set of experiments reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the
   proposed model. We also report on a comparison assessment between the
   proposed method and other efforts found in the respective literature.

Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The increasing levels of criminal media being shared in peer-to-peer
   (P2P) networks pose a significant challenge to law enforcement agencies.
   One of the main priorities for P2P investigators is to identify cases
   where a user is actively engaged in the production of child sexual abuse
   (CSA) media - they can be indicators of recent or on-going child abuse.
   Although a number of P2P monitoring tools exist to detect paedophile
   activity in such networks, they typically rely on hash value databases
   of known CSA media. As a result, these tools are not able to adequately
   triage the thousands of results they retrieve, nor can they identify new
   child abuse media that are being released on to a network. In this
   paper, we present a new intelligent forensics approach that incorporates
   the advantages of artificial intelligence and machine learning theory to
   automatically flag new/previously unseen CSA media to investigators.
   Additionally, the research was extensively discussed with law
   enforcement cybercrime specialists from different European countries and
   Interpol. The approach has been implemented into the iCOP toolkit, a
   software package that is designed to perform live forensic analysis on a
   P2P network environment. In addition, the system offers secondary
   features, such as showing on-line sharers of known CSA files and the
   ability to see other files shared by the same GUID or other IP addresses
   used by the same P2P client. Finally, our evaluation on real CSA case
   data shows high degrees of accuracy, while hands-on trials with law
   enforcement officers demonstrate the toolkit's complementarity to extant
   investigative workflows. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{INFORMATION}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization ( TLBO) algorithm has been
   proposed in recent years. It is a new swarm intelligence optimization
   algorithm simulating the teaching-learning phenomenon of a classroom. In
   this paper, a novel global path planning method for mobile robots is
   presented, which is based on an improved TLBO algorithm called Nonlinear
   Inertia Weighted Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization ( NIWTLBO)
   algorithm in our previous work. Firstly, the NIWTLBO algorithm is
   introduced. Then, a new map model of the path between start-point and
   goal-point is built by coordinate system transformation. Lastly,
   utilizing the NIWTLBO algorithm, the objective function of the path is
   optimized; thus, a global optimal path is obtained. The simulation
   experiment results show that the proposed method has a faster
   convergence rate and higher accuracy in searching for the path than the
   basic TLBO and some other algorithms as well, and it can effectively
   solve the optimization problem for mobile robot global path planning.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Although lots of ways can be used to estimate geo-stress state,
   estimation of geo-stress state without knowing geomechanical parameters
   such as pore pressure, tensile strength and Poisson's ratio, etc., still
   remains one of the most challenging tasks in geotechnical engineering.
   The main contribution of this paper is to present a back-propagation
   neural network (BPNN) with genetic algorithm (GA) optimization to
   predict the geo-stresses based on wellbore pressures of hydraulic
   fracturing tests during drilling. In the suggested hybrid model, the
   BPNN is used establish a mapping between the recording pressures and the
   geo-stress state. Also the GA is used to carry out the optimization of
   the weights and thresholds of BPNN model for improving accuracy of
   prediction. Finally, based on the record pressures in hydraulic
   fracturing (HF) tests, the BPNN model with genetic algorithm
   optimization successfully predicts the geo-stresses at the corresponding
   formation in the event that these parameters such as pore pressure,
   tensile strength and Poisson's ratio are unavailable. In the meantime,
   the geo-stress state has been calculated using the theoretical formula
   by assuming pore pressure and tensile strength of rock mass are known.
   Then results from theoretical equation, BPNN and BPNN with GA
   optimization are compared, which shows that the degree accuracy of
   geo-stresses predicted by using GA-BPNN model is more obviously
   improvement than the predicted results by the basic BPNN model.}},

Title = {{META-GLARE: A meta-system for defining your own computer interpretable
   guideline system-Architecture and acquisition}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{22-41}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Context: Several different computer-assisted management systems of
   computer interpretable guidelines (CIGs) have been developed by the
   Artificial Intelligence in Medicine community. Each CIG system is
   characterized by a specific formalism to represent CIGs, and usually
   provides a manager to acquire, consult and execute them. Though there
   are several commonalities between most formalisms in the literature,
   each formalism has its own peculiarities.
   Objective: The goal of our work is to provide a flexible support to the
   extension or definition of CIGs formalisms, and of their acquisition and
   execution engines. Instead of defining ``yet another CIG formalism and
   its manager{''}, we propose META-GLARE (META Guideline Acquisition,
   Representation, and Execution), a ``meta{''}-system to define new CIG
   systems.
   Method and materials: In this paper, META-GLARE, a meta-system to define
   new CIG systems, is presented. We try to capture the commonalities among
   current CIG approaches, by providing (i) a general manager for the
   acquisition, consultation and execution of hierarchical graphs
   (representing the control flow of actions in CIGs), parameterized over
   the types of nodes and of arcs constituting it, and (ii) a library of
   different elementary components of guidelines nodes (actions) and arcs,
   in which each type definition involves the specification of how objects
   of this type can be acquired, consulted and executed. We provide
   generality and flexibility, by allowing free aggregations of such
   elementary components to define new primitive node and arc types.
   Results: We have drawn several experiments, in which we have used
   META-GLARE to build a CIG system (Experiment 1 in Section 8), or to
   extend it (Experiments 2 and 3). Such experiments show that META GLARE
   provides a useful and easy-to-use support to such tasks. For instance,
   re-building the Guideline Acquisition, Representation, and Execution
   (GLARE) system using META-GLARE required less than one day (Experiment
   1).
   Conclusions: META-GLARE is a meta-system for CIGs supporting fast
   prototyping. Since META-GLARE provides acquisition and execution engines
   that are parametric over the specific CIG formalism, it supports easy
   update and construction of CIG systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Transportation and distribution systems are improving with an increasing
   pace with the help of current technological facilities and additionally,
   the complexity of those systems are increasing. Vehicle Routing Problems
   (VRPs) are difficult to solve with conventional techniques. Improving
   routes used in distribution systems provides significant savings in
   terms of time and costs. In this paper, current routes in school buses,
   which is a sub-branch of vehicle routing problems, are optimized using
   the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), which is a heuristic artificial
   intelligence algorithm. Developed software is used for recommending the
   most suitable and the shortest route illustrated on a map by taking the
   instantaneous student wait locations online. Results of this study
   suggest that the current routes can be improved by using the ACO.}},

Abstract = {{Hybridization of the Sliding Mode Control schemes and the Artificial
   Intelligence techniques is a relatively new way in the control research
   domain. This paper proposes a robust control scheme by the adoption of
   Non-singular Terminal Sliding Mode Control (NTSMC), Higher Order Sliding
   Mode (HOSM) and Neural Network (NN) structure for n-DOF robotic
   manipulator. The NTSMC is used with Time Delay Estimation (TDE) method
   where the equivalent control term is synthesized without requirement of
   the robot model. In order to overcome the chattering drawback of the
   NTSMC, the discontinuous term is replaced by an adaptive HOSM
   controller. The adaptive HOSM controller consists of the Super Twisting
   algorithm (STW) which is estimated adaptively using Radial Based
   Function Neural Network (RBFNN) structure. The used RBFNN is learned
   online without requirement of a prior knowledge of training data. The
   stability is proved using a candidate Lyapunov function and the
   controller parameters are adjusted adaptively. The superiority and the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach are tested with a Three Degree of
   Freedom (3-DOF) Robot Manipulator (RM) in trajectory tracking task and
   compared with STW.}},

Abstract = {{In commercial poultry production there are a number of diseases which
   are of particular importance due to the heavy economic losses that can
   arise if a flock becomes infected. The development of an automated and
   rapid disease detection system would therefore be of considerable
   benefit to both production and animal welfare. This study represents an
   intelligence device for diagnosing avian diseases by using Data-mining
   methods and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (D-S). 14-day-old chickens
   were divided into four groups. Each group was deliberately infected with
   a disease: Newcastle Disease (ND), Bronchitis Virus (BV), Avian
   Influenenza (AI), and the last group was considered as control samples.
   Fast Fourier Transform (FFf) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) were
   used to process the chicken's sound signals in frequency and
   time-frequency domains, respectively. In order to achieve information,
   25 statistical features from frequency domains, and 75 statistical
   features from time-frequency domains were extracted. During
   dimensionality reduction stage, the best features of the sound signals
   were selected, using improved distance evaluation (IDE) method. The
   chicken's sound signals were analyzed in two consecutive days after
   virus infection. Support vector machine (SVM) was used as the classifier
   in this study. The first classification was done with SVM and based on
   sound features in frequency and time-frequency domains with accuracy of
   41.35 and 83.33\%, respectively. The accuracy of the method based on D-S
   infusion of sound data reached 91.15\%. The developed model based on
   achievement result could diagnose Newcastle Disease, Bronchitis Virus
   and Avian Influenza from sound signals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to examine the potential value of using
   machine learning techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN)
   schemes for the noninvasive estimation, at 11-13 weeks of gestation, the
   risk for euploidy, trisomy 21 (T21), and other chromosomal aneuploidies
   (O.C.A.), from suitable sonographic, biochemical markers, and other
   relevant data. A database(1) consisted of 51,208 singleton pregnancy
   cases, while undergoing first trimester screening for aneuploidies has
   been used for the building, training, and verification of the proposed
   method. From all the data collected for each case from the mother and
   the fetus, the following 9 are considered by the collaborating
   obstetricians as the most relevant to the problem in question: maternal
   age, previous pregnancy with T21, fetal crown-rump length, serum free
   beta-hCG in multiples of the median (MoM), pregnancy-associated plasma
   protein-A in MoM, nuchal translucency thickness, nasal bone, tricuspid
   flow, and ductus venosus flow. The dataset was randomly divided into a
   training set that was used to guide the development of various ANN
   schemes, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbor models. An
   evaluation set used to determine the performance of the developed
   systems. The evaluation set, totally unknown to the proposed system,
   contained 16,898 cases of euploidy fetuses, 129 cases of T21, and 76
   cases of O.C.A. The best results were obtained by the ANN system, which
   identified correctly all T21 cases, i.e., 0\% false negative rate (FNR)
   and 96.1\% of euploidies, i.e., 3.9\% false positive rate (FPR), meaning
   that no child would have been born with T21 if only that 3.9\% of all
   pregnancies had been sent for invasive testing. The aim of this work is
   to produce a practical tool for the obstetrician which will ideally
   provide 0\% FNR and to recommend the minimum possible number of cases
   for further testing such as invasive. In conclusion, it was demonstrated
   that ANN schemes can provide an effective early screening for fetal
   aneuploidies at a low FPR with results that compare favorably to those
   of existing systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the framework, rules, games, controllers, and
   results of the first General Video Game Playing Competition, held at the
   IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games in 2014. The
   competition proposes the challenge of creating controllers for general
   video game play, where a single agent must be able to play many
   different games, some of them unknown to the participants at the time of
   submitting their entries. This test can be seen as an approximation of
   general artificial intelligence, as the amount of game-dependent
   heuristics needs to be severely limited. The games employed are
   stochastic real-time scenarios (where the time budget to provide the
   next action is measured in milliseconds) with different winning
   conditions, scoring mechanisms, sprite types, and available actions for
   the player. It is a responsibility of the agents to discover the
   mechanics of each game, the requirements to obtain a high score and the
   requisites to finally achieve victory. This paper describes all
   controllers submitted to the competition, with an in-depth description
   of four of them by their authors, including the winner and the runner-up
   entries of the contest. The paper also analyzes the performance of the
   different approaches submitted, and finally proposes future tracks for
   the competition.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a popular approach for tree search in
   a variety of games. While MCTS allows for fine-grained time control, not
   much has been published on time management for MCTS programs under
   tournament conditions. This paper first investigates the effects of
   various time-management strategies on playing strength in the
   challenging game of Go. A number of domain-independent strategies are
   then tested in the domains Connect-4, Breakthrough, Othello, and Catch
   the Lion. We consider strategies taken from the literature as well as
   newly proposed and improved ones. Strategies include both semi-dynamic
   strategies that decide about time allocation for each search before it
   is started, and dynamic strategies that influence the duration of each
   move search while it is already running. Furthermore, we analyze the
   effects of time management strategies on the distribution of time over
   the moves of an average game, allowing us to partly explain their
   performance. In the experiments, the domain-independent strategy STOP
   provides a significant improvement over the state of the art in Go, and
   is the most effective time management strategy tested in all five
   domains.}},

Abstract = {{The gathering of real-world data is facilitated by many pervasive data
   sources such as sensor devices and smart-phones. The abundance of the
   sensory data raises the need to make the data easily available and
   understandable for the potential users and applications. Using semantic
   enhancements is one approach to structure and organize the data and to
   make it processable and interoperable by machines. In particular,
   ontologies are used to represent information and their relations in
   machine interpretable forms. In this context, a significant amount of
   work has been done to create real-world data description ontologies and
   data description models; however, little effort has been done in
   creating and constructing meaningful topical ontologies from a vast
   amount of sensory data by automated processes. Topical ontologies
   represent the knowledge from a certain domain providing a basic
   understanding of the concepts that serve as building blocks for further
   processing. There is a lack of solution that construct the structure and
   relations of ontologies based on real-world data. To address this
   challenge, we introduce a knowledge acquisition method that processes
   real-world data to automatically create and evolve topical ontologies
   based on rules that are automatically extracted from external sources.
   We use an extended k-means clustering method and apply a statistic model
   to extract and link relevant concepts from the raw sensor data and
   represent them in the form of a topical ontology. We use a rule-based
   system to label the concepts and make them understandable for the human
   user or semantic analysis and reasoning tools and software. The
   evaluation of our work shows that the construction of a topological
   ontology from raw sensor data is achievable with only small construction
   errors.}},

Abstract = {{The existing attribute-based zero-shot learning models at different
   levels ignore some necessary prior knowledge. It is essential to improve
   classification accuracy of zero-shot learning that how to mine
   attribute-related and class-related prior knowledge further being
   incorporated into the attribute prediction models. For the mining of
   class-related prior knowledge, measurement of the class-class
   correlation by using whitened cosine similarity is proposed. Likewise
   for the mining of attribute-related prior knowledge, measurements of the
   attribute-class and attribute-attribute correlation are proposed by
   using sparse representation coefficient. Therefore, a novel indirect
   attribute prediction (IAP) model is presented by exploiting
   class-related and attribute-related prior knowledge (IAP\_CAPK).
   Experimental results on animals with attributes and a-Pascal/a-Yahoo
   datasets show that, when compared with IAP and direct attribute
   prediction, the proposed IAP\_CAPK not only yields more accurate
   attribute prediction and zero-shot image classification, but also
   achieves much higher computational efficiency.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Representation-based face-recognition techniques have received attention
   in the field of pattern recognition in recent years; however, the
   well-known works focus mainly on constraint conditions and dictionary
   learning. Few researchers study, which sample data features determine
   the performance of representation-based classification algorithms. To
   address this problem, the authors define the structure-scatter degree,
   which represents the structural features of training sample sets, to
   determine whether a set is suitable for the representation-based
   classification algorithm. Experimental results show that sets with a
   higher structure scatter more likely allows a classification algorithm
   to obtain a higher recognition rate. Further, the block contribution
   degree (DBC) of a training sample set is defined to evaluate whether a
   sample set is suitable for block-based sparse-representation
   classification algorithms. Experimental results indicate that if the DBC
   approaches zero, the block technique is unlikely to improve the
   performance of a representation-based classification algorithm. Thus,
   they devise a self-adaptive optimisation method to generate an optimal
   block size, an overlapping degree, and a block-weighting scheme.
   Finally, they propose the structure scatter-based subclass
   representation classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed algorithm not only improves the recognition accuracy of the
   representation-based classification algorithm, but also greatly reduces
   its time complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Template tracking has been extensively investigated in computer vision
   to track objects for various applications. Tracking based on gradient
   descent algorithm using image gradient is one of the most popular object
   tracking method. However, it is difficult to define the relationship
   between the observed data set and the warping function due to the
   unobserved heterogeneity of the data set which inevitably results in
   poor tracking performance. This study proposes a novel method based on
   hierarchical mixture of expert to perform robust, real-time tracking
   from stationary cameras. By extending the idea of hyperplane
   approximation, the proposed approach establishes a hierarchical mixture
   of generalised linear regression model instead of a single model which
   reduces the non-linear error. The experiments' results show significant

Abstract = {{Heuristic search is one of the fundamental problem solving techniques in
   artificial intelligence, which is used in general to efficiently solve
   computationally hard problems in various domains, especially in planning
   and optimization. In this paper, we present an anytime heuristic search
   algorithm called anytime pack search (APS) which produces good quality
   solutions quickly and improves upon them over time, by focusing the
   exploration on a limited set of most promising nodes in each iteration.
   We discuss the theoretical properties of APS and show that it is
   complete. We also present the complexity analysis of the proposed
   algorithm on a tree state-space model and show that it is asymptotically
   of the same order as that of A{*}, which is a widely applied best-first
   search method. Furthermore, we present a parallel formulation of the
   proposed algorithm, called parallel anytime pack search (PAPS), which is
   applicable for searching tree state-spaces. We theoretically prove the
   completeness of PAPS. Experimental results on the sliding-tile puzzle
   problem, traveling salesperson problem, and single machine scheduling
   problem depict that the proposed sequential algorithm produces much
   better anytime performance when compared to some of the existing
   methods. Also, the proposed parallel formulation achieves super-linear

Abstract = {{Do the increasingly popular 3D movies change how we perceive the content
   of the movie? We presented short (3.21 min) film sequences to observers
   equipped with shutter glasses. Three genres (horror, action, and
   documentary) were crossed with three between-subjects viewing conditions
   (director's 3D, artificial 3D, and 2D). Observers had to rate how the
   film impressed them in terms of arousal, motion sickness, presence, and
   immersion. They also judged the personality, attractiveness, and
   intelligence of the protagonist in all viewing conditions. Not
   surprisingly, horror films produced more arousal and presence than
   action films. Documentaries scored lowest on presence. Action movies
   produced the highest immersion ratings. 2D viewing tended to produce
   less presence than 3D viewing. Surprisingly, artificial 3D was
   indistinguishable in terms of presence from the director's 3D. The same
   was true for motion sickness: 3D viewing, regardless whether intended by
   the director or introduced artificially, was more nauseating than 2D
   viewing. We also found a genre effect regarding the impression of the
   protagonist, the latter was more agreeable in documentaries presented in
   2D. The same protagonist was judged to be less extroverted and weighing
   more when viewed in director's 3D. We conclude that 3D film has complex
   effects that interact with the film genre. Directors should consider
   these interactions when planning to produce a 3D movie. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) gradient descent algorithm is used
   extensively for the training of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in the
   literature, despite its limitations, such as susceptibility to the local
   minima that undermine its robustness. In this paper, a bio-inspired
   algorithm referring to the Bat algorithm was proposed for training the
   ANN, to deviate from the limitations of the LM. The proposed Bat
   algorithm-based LM (BALM) was simulated on 10 benchmark datasets. For
   evaluation of the proposed BALM, comparative simulation experiments were
   conducted. The experimental results indicated that the BALM was found to
   deviate from the limitations of the LM to advance the accuracy and
   convergence speed of the ANN. Also, the BALM performs better than the
   back-propagation algorithm, artificial bee colony trained
   back-propagation ANN, and artificial bee colony trained LM ANN. The
   results of this research provide an alternative ANN training algorithm
   that can be used by researchers and industries to solve complex
   real-world problems across numerous domains of applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an image watermarking technique which exploits the
   human visual system (HVS), two artificial intelligence techniques
   {[}fuzzy inference system (FIS) and back propagation neural networks
   (BPNN)], and discrete cosine transform. The integration of FIS and BPNN
   results in a hybrid intelligence technique named neuro-fuzzy system,
   which combines the advantages of both the techniques. This system uses
   HVS model for calculating the weighing factor by giving the HVS
   parameters as inputs to the FIS and BPNN. The computed weighing value is
   used for embedding the watermark with maximum energy and
   imperceptibility. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed
   algorithm makes the watermark invisible and robust against numerous
   watermarking attacks including low-pass filtering, median filtering,
   rotation, JPEG compression, row-column copying, row-column blanking,
   image blurring, etc. Performance metrics used for comparison are peak
   signal-to-noise ratio and normalized cross correlation.}},

Abstract = {{There are many scenarios in artificial intelligence, signal processing
   or medicine, in which a temporal sequence consists of several unknown
   overlapping independent causes, and we are interested in accurately
   recovering those canonical causes. Factorial hidden Markov models
   (FHMMs) present the versatility to provide a good fit to these
   scenarios. However, in some scenarios, the number of causes or the
   number of states of the FHMM cannot be known or limited a priori. In
   this paper, we propose an infinite factorial unbounded-state hidden
   Markov model (IFUHMM), in which the number of parallel hidden Markov
   models (HMMs) and states in each HMM are potentially unbounded. We rely
   on a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) prior over integer-valued matrices, in
   which the columns represent the Markov chains, the rows the time
   indexes, and the integers the state for each chain and time instant.
   First, we extend the existent infinite factorial binary-state HMM to
   allow for any number of states. Then, we modify this model to allow for
   an unbounded number of states and derive an MCMC-based inference
   algorithm that properly deals with the trade-off between the unbounded
   number of states and chains. We illustrate the performance of our
   proposed models in the power disaggregation problem.}},

Abstract = {{Short text messages such as tweets are very noisy and sparse in their
   use of vocabulary. Traditional textual representations, such as tf-idf,
   have difficulty grasping the semantic meaning of such texts, which is
   important in applications such as event detection, opinion mining, news
   recommendation, etc. We constructed a method based on semantic word
   embeddings and frequency information to arrive at low-dimensional
   representations for short texts designed to capture semantic similarity.
   For this purpose we designed a weight-based model and a learning
   procedure based on a novel median-based loss function. This paper
   discusses the details of our model and the optimization methods,
   together with the experimental results on both Wikipedia and Twitter
   data. We find that our method outperforms the baseline approaches in the
   experiments, and that it generalizes well on different word embeddings
   without retraining. Our method is therefore capable of retaining most of
   the semantic information in the text, and is applicable out-of-the-box.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes embedding an artificial neural network into a
   wireless sensor network in fully parallel and distributed computation
   mode. The goal is to equip the wireless sensor network with
   computational intelligence and adaptation capability for enhanced
   autonomous operation. The applicability and utility of the proposed
   concept is demonstrated through a case study whereby a Hopfield neural
   network configured as a static optimizer for the weakly-connected
   dominating set problem is embedded into a wireless sensor network to
   enable it to adapt its network infrastructure to potential changes
   on-the-fly and following deployment in the field. Minimum
   weakly-connected dominating set defined for the graph model of the
   wireless sensor network topology is employed to represent the network
   infrastructure and can be recomputed each time the sensor network
   topology changes. A simulation study using the TOSSIM emulator for
   TinyOS-Mica sensor network platform was performed for mote counts of up
   to 1000. Time complexity, message complexity and solution quality
   measures were assessed and evaluated for the case study. Simulation
   results indicated that the wireless sensor network embedded with
   Hopfield neural network as a static optimizer performed competitively
   with other local or distributed algorithms for the weakly connected
   dominating set problem to establish its feasibility.}},

Abstract = {{Computing the semantic similarity/relatedness between terms is an
   important research area for several disciplines, including artificial
   intelligence, cognitive science, linguistics, psychology, biomedicine
   and information retrieval. These measures exploit knowledge bases to
   express the semantics of concepts. Some approaches, such as the
   information theoretical approaches, rely on knowledge structure, while
   others, such as the gloss-based approaches, use knowledge content.
   Firstly, based on structure, we propose a new intrinsic Information
   Content (IC) computing method which is based on the quantification of
   the subgraph formed by the ancestors of the target concept. Taxonomic
   measures including the IC-based ones consume the topological parameters
   that must be extracted from taxonomies considered as Directed Acyclic
   Graphs (DAGs). Accordingly, we propose a routine of graph algorithms
   that are able to provide some basic parameters, such as depth,
   ancestors, descendents, Lowest Common Subsumer (LCS). The IC-computing
   method is assessed using several knowledge structures which are: the
   noun and verb WordNet ``is a{''} taxonomies, Wikipedia Category Graph
   (WCG), and MeSH taxonomy. We also propose an aggregation schema that
   exploits the WordNet ``is a{''} taxonomy and WCG in a complementary way
   through the IC-based measures to improve coverage capacity. Secondly,
   taking content into consideration, we propose a gloss-based semantic
   similarity measure that operates based on the noun weighting mechanism
   using our IC-computing method, as well as on the WordNet, Wiktionary and
   Wikipedia resources. Further evaluation is performed on various items,
   including nouns, verbs, multiword expressions and biomedical datasets,
   using well-recognized benchmarks. The results indicate an improvement in
   terms of similarity and relatedness assessment accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient synthesis algorithm and its proof of
   correctness for computing the controllable, nonblocking, and minimally
   restrictive supervisor in the supervisory control theory. Conventional
   synthesis algorithms are based on backward reachability computations,
   where blocking and uncontrollable states are iteratively found by
   searching the entire state space several times until a fixed point is
   reached. Many unnecessary states may be visited in this kind of
   searching. In this paper, we present an alternative synthesis algorithm
   based on forward reachability, where a number of synthesis steps are
   performed during the reachability computations. This approach is
   inspired from the search techniques in Artificial Intelligence ( AI)
   planning. To handle large-scale problems, the algorithm performs the
   computations symbolically based on binary decision diagrams. The
   algorithm has been developed, implemented, and applied to several
   large-scale benchmarks. It is shown that, on average, the on-the-fly
   algorithm is more efficient than the conventional synthesis algorithms,
   in particular for problems with many uncontrollable states.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the intelligence of the foraging behavior of honeybee
   swarms, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has shown competitive
   performance among evolutionary algorithms. However, despite its strong
   global search ability, its slow convergence speed remains a weakness. To
   compensate for this shortcoming and further improve the standard ABC,
   based on a novel chaotic-based operator and a new neighbor selection
   strategy, our paper proposes a novel update equation and an improved
   dimension selection strategy for employed bees to strike a good balance
   between global search and local tuning abilities. To evaluate its
   performance in both theoretical and practical problems, a series of
   benchmark functions and two real-world applications (Lennard Jones
   potential problem and feature selection problem) are used for testing in
   our paper. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed strategies

Abstract = {{Graphical model processing is a central problem in artificial
   intelligence. The optimization of the combined cost of a network of
   local cost functions federates a variety of famous problems including
   CSP, SAT and Max-SAT but also optimization in stochastic variants such
   as Markov Random Fields and Bayesian networks. Exact solving methods for
   these problems typically include branch and bound and local
   inference-based bounds.
   In this paper we are interested in understanding when and how dynamic
   programming based optimization can be used to efficiently enforce soft
   local consistencies on Global Cost Functions, defined as parameterized
   families of cost functions of unbounded arity. Enforcing local
   consistencies in cost function networks is performed by applying
   so-called Equivalence Preserving Transformations (EPTs) to the cost
   functions. These EPTs may transform global cost functions and make them
   intractable to optimize.
   We identify as tractable projection-safe those global cost functions
   whose optimization is and remains tractable after applying the EPTs used
   for enforcing arc consistency. We also provide new classes of cost
   functions that are tractable projection-safe thanks to dynamic
   programming.
   We show that dynamic programming can either be directly used inside
   filtering algorithms, defining polynomially DAG-filterable cost
   functions, or emulated by arc consistency filtering on a Berge-acyclic
   network of bounded-arity cost functions, defining Berge-acyclic network
   decomposable cost functions. We give examples of such cost functions and
   we provide a systematic way to define decompositions from existing
   decomposable global constraints. These two approaches to enforcing
   consistency in global cost functions are then embedded in a solver for
   extensive experiments that confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our
   proposal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   of the updated step size in MCSA is adapted as generating a new solution
   for the abandoned group and the top group via the Levy flights so that a
   large zone is searched at the beginning and a local zone is foraged as
   the maximum number of iterations is nearly reached. The MCSA method has
   been tested on different systems with different characteristics of
   thermal units and constraints. The result comparison with other methods
   in the literature has indicated that the MCSA method can be a powerful

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) is a novel biological-inspired optimization
   algorithm which has been shown to be more effective for global
   optimization of multimodal and multidimensional optimization problems,
   than some other conventional biological-inspired optimization
   algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm
   optimization (PSO), for its good exploration capability and the
   efficient balance between the local search and the global search
   processes. It has drawn widely attentions from scholars and was applied
   to various fields for its advantages of excellent global optimization
   ability and it is easy to implement. However, the basic ABC has some
   drawbacks such as poor exploitation, slow to converge and hard to find
   the best solution from all feasible solutions in some cases. In this
   paper, a modified ABC algorithm based on improved-global-best-guided
   approach and adaptive-limit strategy for global optimization problems
   called IGAL-ABC algorithm is proposed. An improved-global-best-guided
   term with a nonlinear adjusting factor is employed in the update
   equation. Two nonlinear adjusting factors are applied to control the
   convergence speed and balance the exploration and exploitation
   abilities. Multiple dimensions of solution are perturbed each time for
   generating new candidate food sources. In addition, an adaptive-limit
   strategy is applied to adjust the limit which controls the frequency
   that the employed bee abandons its food source, to improve the
   performance of the algorithm further. Results of experiments tested on
   multiple benchmark functions show that the proposed method is effective
   and has good performance. The comparison experiments illustrate that the
   proposed algorithm has better solution quality and convergence
   characteristics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a comprehensive model is introduced to investigate the
   influence of energy flow on the lifetime of stochastic multi-species
   prey-predator artificial ecosystems. The model consists of a non
   stationary hosting environment with food sources and a few species of
   competing herbivore and carnivore birds that can perform several
   individual and collective behaviors such as flocking, breeding,
   competing, resting, hunting, escaping, seeking, and foraging. The
   experimental results of 11,000 simulations analyzed by Cox univariate
   analysis and hazard function suggest that only a fraction of associated
   energy variables and pairwise interactions between them influence the
   lifetime. The proposed stochastic model can be utilized to simulate the
   complex multi-agent systems and their emergent behavior. Also, the
   proposed statistical analysis of energy flow to estimate the system
   stability and lifetime can be generalized to other physical and
   economical complex systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) optimisation algorithm is a relatively
   simple and recent population-based probabilistic approach for global
   optimisation. The solution search equation of ABC is significantly
   influenced by a random quantity which helps in exploration at the cost
   of exploitation of the search space. In the ABC, there is a high chance
   to skip the true solution due to its large step sizes. In order to
   balance between diversity and convergence in the ABC, a Levy flight
   inspired search strategy is proposed and integrated with ABC. The
   proposed strategy is named as Levy Flight ABC (LFABC) has both the local
   and global search capability simultaneously and can be achieved by
   tuning the Levy flight parameters and thus automatically tuning the step
   sizes. In the LFABC, new solutions are generated around the best
   solution and it helps to enhance the exploitation capability of ABC.
   Furthermore, to improve the exploration capability, the numbers of scout
   bees are increased. The experiments on 20 test problems of different
   complexities and five real-world engineering optimisation problems show
   that the proposed strategy outperforms the basic ABC and recent variants
   of ABC, namely, Gbest-guided ABC, best-so-far ABC and modified ABC in
   most of the experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Financial markets play an important role on the economical and social
   organization of modern society. In these kinds of markets, information
   is an invaluable asset. However, with the modernization of the financial
   transactions and the information systems, the large amount of
   information available for a trader can make prohibitive the analysis of
   a financial asset. In the last decades, many researchers have attempted
   to develop computational intelligent methods and algorithms to support
   the decision-making in different financial market segments. In the
   literature, there is a huge number of scientific papers that investigate
   the use of computational intelligence techniques to solve financial
   market problems. However, only few studies have focused on review the
   literature of this topic. Most of the existing review articles have a
   limited scope, either by focusing on a specific financial market
   application or by focusing on a family of machine learning algorithms.
   This paper presents a review of the application of several computational
   intelligent methods in several financial applications. This paper gives
   an overview of the most important primary studies published from 2009 to
   2015, which cover techniques for preprocessing and clustering of
   financial data, for forecasting future market movements, for mining
   financial text information, among others. The main contributions of this
   paper are: (i) a comprehensive review of the literature of this field,
   (ii) the definition of a systematic procedure for guiding the task of
   building an intelligent trading system and (iii) a discussion about the
   main challenges and open problems in this scientific field. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Numerous studies confirm that customers' shopping behavior can highly be
   managed by many in-store factors such that retail managers try to
   systematically consider them in order to achieve a well established
   solution for shelf-space allocation problem (SSAP). To assist them, we
   develop an approach based on two artificial intelligence techniques to
   facilitate well-designed shelf space management. We propose an iterative
   simulation-optimization approach that integrates customers' shopping
   path in the potential demand and introduces it by simulation in the
   optimization. A profit-based integer programming is also presented that
   the related computer program, being able to solve small-sized instances,
   applies important factors including shelf level utility, attraction of
   store' zones, allocated shelf space, number of product facings, and
   demand substitution effects. The problem is inherently a complex and
   large-sized problem; therefore, we develop two algorithms: GA and hybrid
   GA with imperialist competitive algorithm. The experimental results
   prove good performance of hybrid algorithm in terms of both the solution
   quality and computation time. By embedding this flexible and powerful
   framework in an expert tool, retail managers are capable of making
   effective decisions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal tracking of non-linear systems without knowing system
   dynamics is an important and intractable problem. Based on the framework
   of reinforcement learning (RL) and adaptive dynamic programming, a
   model-free adaptive optimal tracking algorithm is proposed in this
   study. After constructing an augmented system with the tracking errors
   and the reference states, the tracking problem is converted to a
   regulation problem with respect to the new system. Several RL techniques
   are synthesised to form a novel algorithm which learns the optimal
   solution online in real time without any information of the system
   dynamics. Continuous adaptation laws are defined by the current
   observations and the past experience. The convergence is guaranteed by
   Lyapunov analysis. Two simulations on a linear and a non-linear systems
   demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a data-driven optimisation solution for operational index
   control for a class of industrial processes is presented. First, the
   operational index control problem is formulated as an optimal tracking
   control problem. Then, an augmented system composed of the device loop
   dynamics and operational indices dynamics is constructed on two
   different time scales. Since, finding mathematical model of the
   operational indices dynamics is difficult, in contrast to most existing
   operational optimisation and control methods that use a mathematical
   model of the operational indices dynamics, a reinforcement learning
   algorithm based on actor-critic structure is employed to provide a
   data-driven optimisation control method to select optimal process
   setpoints so that the operational indices can track desired values. This
   solution does not require complete knowledge of the industrial process
   dynamics. Moreover, complicated system identification of the dynamics of
   the operational indices is not required. The effectiveness of the
   proposed method is demonstrated by experimental results that are carried
   out on a hardware-in-the-loop emulation system for a mineral grinding
   process.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate and reliable short-term wind speed forecasting can benefit
   the stability of the grid operation. However, it is a challenging issue
   to generate consistently accurate forecasts due to the complex and

   network in combination with wavelet decomposition is proposed to solve
   the defects of the lower accuracy and enhance the model robustness.
   Based on the real data provided by sampling device weak wind turbine
   (type-FD77) in a wind farm plant of East China, the experimental
   evaluation demonstrates that the proposed strategy can significantly
   enhance model robustness and effectively improve the prediction

Abstract = {{The assessment of sustainability provides the actual situation of a site

   which aims to classify agroecosystems with agroforestry systems and
   without agroforestry systems. The sites are classified into two groups:
   Sustainable and Not Sustainable. For data collection we carried out
   technical visits to the rural community of Santa Luzia, in the
   municipality of Tome-Acu, Para Amazon. During the research data of 28
   production units were collected. Finally, the data were submitted to the
   ANN and the results demonstrate the high potential of using

Abstract = {{In social networking sites, it is useful to receive recommendations
   about whom to contact or follow. These recommendations not only allow to
   establish connections with people one might already know in real life
   but also with people or users that have similar interests or are
   potentially interesting. We propose an approach that tackles contact
   (followee) recommendation in Twitter by means of fuzzy logic. This fuzzy
   approach handles recommendation as a link prediction problem and uses
   three types of similarity between a pair of users: tweet similarity,
   followee id similarity, and followee tweet similarity. These
   similarities are calculated by extracting user profiles. These profiles
   are, in turn, obtained by considering Twitter as a heterogeneous
   information network. To test our approach, we crawled a repository of
   6000 users and two million tweets, and we measured accuracy by comparing
   our results with the actual followee lists of the users. These results,
   which are also compared against the results given by state-of-the-art
   methods, show a high accuracy. Other advantages of the fuzzy system
   include a self-explanatory capability and the ability to produce a
   non-binary friendship value.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1236-1251}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Horn clauses can be used in many areas such as logic programming,
   artificial intelligence and formal methods. Horn clause solving is
   closely related to program verification. On the one hand, program
   verification tasks can be translated to Horn clause solving problems. On
   the other hand, Horn clause solving tasks can be accomplished using some
   of the program verification techniques. As a result, Horn clauses can be
   used as an intermediate language in program verification, decoupling the
   verification algorithms from the details of the specific programming
   languages. In this article, we propose a novel method for solving Horn
   clauses, which is inspired by a program verification method called trace
   abstraction refinement. In our method, solvability of Horn clauses is
   verified by alternatively analyzing its unfoldings and constructing and
   manipulating tree automata. Since Horn clauses can serve as an
   intermediate language for program verification, our method generalizes
   the original trace abstraction refinement algorithm, making it easier to
   be used for various program verification tasks. We illustrate some of
   the existing works on how to reduce safety verification tasks of
   multithreaded programs and programs with procedures to Horn clause
   solving problems. Preliminary experimental results are reported.}},

Abstract = {{RCL is an original Artificial Intelligence tool for computing maximal

   extracts one maximal set of information that does not conflict with any

   consensus can go far beyond what is actually shared by all agents. It
   might be endorsed by every agent since it does not conflict with any of
   them. Several types of preference criteria can be selected and iterated
   in order to orient the computation towards some preferred consensuses.
   From a computational point of view RCL relies on an internal

Abstract = {{We introduce a practical computational method that enforces some
   incoming piece of information delta in a clausal Boolean logic knowledge
   base Delta in such a way that delta is not strictly subsumed by the
   resulting knowledge base. delta is not strictly subsumed by Delta' iff
   for every piece of information delta' that is entailed by Delta' and
   that is such that delta' entails delta, we have that delta entails
   delta', too. We claim that this paradigm is a useful form of reasoning
   for both human and artificial intelligence systems. Under a usual
   minimal change policy, it amounts to computing one cardinality-maximal
   satisfiable subset of Delta U \{delta\} that contains delta but that
   does not strictly subsume delta. Although this task is intractable in
   the worst case, we provide a practical method that appears
   experimentally efficient very often, even for large and complex
   knowledge bases.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a focused survey about the presence and the use of
   the concept of ``preferences{''} in Artificial Intelligence. Preferences
   are a central concept for decision making and have extensively been
   studied in disciplines such as economy, operational research, decision
   analysis, psychology and philosophy. However, in the recent years it has
   also become an important topic both for research and applications in
   Computer Science and more specifically in Artificial Intelligence, in
   fields spanning from recommender systems to automatic planning, from non
   monotonic reasoning to computational social choice and algorithmic
   decision theory. The survey essentially covers the basics of preference
   modelling, the use of preference in reasoning and argumentation, the
   problem of compact representations of preferences, preference learning
   and the use of non conventional preference models based on extended
   logical languages. It aims at providing a general reference for all
   researchers both in Artificial Intelligence and Decision Analysis
   interested in this exciting interdisciplinary topic.}},

   importantly, we compare our own implementation of existing approaches on

   than the one reported by the original authors, which we attribute to the
   lack of detail in the original presentation of those approaches. Thus,
   we compare the existing works by what they really offer to the reader,

Abstract = {{Smart electrical grids, which involve the application of intelligent
   information and communication technologies, are becoming the core
   ingredient in the ongoing modernization of the electricity delivery
   infrastructure. Thanks to data mining and artificial intelligence
   techniques that allow the accurate forecasting of power, which
   alleviates many of the cost and operational challenges because, power
   predictions become more certain. Load forecasting (LF) is a vital
   process for the electrical system operation and planning as it provides
   intelligence to energy management. In this paper, a novel LF strategy is
   proposed by employing data mining techniques. In addition to a novel
   load estimation, the proposed LF strategy employs new outlier rejection
   and feature selection methodologies. Outliers are rejected through a
   Distance Based Outlier Rejection (DBOR) methodology. On the other hand,
   selecting the effective features is accomplished through a Hybrid
   technique that combines evidence from two proposed feature selectors.
   The first is a Genetic Based Feature Selector (GBFS), while the second
   is a Rough set Base Feature Selector (RBFS). Then, the filtered data is
   used to give fast and accurate load prediction through a hybrid
   (KNB)-B-3 predictor, which combines KNN and NB classifiers. Experimental
   results have proven the effectiveness of the new outlier rejection,
   feature selection, and load estimation methodologies. Moreover, the
   proposed LF strategy has been compared against recent LF strategies. It
   is shown that the proposed LF strategy has a good impact in maximizing
   system reliability, resilience and stability as it introduces accurate
   load predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Weakly electric fish can perform complex cognitive tasks based on
   extracting information from blurry electric images projected from their
   immediate environment onto their electro-sensitive skin. In particular
   they can be trained to recognize the intrinsic properties of objects
   such as their shape, size and electric nature. They do this by means of
   novel perceptual strategies that exploit the relations between the
   physics of a self-generated electric field, their body morphology and
   the ability to perform specific movement termed probing motor acts
   (PMAs). In this article we artificially reproduce and combine these PMAs
   to build an autonomous control strategy that allows an artificial
   electric sensor to find electrically contrasted objects, and to orbit
   around them based on a minimum set of measurements and simple reactive
   feedback control laws of the probe's motion. The approach does not
   require any simulation models and could be implemented on an autonomous
   underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with artificial electric sense. The
   AUV has only to satisfy certain simple geometric properties, such as
   bi-laterally (left/right) symmetrical electrodes and possess a
   reasonably high aspect (length/width) ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoporosis has recently been acknowledged as a major public health
   issue in developed countries because of the decrease in the quality of
   life of the affected person and the increase in public costs due to
   complete or partial physical disability. The aim of this study was to
   use the J48 algorithm as a classification task for data from women
   exhibiting changes in bone densitometry. The study population included
   all patients treated at the diagnostic center for bone densitometry
   since 2010. Census sample data collection was conducted as all elements
   of the population were included in the sample. The service in question
   provides care to patients via the Brazilian Unified Health System and
   private plans. The results of the classification task were analyzed
   using the J48 algorithm, and among the dichotomized variables associated
   with a diagnosis of osteoporosis, the mean accuracy was 74.0 (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 61.0-68.0) and the mean area under the curve
   of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.65 (95\% CI,
   0.64-0.66), with a mean sensitivity of 76.0 (95\% CI, 76.0-76.0) and a
   mean specificity of 48.0 (95\% CI, 46.0-49.0). The analyzed results
   showed higher values of sensitivity, accuracy, and curve of the ROC area
   in experiments conducted with individuals with osteoporosis. Most of the
   generated rules were consistent with the literature, and the few
   differences might serve as hypotheses for further studies.}},

Abstract = {{By adopting the distributed problem-solving strategy, swarm intelligence
   algorithms have been successfully applied to many optimization problems
   that are difficult to deal with using traditional methods. At present,
   there are many well-implemented algorithms, such as particle swarm
   optimization, genetic algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm, and
   ant colony optimization. These algorithms have already shown favorable
   performances. However, with the objects becoming increasingly complex,
   it is becoming gradually more difficult for these algorithms to meet
   human's demand in terms of accuracy and time. Designing a new algorithm
   to seek better solutions for optimization problems is becoming
   increasingly essential. Dolphins have many noteworthy biological
   characteristics and living habits such as echolocation, information
   exchanges, cooperation, and division of labor. Combining these
   biological characteristics and living habits with swarm intelligence and
   bringing them into optimization problems, we propose a brand new
   algorithm named the `dolphin swarm algorithm' in this paper. We also
   provide the definitions of the algorithm and specific descriptions of
   the four pivotal phases in the algorithm, which are the search phase,
   call phase, reception phase, and predation phase. Ten benchmark
   functions with different properties are tested using the dolphin swarm
   algorithm, particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, and
   artificial bee colony algorithm. The convergence rates and benchmark
   function results of these four algorithms are compared to testify the
   effect of the dolphin swarm algorithm. The results show that in most
   cases, the dolphin swarm algorithm performs better. The dolphin swarm
   algorithm possesses some great features, such as first-slow-then-fast
   convergence, periodic convergence, local-optimum-free, and no specific
   demand on benchmark functions. Moreover, the dolphin swarm algorithm is
   particularly appropriate to optimization problems, with more calls of
   fitness functions and fewer individuals.}},

Abstract = {{We consider problems where a controller communicates with a general
   nonlinear plant via a network, and must optimize a performance index.
   The system is modeled in discrete time and may be affected by a class of
   stochastic uncertainties that can take finitely many values. Admissible
   inputs are constrained to belong to a finite set. Exploiting some
   optimistic planning algorithms from the artificial intelligence field,
   we propose two control strategies that take into account the
   communication constraints induced by the use of the network. Both
   strategies send in a single packet long-horizon solutions, such as
   sequences of inputs. Our analysis characterizes the relationship between
   computation, near-optimality, and transmission intervals. In particular,
   the first strategy imposes at each transmission a desired
   near-optimality, which we show is related to an imposed transmission
   period; for this setting, we analyze the required computation. The
   second strategy has a fixed computation budget, and within this
   constraint it adapts the next transmission instant to the last state
   measurement, leading to a self-triggered policy. For this case, we
   guarantee long transmission intervals. Examples and simulation
   experiments are provided throughout the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Multiobjective density driven evolutionary algorithm (MODdEA) has been
   quite successful in solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs).
   To further improve its performance and address its deficiencies, this
   paper proposes a hybrid evolutionary algorithm based on dimensional
   diversity (DD) and firework explosion (FE). DD is defined to reflect the
   diversity degree of population dimension. Based on DD, a selection
   scheme is designed to balance diversity and convergence. A hybrid
   variation based on FE and genetic operator is designed to facilitate
   diversity of population. The proposed algorithm is tested on 14 tests
   problems with diverse characteristics and compared with three
   state-of-the-art designs. Experimental results show that the proposed
   design is better or at par with the chosen state-of-the-art algorithms

   Then, the computer Go programs that have participated in previous IEEE
   CIS competitions as well as methods and techniques used in Alpha-Go are
   briefly introduced. Commentaries from three high-level professional Go
   players on the five AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol games are also included. We
   conclude that AlphaGo beating Lee Sedol is a huge achievement in
   artificial intelligence (AI) based largely on CI methods. In the future,
   powerful computer Go programs such as AlphaGo are expected to be

Abstract = {{This paper presents the Chebyshev neural network (ChNN) as an improved
   artificial intelligence technique for power system protection studies
   and examines the performances of two ChNN learning algorithms for fault
   classification of series compensated transmission line. The training
   algorithms are least-square Levenberg-Marquardt (LSLM) and recursive
   least-square algorithm with forgetting factor (RLSFF). The performances
   of these algorithms are assessed based on their generalization
   capability in relating the fault current parameters with an event of
   fault in the transmission line. The proposed algorithm is fast in
   response as it utilizes postfault samples of three phase currents
   measured at the relaying end corresponding to half-cycle duration only.
   After being trained with only a small part of the generated fault data,
   the algorithms have been tested over a large number of fault cases with
   wide variation of system and fault parameters. Based on the studies
   carried out in this paper, it has been found that although the RLSFF
   algorithm is faster for training the ChNN in the fault classification
   application for series compensated transmission lines, the LSLM
   algorithm has the best accuracy in testing. The results prove that the
   proposed ChNN-based method is accurate, fast, easy to design, and immune
   to the level of compensations. Thus, it is suitable for digital relaying
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The increase of distributed energy resources, mainly based on renewable
   sources, requires new solutions that are able to deal with this type of
   resources' particular characteristics (namely, the renewable energy
   sources intermittent nature). The smart grid concept is increasing its
   consensus as the most suitable solution to facilitate the small players'
   participation in electric power negotiations while improving energy
   efficiency. The opportunity for players' participation in multiple
   energy negotiation environments (smart grid negotiation in addition to
   the already implemented market types, such as day-ahead spot markets,
   balancing markets, intraday negotiations, bilateral contracts, forward
   and futures negotiations, and among other) requires players to take
   suitable decisions on whether to, and how to participate in each market
   type. This paper proposes a portfolio optimization methodology, which
   provides the best investment profile for a market player, considering
   different market opportunities. The amount of power that each supported
   player should negotiate in each available market type in order to
   maximize its profits, considers the prices that are expected to be
   achieved in each market, in different contexts. The price forecasts are
   performed using artificial neural networks, providing a specific
   database with the expected prices in the different market types, at each
   time. This database is then used as input by an evolutionary particle
   swarm optimization process, which originates the most advantage
   participation portfolio for the market player. The proposed approach is
   tested and validated with simulations performed in multiagent simulator
   of competitive electricity markets, using real electricity markets data
   from the Iberian operator-MIBEL.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this research work is to develop a novel
   benchmark database of digitized and calibrated, cervical cells obtained
   from slides of Papanicolaou smear test, which is done for screening of
   cervical cancer. This database can serve as a potential tool for
   designing, developing, training, testing and validating various
   artificial intelligence based systems for prognosis of cervical cancer
   by characterization and classification of Papanicolaou smear images. The
   database can also be used by other researchers for comparative analysis
   of working efficiencies of various machine learning and image processing
   algorithms. The database can be obtained by sending a request to the
   corresponding author or can be downloaded from
   http://digitalpapsmeardb.in/. Besides developing a rich machine learning
   database we have also presented a novel artificial intelligence based
   hybrid ensemble technique for efficient screening of cervical cancer by
   automated analysis of Papanicolaou smear images. The correct and timely
   diagnosis of cervical cancer is one of the major problems in the medical
   world. From the literature it has been found that different pattern
   recognition techniques can help them to improve in this domain.
   Papanicolaou smear (also referred to as Pap smear) is a microscopic
   examination of samples of human cells scraped from the lower, narrow
   part of the uterus, called cervix. A sample of cells after being stained
   by using Papanicolaou method is analyzed under microscope for the
   presence of any unusual developments indicating any precancerous and
   potentially precancerous developments. Abnormal findings, if observed
   are subjected to further precise diagnostic subroutines. Examining the
   cell images for abnormalities in the cervix provides grounds for
   provision of prompt action and thus reducing incidence and deaths from
   cervical cancer. It is the most popular technique used for screening of
   cervical cancer. Pap smear test, if done with a regular screening
   programs and proper follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer mortality by
   up to 80 \% (Arbyn et al. Ann Oncol 21:48-458, 2010). The contribution
   of this paper is that we have created a rich machine learning database
   of quantitatively profiled and calibrated cervical cells obtained from
   Pap-smear test slides. The database so created consists of data of about
   200 clinical cases (8091 cervical cells), which have been obtained from
   multiple health care centers, so as to ensure diversity in data. The
   Pap-smear slides were processed using a multi-headed digital microscope
   and images of cervical cells were obtained, which were then passed
   through various data preprocessing subroutines. After preprocessing the
   cells were morphologically profiled and scaled to obtain separate
   quantitative measurements of various features of cytoplasm and nucleus
   respectively. The cells in the database were carefully classified in
   different corresponding classes according to the latest 2001-Bethesda
   system of classification, by multiple cytotechnicians and
   histopathologists. In addition to this, we have also pioneered to apply
   a novel hybrid ensemble system to this database in order to evaluate the
   effectiveness of both novel database and novel hybrid ensemble technique
   to screen cervical cancer by categorization of Pap smear data. The paper
   also presents a comparative analysis of multiple artificial intelligence
   based classification algorithms for prognosis of cervical cancer.
   For evaluating the effectiveness and correctness of the digital database
   prepared in this work, authors implemented this database for training,
   testing and validating fifteen different artificial intelligence based
   machine learning algorithms. All the algorithms trained with this
   database presented commendable efficiency in screening of cervical
   cancer. For two-class problem all the algorithms trained with the
   digital database showed the efficiencies in the range of about 93 to 95
   \% while as in case of multi class problem algorithms expressed the
   efficiencies in the range of about 69 to 78 \%. The results indicate
   that the novel digital database prepared in this work can be efficiently
   used for developing new machine learning based techniques for automated
   screening of cervical cancer. The results also indicate that hybrid
   ensemble technique is an efficient method for classification of
   pap-smear images and hence can be effectively used for diagnosis of
   cervical cancer. Among all the algorithms implemented, the hybrid
   ensemble approach outperformed and expressed an efficiency of about 98
   \% for 2-class problem and about 86 \% for 7-class problem. The results
   when compared with the all the standalone classifiers were significantly
   better for both two-class and multi-class problems.}},

Pages = {{21-32}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the new method of the natural frequencies and damping
   identification based on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The identification is performed in the
   frequency domain. The algorithm performs two PSO-based steps and
   introduces some modifications in order to achieve quick convergence and
   low estimation error of the identified parameters' values for multi-mode
   systems. The first stage of the algorithm concentrates on the natural
   frequencies estimation. Using the information about the natural
   frequencies, measurement data are filtered and corrected dampings as
   well as amplitudes are calculated for each preliminary identified mode.
   This allows regrouping particles to the area around proper parameters
   values. Particle regrouping is based on the physical properties of
   modally tested structures. This differs the algorithm from other PSO
   based algorithms with particles regrouping. In the second stage of the
   algorithm parameters of all modes are tuned together in order to adjust
   estimates. The procedure of identification, as well as the appropriate
   algorithm, is presented and some SISO examples are provided. Results are
   compared with the results obtained for the selected, already developed
   modal identification methods. The paper presents practical application
   of AI method for mechanical systems identification. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Based on the characteristics of ready-mixed concrete enterprises, this
   paper puts forward that knowledge management (KM) is an effective way to

   effective production processing. As part of exploratory study,
   artificial neural network coupled with genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) as
   knowledge mining technology is applied in KM system to predict the
   28-day compressive strength in concrete enterprises. The results shows
   that compared to back-propagation artificial neural network, the
   convergence rate of ANN-GA algorithm has been significantly improved and
   almost all the relative errors of predicted compressive strength of

Abstract = {{Machine learning approaches for medical decision-making processes are
   valuable when both high classification accuracy and less feature
   requirements are satisfied. Artificial neural networks (ANNs)
   successfully meet the first goal with its adaptive engine, while
   nature-inspired algorithms are focusing on the feature selection (FS)
   process in order to eliminate less informative and less discriminant
   features. Besides engineering applications of ANN and FS algorithms,
   medical informatics is another emerging field using similar methods for
   medical data processing. Classification of psychiatric disorders is one
   of the major focus of medical informatics using artificial intelligence
   approaches. Being one of the most debilitating psychiatric diseases,
   bipolar disorder (BD) is frequently misdiagnosed as unipolar disorder
   (UD), leading to suboptimal treatment and poor outcomes. Thus,
   discriminating UD and BD at earlier stages of illness could therefore
   help to facilitate efficient and specific treatment. The use of
   quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) cordance as a biomarker has
   greatly enhanced the clinical utility of EEG in psychiatric and
   neurological subjects. In this context, the paper puts forward a study
   using two-step hybridized methodology: particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   algorithm for FS process and ANN for training process. The noteworthy
   performance of ANN-PSO approach stated that it is possible to
   discriminate 31 bipolar and 58 unipolar subjects using selected features
   from alpha and theta frequency bands with 89.89 \% overall
   classification accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has gained considerable popularity
   for the development of distributed enterprise-wide applications within
   the software industry. The SOA paradigm promotes the reusability and
   integrability of software in heterogeneous environments by means of open
   standards. Most software companies capitalize on SOA by discovering and
   composing services already accessible over the Internet, whereas other
   organizations need internal control of applications and develop new
   services with quality-attribute properties tailored to their particular
   environment. Therefore, based on architectural and business
   requirements, developers can elaborate different alternatives within a
   SOA framework to design their software applications. Each of these
   alternatives will imply trade-offs among quality attributes, such as
   performance, dependability and availability, among others. In this
   context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can assist developers in dealing
   with service-oriented design with the positive impact on scalability and
   management of generic quality attributes. In this paper, we offer a
   detailed; conceptualized and synthesized analysis of AI research works
   that have aimed at discovering, composing, or developing services. We
   also identify open research issues and challenges in the aforementioned
   research areas. The results of the characterization of 69 contemporary
   approaches and potential research directions for the areas are also
   shown. It is concluded that AI has aimed at exploiting the semantic
   resources and achieving quality -attribute properties so as to produce
   flexible and adaptive-to-change service discovery, composition, and

Abstract = {{In automated bilateral multi issue negotiations, two intelligent
   automated agents negotiate on behalf of their owners regarding many
   issues in order to reach an agreement. Modeling the opponent can
   excessively boost the performance of the agents and increase the quality
   of the negotiation outcome. State of the art models accomplish this by
   considering some assumptions about the opponent which restricts the
   applicability of the models in real scenarios. In this study, a less
   restricted technique where perceptron units (POPPONENT) are applied in
   modeling the preferences of the opponent is proposed. This model adopts
   the Multi Bipartite version of the Standard Gradient Descent search
   algorithm (MBGD) to find the best hypothesis, which is the best
   preference profile. In order to evaluate the accuracy and performance of
   this proposed opponent model, it is compared with the state of the art
   models available in the Genius repository. This results in the devised
   setting which approves the higher accuracy of POPPONENT compared to the
   most accurate state of the art model. Evaluating the model in the real
   world negotiation scenarios in the Genius framework also confirms its
   high accuracy in relation to the state of the art models in estimating
   the utility of offers. The findings here indicate that this proposed
   model is individually and socially efficient. This proposed MBGD method
   could also be adopted in other practical areas of Artificial
   Intelligence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In power transformer fault diagnosis, dissolved gas analysis (DGA) has
   been widely used to identify the type of the fault. The common methods
   of DGA are IEC 60599 method, Doenenberg's ratio method and Roger's ratio
   method. The accuracy of the DGA diagnosis will determine the cost,
   duration and workload of the maintenance since it can influence the
   error in the maintenance. Although DGA methods have been used widely,
   sometimes they still yield incorrect diagnosis results. Thus, many works
   on transformer fault diagnosis have been proposed previously, which
   include artificial intelligence methods, to improve the accuracy of
   transformer fault diagnosis. However, the accuracy of the previously
   reported works is believed to have rooms for improvement. Therefore, in
   this work, hybrid modified evolutionary particle swarm optimisation-time
   varying acceleration coefficient (MEPSO-TVAC)-artificial neural network
   (ANN) was proposed for transformer fault diagnosis based on dissolved
   gas data. This is due to these two methods have never been proposed for
   transformer fault diagnosis in the past. The performance of the ANN was
   optimised through the proposed MEPSO-TVAC. The superiority of the
   proposed method was demonstrated through comparison with the existing
   DGA methods, unoptimised ANN and previously reported methods in
   literatures. The comparison shows that the proposed hybrid
   MEPSO-TVAC-ANN obtained the highest accuracy among all methods, which
   can then be used for power transformer fault diagnosis. (C) 2016

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{352}},
Pages = {{79-97}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{In the context of humanoid and service robotics, it is essential that
   the agent can be positioned with respect to objects of interest in the
   environment. By relying mostly on the cognitivist conception in
   artificial intelligence, the research on visually guided walking has
   tended to overlook the characteristics of the context in which behavior
   occurs. Consequently, considerable efforts have been directed to define
   action-independent explicit models of the solution, often resulting in
   high computational requirements. In this study, inspired by the embodied
   cognition research, our interest has focused on the analysis of the
   sensory-motor coupling. Notably, on the relation between embodiment,
   information, and action-oriented representation. Hence, by mimicking
   human walking, a behavior scheme is proposed and endowed the agent with
   the skill of approaching stimuli. A significant contribution to object
   discrimination was obtained by proposing an efficient visual attention
   mechanism, that exploits the redundancies and the statistical
   regularities induced in the sensory-motor coordination, thus the
   information flow is anticipated from the fusion of visual and
   proprioceptive features in a Bayesian network. The solution was
   implemented on the humanoid platform Nao, where the task was
   accomplished in an unstructured scenario. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Deep learning is recently regarded as the closest artificial
   intelligence model to human brain. It is about learning multiple levels
   of representation and abstraction that help to make sense of data such
   as images, sound, and text. One deep model often consists of a
   hierarchical architecture that has the capability to model super
   non-linear and stochastic problems. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
   is the main constructing block of current deep networks, as most of deep
   architectures are built with it. Based on MapReduce framework and Hadoop
   distributed file system, this paper proposes a distributed algorithm for
   training the RBM model. Its implementation and performance are evaluated
   on Big Data platform-Hadoop. The main contribution of the new learning
   algorithm is that it solves the scalability problem that limits the
   development of deep learning. The intelligence growing process of human
   brain requires learning from Big Data. The distributed learning
   mechanism for RBM makes it possible to abstract sophisticated and
   informative features from Big Data to achieve high-level intelligence.
   The evaluations of the proposed learning algorithm are carried out on
   image inpainting and classification problems based on the BAS dataset
   and MNIST hand-written digits dataset. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Data fitting and prediction are important in many domains. As computing
   power improves, artificial intelligence fitting methods such as the WASD
   (weights and structure-determination) neuronet become more operable.
   Although the WASD neuronet has been applied to several other issues, its
   application on fitting data needs to be explored and discussed more
   specifically. This paper is committed to introducing the WASD-neuronet
   model activated by Chebyshev polynomials of class 1 for data fitting and
   to exploring its capability of data prediction. The learning-checking
   method and the concept of global minimum point are introduced to improve
   the prediction performance and extend the application of the
   WASD-neuronet model. Applying such a model to Asian population
   prediction substantiates its excellent performance. With numerical
   experiments validating the predicting performance and a final prediction
   based on historical data, this paper presents a reasonable tendency of

Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{89-105}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Banks take great care when dealing with customer loans to avoid any
   improper decisions that can lead to loss of opportunity or financial
   losses. Regarding this, researchers have developed complex credit
   scoring models using statistical and artificial intelligence (AI)
   techniques to help banks and financial institutions to support their
   financial decisions. Various models, from easy to advanced approaches,
   have been developed in this domain. However, during the last few years
   there has been marked attention towards development of ensemble or
   multiple classifier systems, which have proved their ability to be more
   accurate than single classifier models. However, among the multiple
   classifier systems models developed in the literature, there has been
   little consideration given to: 1) combining classifiers of different
   algorithms (as most have focused on building classifiers of the same
   algorithm); or 2) exploring different classifier output combination
   techniques other than the traditional ones, such as majority voting and
   weighted average. In this paper, the aim is to present a new combination
   approach based on classifier consensus to combine multiple classifier
   systems (MCS) of different classification algorithms. Specifically, six
   of the main well-known base classifiers in this domain are used, namely,
   logistic regression (LR), neural networks (NN), support vector machines
   (SVM), random forests (RF), decision trees (DT) and naive Bayes (NB).
   Two benchmark classifiers are considered as a reference point for
   comparison with the proposed method and the other classifiers. These are
   used in combination with LR, which is still considered the
   industry-standard model for credit scoring models, and multivariate
   adaptive regression splines (MARS), a widely adopted technique in credit
   scoring studies. The experimental results, analysis and statistical
   tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed combination method to
   improve prediction performance against all base classifiers, namely, LR,
   MARS and seven traditional combination methods, in terms of average
   accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), the H-measure and Brier score
   (BS). The model was validated over five real-world credit scoring
   datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Application of hybrid computational intelligence models in short-term
   bus load forecasting}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{105-120}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a favorable scheme in load
   forecasting applications mainly due to their endogenous capacity of
   robust modeling of data sets with highly non-linear relationship between
   inputs and outputs. Usually, the inputs correspond to historical load
   values, exogenous variables like temperature, day type identification
   codes and others. The outputs refer to the load values under
   examination. The majority of the load forecasting related literature
   focuses in aggregated load system level. While contemporary research
   efforts focus in smart grid technologies, there is need to study the
   characteristics of small scaled loads. Bus load forecasting refers to
   prediction of the demand patterns in buses of the transmission and
   distribution systems. Bus load exhibits low correlation with the
   aggregated system load, since it is characterized by a high level of
   stochasticity. Hence, a proper selection and formulation of the
   forecasting model is essential in order to keep the prediction accuracy
   within acceptable ranges. The treatment of bus load characteristics is
   held with computational intelligence techniques such as clustering and
   ANN. Neural network based systems are a favorable scheme in recent years
   in price and load predictions over traditional time series models. ANN
   can fully adapt expert knowledge and modify their parameters accordingly
   to simulate the problem's attributions through training paradigms. Thus,
   ANN based systems are an essential choice, justified by the paper's
   findings, for highly volatile time series. This work focuses on the
   short-term load forecasting (STLF) of a number of buses within the Greek
   interconnected system. Firstly, a modified version of the ANN already
   proposed for the aggregated load of the interconnected system is
   employed. To enhance the forecasting accuracy of the ANN, the load
   profiling methodology is used resulting to the formulation of two novel
   hybrid forecasting models. These models refer to the combination of the
   ANN with a clustering algorithm, resulting to superior performance.
   Simulation results indicate that the combination captures and
   successfully treats the special characteristics of the bus load
   patterns. The scope of the present paper is to develop efficient
   forecasting systems for short-term bus load predictions. This is a
   current research challenge due to the high interest for smart grids and
   demand side management applications by utilities, regulators, retailer
   and energy service companies. Bus load forecasting appears to be a more
   difficult engineering problem compared to forecasting of the total load
   of a country. No hybrid models for bus load predictions have been
   presented so far in the literature. Two novel clustering based tools are
   developed and successfully tested in a number of loads covering
   different types of electricity consumers and demand levels. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In recent years, increasing demands for more efficient high speed
   milling (HSM) processes have propelled the application and development
   of more effective modeling methods and intelligent machining approaches.
   Hence, a desired reference model has to incorporate more efficient and
   sophisticated feature extraction and artificial intelligence (AI)
   techniques aiming for more repeatability and generalizability.
   In our work, wavelet analysis is applied for feature extraction to
   provide a better insight into time frequency changes of the process.
   Considering the high dimension of extracted wavelet features, dimension
   reduction methods, such as clustering techniques are inevitable. They
   are applied as an interpretation layer between the feature extraction
   and artificial intelligence subsystems to form a new model structure for
   HSM with generalizability and sequential learning capability.
   We introduce a new architecture that incorporates the advantages of
   fuzzy clustering into well known dynamic fuzzy neural networks (DFNN) to
   form an online condition monitoring system which is tolerant to slight
   drifts in process dynamics and adaptable to variations in parameters and
   device. Sequential Fuzzy Clustering Dynamic based Fuzzy Neural Networks
   (SFCDFNN) is developed and successfully applied for monitoring of an HSM
   process. It is able to sequentially learn the model and adapt itself to
   variations and also provide an estimation or prediction on the status of
   the process. It facilitates for nonintrusive fault diagnosis and
   prognosis. Lastly, its performance on modeling of experimental data is
   practically illustrated and compared to its other counterparts. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Would it be possible to bring the promise of unlimited re-playability
   typically reserved for Roguelike games to competitive multiplayer
   shooters? This paper tries to address this issue by proposing a novel
   method to dynamically generate maps at run-time almost as soon as
   players press the Play button, while ensuring the features what players
   would expect from the genre. The procedures are simple and practically
   feasible to be employed in actual computer games. In addition, the work
   experiments the possibility of incorporating asynchronous game-play
   element into a multiplayer shooter with human imitating bots where the
   players can let their bot/avatar replace them when they are not around.
   The algorithms are implemented and evaluated with a playable game. The
   evaluations prove that playable 3D dynamic maps can be generated in
   order of seconds using game context data to initialise the parameters of
   the algorithm. The paper also shows that asynchronous game-play element
   is a possible feature for consideration in next generation multiplayer
   shooters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Applications in epileptic seizure detection and prediction}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Feature selection is a well-studied problem in the areas of pattern
   recognition and artificial intelligence. Apart from reducing
   computational cost and time, a good feature subset is also imperative in
   improving the classification accuracy of automated classifiers. In this
   work, a wrapper-based feature selection approach is proposed using the
   evolutionary harmony search algorithm, whereas the classifiers used are
   the wavelet neural networks. The metaheuristic algorithm is able to find
   near-optimal solutions within a reasonable amount of iterations. The
   modifications are accomplished in two ways initialization of harmony
   memory and improvisation of solutions. The proposed algorithm is tested
   and verified using UCI benchmark data sets, as well as two real life
   binary classification problems, namely epileptic seizure detection and
   prediction. The simulation results show that the standard harmony search
   algorithm and other similar metaheuristic algorithms give comparable
   performance. In addition, the enhanced harmony search algorithm
   outperforms the standard harmony search algorithm. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Searching for a missing person is not an easy task to accomplish, so
   over the years search methods have been developed, the problem is that
   the methods currently available have certain limitations and these
   limitations are reflected in time location. Time location in a person
   search is a very important factor that rescuers cannot afford to waste
   because the missing person is exposed to great dangers. In people search
   the vision system of the human being plays a very important role. The
   human visual system has the ability to detect and identify objects such
   as trees, walls, people among others besides to estimate the distance to
   them, this gives the human being the possibility of moving in their
   environment. With the development of artificial intelligence primarily
   to computer vision it is possible to model the human visual perception
   and generate computer software needed to simulate these capabilities.
   Using computer vision is expected to search for any missing person
   designing and implementing algorithms in order to an Unmanned Aerial
   Vehicle perform this task, also thanks to the speed of this is expected
   to reduce the time location. By using of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle is
   not intended to replace the human being in the difficult task of
   searching and rescuing people but rather is intended to serve as a

Abstract = {{The classical Square Root Law formula for emergency travel times
   consists of one observable component, the density of patrol coverage,
   and one unknown component that must be estimated empirically, the
   effective travel speed. The effective travel speed is typically assumed
   to be an empirical constant. We test whether this simplifying assumption
   is justified empirically. We propose a modern machine-learning approach
   and a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression to
   incorporate into a travel speed model various exogenous factors such as
   call type, incident location, weather conditions and traffic congestion.
   The value of the proposed analytical approach and some practical
   implications are demonstrated using operational data from a large urban
   police jurisdiction based in British Columbia, Canada. Although the
   analysis is framed within the context of urban emergency police
   operations, the proposed approach has the potential to be useful for
   other emergency services or roving business units that deal with
   unscheduled service calls.}},

   networks, and method using load flow and genetic algorithm is applicable
   to doubly-fed distribution network. For comparison purposes, additional
   method was developed that uses neural networks for the decision-making

Abstract = {{An improved differential evolution (IDE) algorithm-based Elman neural
   network (ENN) controller is proposed to control a squirrel-cage
   induction generator (SCIG) system for grid-connected wind power
   applications. First, the control characteristics of a wind turbine
   emulator are introduced. Then, an AC/DC converter and a DC/AC inverter
   are developed to convert the electric power generated by a three-phase
   SCIG to the grid. Moreover, the dynamic model of the SCIG system is
   derived for the control of the square of DC-link voltage according to
   the principle of power balance. Furthermore, in order to improve the
   transient and steady-state responses of the square of DC-link voltage of
   the SCIG system, an IDE-based ENN controller is proposed for the control
   of the SCIG system. In addition, the network structure and the online
   learning algorithm of the ENN are described in detail. Additionally,
   according to the different wind speed variations, a lookup table built
   offline by the dynamic model of the SCIG system using the IDE is
   provided for the optimisation of the learning rates of ENN. Finally, to
   verify the control performance, some experimental results are provided
   to verify the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed SCIG
   system for grid-connected wind power applications.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-objective path finding (MOPF) problems are widely applied in both
   academic and industrial areas. In order to deal with the MOPF problem
   more effectively, we propose a novel model that can cope with both
   deterministic and random variables. For the experiment, we compared five
   intelligence-optimization algorithms: the genetic algorithm, artificial
   bee colony (ABC), ant colony optimization (ACO), biogeography-based
   optimization (BBO), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). After a
   100-run comparison, we found the BBO is superior to the other four
   algorithms with regard to success rate. Therefore, the BBO is effective
   in MOPF problems.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{NASA and the international aviation community are investing in the
   development of a commercial transportation infrastructure that includes
   the increased use of rotorcraft, specifically helicopters and civil tilt
   rotors. However, there is significant concern over the impact of noise
   on the communities surrounding the transportation facilities. One way to
   address the rotorcraft noise problem is by exploiting powerful search
   techniques coming from artificial intelligence to design low-noise
   flight profiles that can be then validated though field tests. This
   article investigates the use of discrete heuristic search methods to
   design low-noise approach trajectories for rotorcraft. Our work builds
   on a long research tradition in trajectory optimization using either
   numerical methods or discrete search. Novel features of our approach
   include the use of a discrete search space with a resolution that can be
   varied, and the coupling of search with a robust simulator to evaluate
   candidates. The article includes a systematic comparison of different
   search techniques; in particular, in the experiments, we are able to do
   a trade study that compares complete search algorithms such as A{*} with
   faster but approximate methods such as local search.}},

Abstract = {{Great successes of deep neural networks have been witnessed in various
   real applications. Many algorithmic and implementation techniques have
   been developed; however, theoretical understanding of many aspects of
   deep neural networks is far from clear. A particular interesting issue
   is the usefulness of dropout, which was motivated from the intuition of
   preventing complex co-adaptation of feature detectors. In this paper, we
   study the Rademacher complexity of different types of dropouts, and our
   theoretical results disclose that for shallow neural networks (with one
   or none hidden layer) dropout is able to reduce the Rademacher
   complexity in polynomial, whereas for deep neural networks it can
   amazingly lead to an exponential reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Parameter identification or estimation is important to model
   simulations. This paper firstly carried out a sensitivity analysis of a
   water quality model using the Monte Carlo method. Then, two hybrid swarm
   intelligence algorithms were proposed to identify the parameters of the
   model based on the artificial bee colony and quantum-behaved particle
   swarm algorithms. One hybrid strategy is to use sequential framework,
   and the other is to use parallel adaptive cooperative evolving. The
   results of sensitivity analysis reveal that the average velocity and
   area of the river section are well identified, and the longitudinal
   dispersion coefficient is difficult to identify. The velocity is the
   most sensitive, followed by the dispersion and area parameters.
   Furthermore, the posterior parameter distribution and the collaborative
   relationship between any two parameters can be gotten. To verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed hybrid algorithms, this paper compared
   performances of the artificial bee colony, quantum-behaved particle
   swarm, their sequential combinations, and parallel adaptive dual
   populations. The experimental results demonstrate that the parallel dual
   population method is more effective than the original algorithms, when
   the data has added noise.}},

Abstract = {{A stock selection model with both discrete and continuous decision
   variables is proposed, in which a novel sigmoid-based mixed
   discrete-continuous differential evolution algorithm is especially
   developed for model optimization. In particular, a stock scoring
   mechanism is first designed to evaluate candidate stocks based on their
   fundamental and technical features, and the top-ranked stocks are
   selected to formulate an equal-weighted portfolio. Generally, the
   proposed model makes literature contributions from two main
   perspectives. First, to determine the optimal solution in terms of
   feature selections (discrete variables) and the corresponding weights
   (continuous variables), the original differential evolution algorithm
   focusing only on continuous problems is extended to a novel mixed
   discrete-continuous variant based on sigmoid-based conversion for the
   discrete part. Second, the stock selection model also resolves the gap
   of the application of differential evolution algorithm to stock
   selection. Using the Shanghai A share market of China as the study
   sample, the empirical results show that the novel stock selection model
   can make a profitable portfolio and significantly outperform its
   benchmarks (with other model designs and optimization algorithms used in
   the existing studies) in terms of both investment return and model
   robustness.}},

Abstract = {{For millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input-multiple-output
   (MIMO) systems, codebook-based analog beamforming (including transmit
   precoding and receive combining) is usually used to compensate the
   severe attenuation of mmWave signals. However, conventional beamforming
   schemes involve complicated search among pre-defined codebooks to find
   out the optimal pair of analog precoder and analog combiner. To solve
   this problem, by exploring the idea of turbo equalizer together with the
   tabu search (TS) algorithm, we propose a Turbo-like beamforming scheme
   based on TS, which is called Turbo-TS beamforming in this paper, to
   achieve near-optimal performance with low complexity. Specifically, the
   proposed Turbo-TS beamforming scheme is composed of the following two
   key components: 1) Based on the iterative information exchange between
   the base station (BS) and the user, we design a Turbo-like joint search
   scheme to find out the near-optimal pair of analog precoder and analog
   combiner; and 2) inspired by the idea of the TS algorithm developed in
   artificial intelligence, we propose a TS-based precoding/combining
   scheme to intelligently search the best precoder/combiner in each
   iteration of Turbo-like joint search with low complexity. Analysis shows
   that the proposed Turbo-TS beamforming can considerably reduce the
   searching complexity, and simulation results verify that it can achieve
   near-optimal performance.}},

Abstract = {{Many real-world scheduling problems are solved to obtain optimal
   solutions in term of processing time, cost, and quality as optimization
   objectives. Currently, energy-efficiency is also taken into
   consideration in these problems. However, this problem is NP-hard, so
   many search techniques are not able to obtain a solution in a reasonable
   time. In this paper, a genetic algorithm is developed to solve an
   extended version of the Job-shop Scheduling Problem in which machines
   can consume different amounts of energy to process tasks at different
   rates (speed scaling). This problem represents an extension of the
   classical job-shop scheduling problem, where each operation has to be
   executed by one machine and this machine can work at different speeds.
   The evaluation section shows that a powerful commercial tool for solving
   scheduling problems was not able to solve large instances in a
   reasonable time, meanwhile our genetic algorithm was able to solve all
   instances with a good solution quality.}},

Title = {{Development of two novel face-recognition CAPTCHAs: A security and
   usability study}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& SECURITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{95-116}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{CAPTCHAs are challenge-response tests that aim at preventing unwanted
   machines, including bots, from accessing web services while providing
   easy access for humans. Recent advances in artificial-intelligence based
   attacks show that the level of security provided by many
   state-of-the-art text-based CAPTCHAs is declining. At the same time,
   techniques for distorting and obscuring the text, which are used to
   maintain the level of security, make text-based CAPTCHAs difficult to
   solve for humans, and thereby further degrade usability. The need for
   developing alternative types of CAPTCHAs that improve both the current
   security and the usability levels has been emphasized widely.
   With this study, we contribute to research through (1) the development
   of two new face recognition CAPTCHAs (Farett-Gender and
   Farett-Gender\&Age), (2) the security analysis of both procedures, and
   (3) the provision of empirical evidence that one of the suggested
   CAPTCHAs (Farett-Gender) is similar to Google's reCAPTCHA and better
   than KCAPTCHA concerning effectiveness (error rates), superior to both
   regarding learnability and satisfaction but not efficiency. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Bayesian networks (BN) implement a graphical model structure known as a
   directed acyclic graph (DAG) that is popular in statistics, machine

   the measure of arc strength using resampling techniques. Moreover, it
   shows how `what-if' sensitivity scenarios are generated with BN using
   hard and soft evidence in the framework of predictive inference.
   Establishing a robust network structure and using it for decision
   support are two essential enablers for efficient and effective
   applications of BN to improvements of products and processes. A

   approaches}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{177}},
Pages = {{139-148}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{One of the biggest challenges in Supply Chain Management (SCM) is to
   forecast sporadic demand. Our forecasting methods' arsenal includes
   Croston's method, SBA and TSB as well as some more recent non parametric
   advances, but none of these can identify and extrapolate patterns
   existing in data; this is essential as these patterns do appear quite
   often, driven by infrequent but nevertheless repetitive managerial
   practices. One could claim such patterns could be picked up by
   Artificial Intelligence approaches, however these do need large training
   datasets, unfortunately non-existent in industrial time series. Nearest
   neighbors (NN) can however operate in these latter contexts, and pick up
   patterns even in short series. In this research we propose applying NN
   for supply chain data and we investigate the conditions under which
   these perform adequately through an extensive simulation. Furthermore,
   via an empirical investigation in automotive data we provide evidence
   that practitioners could benefit from employing supervised NN
   approaches. The contribution of this research is not in the development
   of a new theory, but in the proposition of a new conceptual framework
   that brings existing theory (i.e. NN) from Computer Science and
   Statistics and applies it successfully in an SCM setting. (C) 2016

Title = {{A power efficient cluster-based routing algorithm for wireless sensor
   networks: Honeybees swarm intelligence based approach}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{69}},

Abstract = {{The design of low-power scalable wireless sensor networks remains a key
   challenge of the research. Clustering and routing have been widely
   studied for extending the lifetime of a network, which is a critical
   issue in sensor networks. Routing involves non-negligible operations,
   which considerably affect the network lifetime and the throughput. The
   clustering technique with data aggregation on cluster heads has an
   influence on the overall performance of the network since it is favoring
   a maximum network lifetime. This paper presents a novel cluster-based
   routing protocol called ABC-SD. The proposed protocol exploits the
   biologically inspired fast and efficient searching features of the
   Artificial Bee Colony metaheuristic to build low-power clusters. For the
   choice of cluster heads, a multi-objective fitness function is designed
   by using a Linear Programming formulation. The routing problem is
   addressed by a cost-based function that makes a trade-off between the
   energy efficiency and the number of hops of the path. The clustering
   process is achieved at the Base Station with a centralized control
   algorithm, which exploits energy levels and the neighborhood information
   of location-unaware sensors. As for the routing of gathered data, it is
   realized in a distributed manner. Furthermore, unlike the existing
   protocols in the literature, a realistic energy model is adopted in the
   considered network model. The proposed protocol is intensively
   experimented with a number of topologies in various network scenarios
   and the results are compared with the well-known cluster-based routing
   protocols that include the swarm intelligence based protocols. The
   obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol
   in terms of network lifetime, network coverage and the amount of packets
   delivered to the Base Station. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The present paper deals with the use of systems and devices with
   artificial intelligence in the motor vehicle driving. The main objective
   of transport operations is a transportation planning with minimum energy
   consumption. There are various methods for energy saving, and the paper
   discusses one of them proper planning of transport operations. To gain
   proper planning it is necessary to involve the system and devices with
   artificial intelligence. They will display possible developments in the
   choice of one or another transport plan. Consequently, it can be
   supposed how much the plan is effective against the spent energy. The
   intelligent device considered in this paper consists of an algorithm, a
   database, and the internet for the connection to other intelligent
   devices. The main task of the target function is to minimize the total
   downtime at intermediate stations. A specific unique PHPbased computer
   model was created. It uses the MySQL database for simulation data
   storage and processing. Conclusions based on the experiments were made.
   The experiments showed that after optimization, a train can pass
   intermediate stations without making multiple stops breaking and
   accelerating, which leads to decreased energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{We have two motivations. Firstly, semantic gap is a tough problem
   puzzling almost all sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence. We think
   semantic gap is the conflict between the abstractness of high-level
   symbolic definition and the details, diversities of low-level stimulus.
   Secondly, in object recognition, a pre-defined prototype of object is
   crucial and indispensable for bi-directional perception processing. On
   the one hand this prototype was learned from perceptional experience,
   and on the other hand it should be able to guide future downward
   processing. Human can do this very well, so physiological mechanism is
   simulated here. We utilize a mechanism of classical and non-classical
   receptive field (nCRF) to design a hierarchical model and form a
   multi-layer prototype of an object. This also is a realistic definition
   of concept, and a representation of denoting semantic. We regard this
   model as the most fundamental infrastructure that can ground semantics.
   Here a AND-OR tree is constructed to record prototypes of a concept, in
   which either raw data at low-level or symbol at high-level is feasible,
   and explicit production rules are also available. For the sake of pixel
   processing, knowledge should be represented in a data form; for the sake
   of scene reasoning, knowledge should be represented in a symbolic form.
   The physiological mechanism happens to be the bridge that can join them
   together seamlessly. This provides a possibility for finding a solution
   to semantic gap problem, and prevents discontinuity in low-order
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Shear failure of concrete elements reinforced with Fiber Reinforced
   Polymer (FRP) bars is generally brittle, requiring accurate predictions
   to avoid it. In the last decade, a variety of artificial intelligence
   based approaches have been successfully applied to predict the shear
   capacity of FRP Reinforced Concrete (FRP-RC). In this paper, a new
   approach, namely, biogeography-based programming (BBP) is introduced for
   predicting the shear capacity of FRP-RC beams based on test results
   available in the literature. The performance of the BBP model is
   compared with several shear design equations, two previously developed
   artificial intelligence models and experimental results. It was found
   that the proposed model provides the most accurate results in
   calculating the shear capacity of FRP-RC beams among the considered
   shear capacity models. The proposed BBP model can also correctly predict
   the trend of different influencing variables on the shear capacity of
   FRP-RC beams. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{By representing the constraints and objective function in factorized
   form, graphical models can concisely define various NP-hard optimization
   problems. They are therefore extensively used in several areas of
   computer science and artificial intelligence. Graphical models can be
   deterministic or stochastic, optimize a sum or product of local
   functions, defining a joint cost or probability distribution. Simple
   transformations exist between these two types of models, but also with
   MaxSAT or linear programming. In this paper, we report on a large
   comparison of exact solvers which are all state-of-the-art for their own
   target language. These solvers are all evaluated on deterministic and
   probabilistic graphical models coming from the Probabilistic Inference
   Challenge 2011, the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition OpenGM2
   benchmark, the Weighted Partial MaxSAT Evaluation 2013, the MaxCSP 2008
   Competition, the MiniZinc Challenge 2012 \& 2013, and the CFLib (a
   library of Cost Function Networks). All 3026 instances are made publicly
   available in five different formats and seven formulations. To our
   knowledge, this is the first evaluation that encompasses such a large
   set of related NP-complete optimization frameworks, despite their tight
   connections. The results show that a small number of evaluated solvers
   are able to perform well on multiple areas. By exploiting the
   variability and complementarity of solver performances, we show that a
   simple portfolio approach can be very effective. This portfolio won the
   last UAI Evaluation 2014 (MAP task).}},

Title = {{Two-stage SAR image segmentation framework with an efficient union

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{30-44}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel two-stage image segmentation framework by
   artificial immune system (AIS) thereof to partition synthetic aperture
   radar (SAR) images. The following three crucial tough problems have not
   been completely solved in current SAR image processing community thus
   far: (1) the automatic ability of discovering the true number of
   categories in different types of land covers; (2) the skill of smoothing
   speckle noise in SAR imagery, which is different from classical Gaussian
   and Salt \& Pepper noise; (3) the better clustering performance in
   segmenting thousands of highly contaminating pixels in SAR image. With
   above three problems as goals, an effective two-stage SAR image
   segmentation framework (TSIS) is discussed here. Firstly, a union
   filter, combing maximum likelihood estimator and partial nonlocal means
   filter, is designed. Afterwards, a searching algorithm with variable
   length of chromosomes is designed to automatically discover the
   clustering numbers in SAR images. Finally, an efficient multi-objective
   clustering paradigm in AIS and kernel mapping thereof to implement final
   image partition is proposed. To test its performance, a systematic
   comparison of TSIS versus three famous variations of fuzzy c-means (FCM)
   and two graph partitioning methods is given. Experiments results show
   that TSIS can provide an effective option in segmenting the SAR imagery.

Title = {{A computational intelligence approach to efficiently predicting review
   ratings in e-commerce}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{153-162}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Sentiment analysis, also called opinion mining, is currently one of the
   most studied research fields which aims to analyse people's opinions.
   E-commerce websites allow users to share opinions about a
   product/service by providing textual reviews along with numerical
   ratings. These opinions greatly influence future consumer purchasing
   decisions. This paper introduces an innovative computational
   intelligence framework for efficiently predicting customer review
   ratings. The framework has been designed to deal with the dimensionality
   and noise which is typically apparent in large datasets containing
   customer reviews. The proposed framework integrates the techniques of
   Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and dimensionality reduction, Fuzzy
   C-Means (FCM) and the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The
   performance of the proposed approach returned high accuracy and the
   results revealed that when large datasets are concerned, only a fraction
   of the data is needed for creating a system to predict the review
   ratings of textual reviews. Results from the experiments suggest that
   the proposed approach yields better prediction performance than other
   state-of-the-art rating predictors which are based on the conventional
   Artificial Neural Network, Fuzzy C-Means, and Support Vector Machine
   approaches. In addition, the proposed framework can be utilised for
   other classification and prediction tasks, and its neuro-fuzzy predictor
   module can be replaced by other classifiers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Concept generalization and fusion for abstractive sentence generation}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{43-56}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Text summarization is either extractive or abstractive. Extractive
   summarization is to select the most salient pieces of information
   (words, phrases, and/or sentences) from a source document without adding
   any external information. Abstractive summarization allows an internal
   representation of the source document so as to produce a faithful
   summary of the source. In this case, external text can be inserted into
   the generated summary. Because of the complexity of the abstractive
   approach, the vast majority of work in text summarization has adopted an
   extractive approach.
   In this work, we focus on concepts fusion and generalization, i.e. where
   different concepts appearing in a sentence can be replaced by one
   concept which covers the meanings of all of them. This is one operation
   that can be used as part of an abstractive text summarization system.
   The main goal of this contribution is to enrich the research efforts on
   abstractive text summarization with a novel approach that allows the
   generalization of sentences using semantic resources. This work should
   be useful in intelligent systems more generally since it introduces a
   means to shorten sentences by producing more general (hence abstractions
   of the) sentences. It could be used, for instance, to display shorter
   texts in applications for mobile devices. It should also improve the
   quality of the generated text summaries by mentioning key (general)
   concepts. One can think of using the approach in reasoning systems where
   different concepts appearing in the same context are related to one
   another with the aim of finding a more general representation of the
   concepts. This could be in the context of Goal Formulation, expert
   systems, scenario recognition, and cognitive reasoning more generally.
   We present our methodology for the generalization and fusion of concepts
   that appear in sentences. This is achieved through (1) the detection and
   extraction of what we define as generalizable sentences and (2) the
   generation and reduction of the space of generalization versions. We
   introduce two approaches we have designed to select the best sentences
   from the space of generalization versions. Using four NLTK1 corpora, the
   first approach estimates the ``acceptability{''} of a given
   generalization version. The second approach is Machine Learning-based
   and uses contextual and specific features. The recall, precision and
   Fl-score measures resulting from the evaluation of the concept
   generalization and fusion approach are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Artificial intelligence (AI) is making computer systems intelligent to
   do right thing. The AI is used today in a variety of fields, such as
   journalism, medical, industry as well as entertainment. The impact of AI
   is becoming larger day after day. In general, the AI system has to lead
   the optimal decision under uncertainty. But it is difficult for the AI
   system can derive the best conclusion. In addition, we have a trouble to
   represent the intelligent capacity of AI in numeric values. Statistics
   has the ability to quantify the uncertainty by two approaches of
   frequentist and Bayesian. So in this paper, we propose a methodology of
   the connection between statistics and AI efficiently. We compute a fixed
   value for estimating the population parameter using the frequentist
   learning. Also we find a probability distribution to estimate the
   parameter of conceptual population using Bayesian learning. To show how
   our proposed research could be applied to practical domain, we collect
   the patent big data related to Apple company, and we make the AI more
   intelligent to understand Apple's technology.}},

Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{The minority game is a simple game theory model for describing the
   collective behavior of agents in an idealized situation where they
   compete for some finite resources. In this paper, we assume that
   collective behavior is generated by the aggregation of independent
   actions of agents and the action follows the minority game. A
   probabilistic machine learning model is proposed to model the generative
   process of how collective behavior emerges from individual actions. By
   training on collective data, we can infer the most likely parameters use
   the trained system to make predictions. This model can be regarded as a
   new learning paradigm of analyzing collective data by decomposing the
   generative process into independent micro-level games. To demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the model, we conduct experiments on an artificial
   data set and the real-world data. A set of selected stock indices are

Abstract = {{Gearboxes are crucial devices in rotating power transmission systems
   with applications in a variety of industries. Gearbox faults can cause
   catastrophic physical consequences, long equipment downtimes, and severe
   production costs. Several artificial neural networks, learning
   algorithms, and feature selection methods have been used in the
   diagnosis of the gearbox healthy state. Given a specific gearbox, this
   study investigates how these approaches compare with each other in terms
   of the typical fault classification accuracy but also in terms of the
   area under curve (AUC), where the curve refers to the precision recall
   curve otherwise known as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
   In particular, the comparison aims at identifying whether there are
   statistically significant (dis)similarities among six feature selection
   methods, and seven pairs of neural nets with different learning rules.
   Genetic algorithm based, entropy based, linear discriminants, principal
   components, most neighbors first, and non-negative matrix factorization
   are the studied feature selection methods. Feed forward perceptrons,
   cascade forward, probabilistic nets, and radial basis function neural
   nets are evaluated. Six supervised and one unsupervised learning rules
   are considered. Both parametric and nonparametric statistical tests are
   employed. A ranking process is defined to elect the best approach, when
   available. An experimental setup was especially prepared to ensure
   operating conditions as realistic as possible. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

   transducer to measure temperature in the range of 0 degrees C-100
   degrees C using a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor. The

   temperature change into frequency. The timer circuit acts as a signal
   conditioning circuit (SCC) for the NTC thermistor and exhibits a stable
   temperature-frequency characteristic with a reasonable error. The
   Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm is used in a multilayer
   perceptron neural network to further reduce the nonlinearity error of
   the SCC. The trained artificial neural network (ANN) improved the
   linearity, sensitivity, and precision of the SCC to an appreciable
   range. A linearity of approximately similar to 0.8\% and the sensitivity
   of about 5 kHz/degrees C are achieved. The intelligence of the trained
   ANN is embedded in a microcontroller unit, and the performance of the

   reconstruction of the heat flux and the distribution of temperature in
   the process of binary alloy solidification when the temperature

   conduction equation with the substitute thermal capacity and with the
   liquidus and solidus temperatures varying in dependence on the
   concentration of the alloy component, whereas for describing the
   concentration the lever arm model is applied. An important part of the

Title = {{An intelligent pattern recognition model for supporting investment
   decisions in stock market}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{346}},

Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{For many years, how to make stock market predictions has been a
   prevalent research topic. To carry out accurate forecasting, stock
   analysts and academic researchers have tried various analysis
   techniques, algorithms, and models. For example, ``technical
   analysis{''} is a popular approach used by common stock investors to
   analyze market trend, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms such
   as genetic algorithms (GAs), neural network (NN), and fuzzy time-series
   (FTS), were proposed by researchers to forecast the future stock index.
   Although the daily forecasts are very useful for professional investors
   who implement intraday trading, we argue that forecasting a bullish
   turning point is a more interesting issue than the future stock index
   for common investor because an accurate forecast will bring a huge
   amount of stock return. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent
   pattern recognition model, based on two new stock pattern recognition
   methods, ``PIP bull-flag pattern matching{''} and the
   ``floating-weighted bull-flag template,{''} to recognize a bull-flag
   stock pattern. The bull-flag pattern is a stock's turning point with
   proper timing, which can enable a stock investor to profit. To promote
   recognition accuracy, the proposed model employs chart patterns and
   technical indicators, simultaneously, as pattern recognition factors. In
   the model verification, we evaluate the proposed model with stock
   returns by forecasting two stock databases (TAIEX and NASDAQ), and
   comparing the returns with other advanced algorithms. The experimental
   results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the published
   algorithms, such as rough set theory (RST), genetic algorithms (GAs) and
   their hybrid model, and gives a high-level of profitability.
   Additionally, the trading strategies, provided by the proposed model,
   also help investors to make beneficial investment decisions in the stock
   market. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have witnessed a large increase in the amount of
   information available from the Web and many other sources. Such an
   information deluge presents a challenge for individuals who have to
   identify useful information items to complete particular tasks in hand.
   Information value theory (IVT) from economics and artificial
   intelligence has provided some guidance on this issue. However, existing
   IVT studies often focus on monetary values, while ignoring the
   spatiotemporal properties which can play important roles in everyday
   tasks. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for
   task-oriented information value measurement. This framework integrates
   IVT with the space-time prism from time geography and measures the value
   of information based on its impact on an individual's space-time prisms
   and its capability of improving task planning. We develop and formalize
   this framework by extending the utility function from space-time
   accessibility studies and elaborate it using a simplified example from
   time geography. We conduct a simulation on a real-world transportation
   network using the proposed framework. Our research could be applied to
   improving information display on small-screen mobile devices (e.g.,
   smartwatches) by assigning priorities to different information items.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an artificial immune algorithm (IA) combined with
   estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), named IA-EDA, for the
   traveling salesman problem (TSP). Two components are incorporated in
   IA-EDA to further improve the performance of the conventional IA. First,
   aiming to strengthen the information exchange during different
   solutions, two kinds of EDAs involving univariate marginal distribution
   algorithm and population-based incremental learning are altered based on
   the permutation representation of TSP. It is expected that new promising
   candidate solutions can be sampled from the constructed probabilistic
   model of EDA. Second, a heuristic refinement local search operator is
   proposed to repair the infeasible solutions sampled by EDA. Therefore,
   IA-EDA can alleviate the deficiencies of the conventional IA and can
   find better solutions for TSP by well balancing the exploitation and
   exploration of the search. Experiments are conducted based on a number
   of benchmark instances with size up to 100 000 cities. Simulation
   results show that IA-EDA is effective for improving the performance of
   the conventional IA and can produce better or competitive solutions than
   other hybrid algorithms. (C) 2016 Institute of Electrical Engineers of

Abstract = {{Object detecting and tracking is an important technique used in diverse
   applications of machine vision, and has made great progress with the
   prevalence of artificial intelligence technology, among which the
   detecting and tracking moving object under dynamic scenes is more
   challenging for high requirements on real-time performance and
   reliability. Essentially analyzing, object detecting and tracking need
   to classify the objects and background into two different categories
   according to different features, where the detecting and tracking drift
   caused by noisy background can be effectively handled by robust maximum
   margin classifier, such as one-class SVM. But the time and space
   complexities of traditional one-class SVM methods tend to be high, which
   limits its wide applications to various fields. Inspired by the idea
   proposed by Support Vector Data Description (SVDD), in this paper we
   present a novel SVDD-based algorithm to efficiently deal with detecting
   and tracking moving object under dynamic scenes. The experimental
   results on synthetic, benchmark data and real-world videos demonstrate
   the competitive performances of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents improvements in Direct Torque control of induction
   motor using Fuzzy logic switching controller (FDTC). The conventional
   DTC (CDTC) and FDTC drive performance is compared using Conventional PI,
   Fuzzy controller and Neural Network controllers. The major disadvantages
   of CDTC are high torque and flux ripples in steady state operation of
   the drive, inferior performance at low speed operation and variable
   switching frequency. The presence of hysteresis bands is the major
   reason for high torque and flux ripples in CDTC. In FDTC the hysteresis
   band and switching table are replaced by Fuzzy logic switching
   controller. Using fuzzy logic torque, stator flux space are divided into
   smaller subsections which results in precise and optimal selection of
   switching state to meet load torque. In high performance drives accurate
   tuning of PI speed controller is required. The conventional PI
   controller cannot adapt to the variation in model parameters. Artificial
   intelligence based fuzzy controller and neural network controller are
   compared with PI controller for both CDTC and FDTC of Induction machine.
   The proposed schemes are developed in Matlab/Simulink environment.
   Simulation results shows reduction in torque and flux ripples in FDTC
   and dynamic performance of the drive at low speeds and sudden change in
   load torque can be improved using Fuzzy logic controller compared to PI
   and neural network controller.}},

Abstract = {{Future smart grids will require an observable, controllable and flexible
   network architecture for reliable and efficient energy delivery. The use
   of artificial intelligence and advanced communication technologies is
   essential in building a fully automated system. This paper introduces a
   new technique for online optimal operation of distributed generation
   (DG) resources, i.e. a hybrid fuel cell (FC) and photovoltaic (PV)
   system for residential applications. The proposed technique aims to
   minimize the total daily operating cost of a group of residential homes
   by managing the operation of embedded DG units remotely from a control
   centre. The target is formed as an objective function that is solved
   using genetic algorithm (GA) optimization technique. The optimal
   settings of the DG units obtained from the optimization process are sent
   to each DG unit through a fully automated system. The results show that
   the proposed technique succeeded in defining the optimal operating
   points of the DGs that affect directly the total operating cost of the

Abstract = {{Tool condition monitoring (TCM) is a necessary action in a high-speed
   milling (HSM) process. As a worn milling tool might irreversibly damage
   a workpiece, there is a vital demand for a TCM system to evaluate the
   tool wear progress, or equivalently the resultant surface roughness,
   nonintrusively. To build up a condition monitoring system for HSM
   processes, sensor signals are to be utilized to form a reference model
   that reflects the performance of the system. Therefore, a desired
   reference model has to apply more efficient feature extraction and
   artificial intelligence techniques to be more repeatable and
   generalizable. This paper illustrates the performance of clustering
   techniques on high-speed end milling experimental data. Studied
   clustering methods are applied to the wavelet features of force and
   vibration signals to illustrate the repeatability of their results. It
   is shown that clustering methods can coarsely capture the status of the
   process and can be applied for fault diagnosis and TCM purposes. It is
   also discussed how the application of clustering methods may improve the
   performance of existing reference models toward the more efficient
   utilization of available experimental data and to develop easily
   generalizable reference models. Finally, a possible application of
   clustering results is discussed comparing with state-of-the-art papers.}},

   - object relations which makes possible the recognition of complex
   strawberry features under changing conditions of lightning, size and
   orientation. The programming uses OpenCV libraries and fruits databases
   captured with a webcam. The images used to train the Artificial Neural
   Network are defined with canny edge detection and a moving region of

   features such as shape, color and anomalies. The system has been tested

Abstract = {{Advances in the development of technology have led to microrobots
   applications in medical fields. Drug delivery is one of these
   applications in which microrobots deliver a pharmaceutical compound to
   targeted cells. Chemotherapy and its side effects can then be minimized
   by this method. Two major constraints, however, must be considered: the
   robot's onboard energy supply and the time needed for drug delivery.
   Furthermore, a microrobot must avoid biological restricted areas which
   we treat as obstacles in the path. The main objectives of this work were
   to find optimal paths to targeted cells and avoid collision with
   obstacles in the paths under a dynamic environment. In this study, we
   controlled motion of microrobots based on the concept of swarm
   intelligence. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), the Best-so-far ABC, and the
   Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods were employed to implement the
   collision detection and the boundary distance detection modules. Forces
   that drove or resisted blood flow as well as pressure in blood vessels
   were considered to approximate the effects of the environment on the
   microrobots. Numerical experiments were conducted using various obstacle
   environments. The results con firm that the proposed approaches were
   successful in avoiding obstacles and optimizing the energy consumption
   used to reach the target.}},

Abstract = {{Swarm intelligence algorithms are amongst the most efficient approaches
   toward solving optimization problems. Up to now, most of swarm
   intelligence approaches have been proposed for optimization in static
   environments. However, numerous real-world problems are dynamic which
   could not be solved using static approaches. In this paper, a novel
   approach based on artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) has been
   proposed for optimization in dynamic environments in which changes in
   the problem space occur in discrete intervals. The proposed algorithm
   can quickly find the peaks in the problem space and track them after an
   environment change. In this algorithm, artificial fish swarms are
   responsible for finding and tracking peaks and several behaviors and
   mechanisms are employed to cope with the dynamic environment. Extensive
   experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms
   previous algorithms in most of tested dynamic environments modeled by
   moving peaks benchmark.}},

Abstract = {{Animal grouping behaviors have been widely studied due to their
   implications for understanding social intelligence, collective
   cognition, and potential applications in engineering, artificial
   intelligence, and robotics. An important biological aspect of these
   studies is discerning which selection pressures favor the evolution of
   grouping behavior. In the past decade, researchers have begun using
   evolutionary computation to study the evolutionary effects of these
   selection pressures in predator-prey models. The selfish herd hypothesis
   states that concentrated groups arise because prey selfishly attempt to
   place their conspecifics between themselves and the predator, thus
   causing an endless cycle of movement toward the center of the group.
   Using an evolutionary model of a predatorprey system, we show that how
   predators attack is critical to the evolution of the selfish herd.
   Following this discovery, we show that density-dependent predation
   provides an abstraction of Hamilton ` s original formulation of domains
   of danger. Finally, we verify that density-dependent predation provides
   a sufficient selective advantage for prey to evolve the selfish herd in
   response to predation by coevolving predators. Thus, our work
   corroborates Hamilton ` s selfish herd hypothesis in a digital
   evolutionary model, refines the assumptions of the selfish herd
   hypothesis, and generalizes the domain of danger concept to
   density-dependent predation.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, two approaches are proposed and compared for the
   detection and identification of aircraft subsystem failures based on the
   artificial immune system paradigm combined with the hierarchical
   multiself strategy. The first approach relies on the heuristic ranking
   of lower order self/non-self projections and the generation of selective
   immunity identifiers through structuring of the non-self. The second
   approach is based on an information processing algorithm inspired by the
   functionality of the dendritic cells. The artificial dendritic cell is
   defined as a computational unit that centralizes, fuses, and interprets
   information from the multiple selves to produce a unique detection and
   identification outcome. A hierarchical multi-self strategy is used with
   both approaches considering 2-dimensional self/non-self projections or
   subselves. A mathematical formulation of the concepts and detailed
   implementation algorithms are presented. The proposed methodologies are
   demonstrated and compared using simulation data for a supersonic fighter
   from a motion-based flight simulator at nominal conditions, under
   failures of actuators, malfunction of sensors, and wing damage. In all
   cases considered, both detection and identification schemes achieve
   excellent detection and identification rates with practically no false
   alarms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hadiths are important textual sources of law, tradition, and teaching in
   the Islamic world. Analyzing the unique linguistic features of Hadiths
   (e.g. ancient Arabic language and story-like text) results to compile
   and utilize specific natural language processing methods. In the
   literature, no study is solely focused on Hadith from artificial
   intelligence perspective, while many new developments have been
   overlooked and need to be highlighted. Therefore, this review analyze
   all academic journal and conference publications that using two main
   methods of artificial intelligence for Hadith text: Hadith
   classification and mining. All Hadith relevant methods and algorithms
   from the literature are discussed and analyzed in terms of
   functionality, simplicity, F-score and accuracy. Using various different
   Hadith datasets makes a direct comparison between the evaluation results
   impossible. Therefore, we have re-implemented and evaluated the methods
   using a single dataset (i.e. 3150 Hadiths from Sahih Al-Bukhari book).
   The result of evaluation on the classification method reveals that
   neural networks classify the Hadith with 94\% accuracy. This is because
   neural networks are capable of handling complex (high dimensional) input
   data. The Hadith mining method that combines vector space model, Cosine
   similarity, and enriched queries obtains the best accuracy result (i.e.
   88\%) among other re-evaluated Hadith mining methods. The most important
   aspect in Hadith mining methods is query expansion since the query must
   be fitted to the Hadith lingo. The lack of knowledge based methods is
   evident in Hadith classification and mining approaches and this absence
   can be covered in future works using knowledge graphs.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In the DSTATCOM controlled distribution feeders, the DC capacitor
   voltage balancing plays an imperative role to regulate the voltage at
   Point of Common Coupling (PCC). To perform faster compensation using
   this device, the load current has to be tracked accurately. Further, the
   dc capacitor voltage has to be maintained constant for perfect current
   tracking. The de capacitor voltage is generally regulated with the use
   of conventional PI controller. In this study, two types of controllers
   have been proposed viz., fuzzy tuned PI controller and a Brain Emotional
   Learning Based Intelligent Controller (BELBIC). Apart from dc capacitor
   voltage regulation, these controllers improve the transient performance
   of the capacitor voltage as well. The DSTATCOM controlled distribution
   system taken up for study is modeled with a non linear load and an
   unbalanced load. As far as the reference currents of this system are
   concerned, they are generated using instantaneous symmetrical component
   theory. For performance comparison, the response of the system is
   obtained with fuzzy tuned PI controller and BELBIC controller. The
   simulated results validates that the BELBIC controller exhibits superior
   performance characteristics than the conventional PI and the fuzzy tuned
   PI controller. The control algorithm is evaluated using DSP (dSPACE
   1104) and the results are studied under unbalanced non linear load
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Heart disease is the major cause of death as well as a leading cause of
   disability in the developed countries; Mitral Regurgitation (MR) is a
   common heart disease which does not cause symptoms until its end stage.
   Therefore, early diagnosis of the disease is of crucial importance in
   the treatment process. Echocardiography is a common method of diagnosis
   in the severity of MR. Hence, a method which is based on
   echocardiography videos, image processing techniques and artificial
   intelligence could be helpful for clinicians, especially in borderline
   cases. In this paper, we introduce novel features to detect
   micro-patterns of echocardiography images in order to determine the
   severity of MR. Extensive Local Binary Pattern (ELBP) and Extensive
   Volume Local Binary Pattern (EVLBP) are presented as image descriptors
   which include details from different viewpoints of the heart in feature
   vectors. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis
   (LDA) and Template Matching techniques are used as classifiers to
   determine the severity of MR based on textural descriptors. The SVM
   classifier with Extensive Uniform Local Binary Pattern (ELBPU) and
   Extensive Volume Local Binary Pattern (EVLBP) have the best accuracy
   with 99.52\%, 99.38\%, 99.31\% and 99.59\%, respectively, for the
   detection, of Normal, Mild MR, Moderate MR and Severe MR subjects among
   echocardiography videos. The proposed method achieves 99.38\%
   sensitivity and 99.63\% specificity for the detection of the severity of
   MR and normal subjects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Extracting medical knowledge by structured data mining of many medical
   records and from unstructured data mining of natural language source
   text on the Internet will become increasingly important for clinical
   decision support. Output from these sources can be transformed into
   large numbers of elements of knowledge in a Knowledge Representation
   Store (KRS), here using the notation and to some extent the algebraic
   principles of the Q-UEL Web-based universal exchange and inference
   language described previously, rooted in Dirac notation from quantum
   mechanics and linguistic theory. In a KRS, semantic structures or
   statements about the world of interest to medicine are analogous to
   natural language sentences seen as formed from noun phrases separated by
   verbs, prepositions and other descriptions of relationships. A
   convenient method of testing and better curating these elements of
   knowledge is by having the computer use them to take the test of a
   multiple choice medical licensing examination. It is a venture which
   perhaps tells us almost as much about the reasoning of students and
   examiners as it does about the requirements for Artificial Intelligence
   as employed in clinical decision making. It emphasizes the role of
   context and of contextual probabilities as opposed to the more familiar
   intrinsic probabilities, and of a preliminary form of logic that we call
   presyllogistic reasoning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial neural networks (ANNs), a branch of artificial intelligence,
   has become a very interesting domain since the eighties when
   back-propagation (BP) learning algorithm for multilayer feed-forward
   architecture was introduced to solve nonlinear problems. It is used
   extensively to solve complex nonalgorithmic problems such as prediction,
   pattern recognition and clustering. However, in the context of a
   holistic study, there may be a need to integrate ANN with other models
   developed in various paradigms to solve a problem. In this paper, we
   suggest discrete event system specification (DEVS) be used as a model of
   computation (MoC) to make ANN models interoperable with other models
   (since all discrete event models can be expressed in DEVS, and
   continuous models can be approximated by DEVS). By combining ANN and
   DEVS, we can model the complex configuration of ANNs and express its
   internal workings. Therefore, we are extending the DEVS-based ANN
   proposed by Toma et al. {[}A new DEVS-based generic artficial neural
   network modeling approach, The 23rd European Modeling and Simulation
   Symp. (Simulation in Industry), Rome, Italy, 2011] for comparing
   multiple configuration parameters and learning algorithms and also to do
   prediction. The DEVS models are described using the high level language
   for system specification (HiLLS), {[}Maiga et al., A new approach to
   modeling dynamic structure systems, The 29th European Modeling and
   Simulation Symp. (Simulation in Industry), Leicester, United Kingdom,
   2015] a graphical modeling language for clarity. The developed platform
   is a tool to transform ANN models into DEVS computational models, making

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on our entry for the AI Birds competition,
   where we designed, implemented, and evaluated an agent for the physics
   puzzle computer game Angry Birds. Our agent uses search and simulation
   to find appropriate parameters for launching birds. While there are
   other methods that focus on qualitative reasoning about physical systems
   we try to combine simulation and adjustable abstractions to efficiently
   traverse the possibly infinite search space. The agent features a
   hierarchical search scheme where different levels of abstractions are
   used. At any level, it uses simulation to rate subspaces that should be
   further explored in more detail on the next levels. We evaluate single
   components of our agent and we also compare the overall performance of
   different versions of our agent. We show that our approach yields a
   competitive solution on the standard set of levels.}},

   when introducing artificial intelligence in a physics-based game are
   dealt with a combination of traditional imperative programming and
   declarative programming, used for modeling discrete knowledge about the
   game and the current situation. In particular, we make use of HEX

Abstract = {{Angry Birds is a popular video game in which a set of birds has to
   perform sling shots (bird shots) so as to kill pigs that are protected

   use and the more blocks we destroy, the higher the score we achieve.
   AIBirds competition is an AI challenge where an intelligent bot has to
   be developed that plays the game without human intervention. In this
   paper, we describe the approach implemented in the bot, s-birds
   Avengers, that participated in ECAI AIBirds 2014. Heuristic techniques
   were designed to analyze unseen structures using various structural
   parameters and then to discover their vulnerable points using prior
   parameter learning training algorithm. The bot then uses this to decide
   where to hit the structure with the birds.}},

Abstract = {{Today's physics engines mainly simulate classical mechanics and rigid
   body dynamics, with some late advances also capable of simulating
   massive particle systems and some approximations of fluid dynamics. An
   accurate numerical simulation of complex nonmechanical processes in real
   time is beyond the state of the art in the respective fields. This paper
   illustrates an alternative approach to a purely numerical solution. It
   uses a semantic representation of physical properties and processes as
   well as a reasoning engine to model cause and effect between objects,
   based on their material properties. Classical collision detection is
   combined with semantic rules to model various physical processes, for
   example, in the areas of thermodynamics, electrodynamics, and fluid
   dynamics as well as chemical processes. Each process is broken down into
   fine-grained subprocesses capable of approximating continuous
   transitions with discretized state changes. Our system applies these
   high-level state descriptions to low-level value changes, which are
   directly mapped to a graphical representation of the scene. We
   demonstrate our framework's ability to support multiple complex,
   causally connected physical and chemical processes by simulating a
   Goldberg machine. Our performance benchmarks validate its scalability
   and potential application for entertainment or edutainment purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Games with continuous state and action spaces present unique challenges
   from an artificial intelligence (AI) viewpoint. Billiards, or pool, is
   one such domain that has been the focus of several research efforts
   aimed at designing AI agents to play successfully. Due to the continuous
   nature of the actions, it is natural to believe that the more time an
   agent has to investigate actions, the better it will perform. This paper
   gives a thorough description of a successful agent with a novel
   distributed architecture, designed for being able to grant further time
   for shot simulation and analysis through the utilization of many CPUs. A
   brief analysis of the distributed component of the agent is presented,
   as well as how much the extra time thus obtained contributed to its
   success, especially when compared to its other novel components. The
   described agent, CUECARD, won the Computer Olympiad computational pool
   tournament held in 2008.}},

Abstract = {{The field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) has undergone
   significant developments over the last twenty-five years. As we reflect
   on our past and shape our future, we ask two main questions: What are
   our major strengths? And, what new opportunities lay on the horizon? We
   analyse 47 papers from three years in the history of the Journal of AIED
   (1994, 2004, and 2014) to identify the foci and typical scenarios that
   occupy the field of AIED. We use those results to suggest two parallel
   strands of research that need to take place in order to impact education
   in the next 25 years: One is an evolutionary process, focusing on
   current classroom practices, collaborating with teachers, and
   diversifying technologies and domains. The other is a revolutionary
   process where we argue for embedding our technologies within students'
   everyday lives, supporting their cultures, practices, goals, and

Abstract = {{This article offers a vision for technology supported collaborative and
   discussion-based learning at scale. It begins with historical work in
   the area of tutorial dialogue systems. It traces the history of that
   area of the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education as it has made
   an impact on the field of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning
   through the creation of forms of dynamic support for collaborative
   learning, and makes an argument for the importance of advances in the
   field of Language Technologies for this work. In particular, this
   support has been enabled by an integration of text mining and
   conversational agents to form a novel type of micro-script support for
   productive discussion processes. This research from the early part of
   the century has paved the way for emerging technologies that support
   discussion-based learning at scale in Massive Open Online Courses
   (MOOCs). In the next 25 years, we expect to see this early, emerging
   work in MOOC contexts grow into ubiquitously available social learning
   approaches in free online learning environments like MOOCs, or what
   comes next in the online learning space. These ambitious social learning
   approaches include Problem Based Learning, Team Project Based Learning,
   and Collaborative Reflection. We expect to see the capability of drawing
   in and effectively supporting learners of all walks of life, especially
   impacting currently under-served learners. To that end, we describe the
   current exploratory efforts to deploy technology supported collaborative
   and discussion-based learning in MOOCs and offer a vision for work going
   forward into the next decade, where we envision learning communities and
   open collaborative work communities coming together as persistent
   technology supported and enhanced communities of practice.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes that the field of AIED is now mature enough to break
   away from being delivered mainly through computers and pads so that it
   can engage with students in new ways and help teachers to teach more
   effectively. Mostly, the intelligent systems that AIED has delivered so
   far have used computers and other devices that were essentially designed
   for businesses or personal use, and not specifically for education. The
   future holds the promise of creating technologies designed specifically
   for learning and teaching by combining the power of AIED with advances
   in the field of robotics and in the increasing use of sensor devices to
   monitor our surroundings and actions. The paper assumes that
   ``schools{''} (i.e., a place where children will gather to learn) will
   still exist in some shape or form in 25 years and that teachers will
   continue to oversee and promote learning among the students. It proposes
   that there will be educational cobots assisting teachers in the
   classrooms of tomorrow and provides examples from current work in
   robotics. It also envisions smart classrooms that make use of sensors to
   support learning and illustrates how they might be used in new ways if
   AIED applications are embedded into them.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that the research field of Artificial Intelligence in
   Education (AIED) can benefit from integrating recent technological
   advances (e.g., wearable devices, big data processing, 3D modelling, 3D
   printing, ambient intelligence) and design methodologies, such as
   TORMES, when developing systems that address the psychomotor learning
   domain. In particular, the acquisition of motor skills could benefit
   from individualized instruction and support just as cognitive skills
   learning has over the last decades. To this point, procedural learning
   has been considered since the earliest days of AIED (dating back to the
   1980's). However, AIED developments in motor skills learning have lagged
   significantly behind. As technology has evolved, and supported by the
   do-it-yourself and quantified-self movements, it is now possible to
   integrate emerging interactive technologies in order to provide personal
   awareness and reflection for behavioural change at low cost and with low
   intrusion. Many activities exist that would benefit from personalizing
   motor skills learning, such as playing a musical instrument,
   handwriting, drawing, training for surgery, improving the technique in
   sports and martial arts, learning sign language, dancing, etc. In this
   context, my suggestions for AIED research in the coming 25 years focus
   on addressing challenges regarding 1) modelling the psychomotor
   interaction, and 2) providing appropriate personalized psychomotor
   support.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced learning technologies are reaching a new phase of their
   evolution where they are finally entering mainstream educational
   contexts, with persistent user bases. However, as AIED scales, it will
   need to follow recent trends in service-oriented and ubiquitous
   computing: breaking AIED platforms into distinct services that can be
   composed for different platforms (web, mobile, etc.) and distributed
   across multiple systems. This will represent a move from learning
   platforms to an ecosystem of interacting learning tools. Such tools will
   enable new opportunities for both user-adaptation and experimentation.
   Traditional macro-adaptation (problem selection) and step`-based
   adaptation (hints and feedback) will be extended by meta-adaptation
   (adaptive system selection) and micro-adaptation (event-level
   optimization). The existence of persistent and widely-used systems will
   also support new paradigms for experimentation in education, allowing
   researchers to understand interactions and boundary conditions for
   learning principles. New central research questions for the field will
   also need to be answered due to these changes in the AIED landscape.}},

Abstract = {{This essay imagines the role that artificial intelligence innovations
   play in the integrated living, learning and research environments of
   2041. Here, in 2041, in the context of increasingly complex wicked
   challenges, whose solutions by their very nature continue to evade even
   the most capable experts, society and technology have co-evolved to
   embrace cyberlearning as an essential tool for envisioning and refining
   utopias-non-existent societies described in considerable detail. Our
   society appreciates that evolving these utopias is critical to creating
   and resolving wicked challenges and to better understanding how to
   create a world in which we are actively ``learning to be{''} deeply
   engaged in intrinsically motivating experiences that empower each of us
   to reach our full potential. Since 2015, Artificial Intelligence in
   Education (AIED) has transitioned from what was primarily a research
   endeavour, with educational impact involving millions of user/learners,
   to serving, now, as a core contributor to democratizing learning (Dewey
   2004) and active citizenship for all (billions of learners throughout
   their lives). An expansive experiential super computing cyberlearning
   environment, we affectionately call the ``Holodeck,{''} supports
   transdisciplinary collaboration and integrated education, research, and
   innovation, providing a networked software/hardware infrastructure that
   synthesizes visual, audio, physical, social, and societal components.
   The Holodeck's large-scale integration of learning, research, and
   innovation, through real-world problem solving and teaching others what
   you have learned, effectively creates a global meritocratic network with
   the potential to resolve society's wicked challenges while empowering
   every citizen to realize her or his full potential.}},

Title = {{Deep learning for estimating building energy consumption}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{91-99}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{To improve the design of the electricity infrastructure and the
   efficient deployment of distributed and renewable energy sources, a new
   paradigm for the energy supply chain is emerging, leading to the
   development of smart grids. There is a need to add intelligence at all
   levels in the grid, acting over various time horizons. Predicting the
   behavior of the energy system is crucial to mitigate potential
   uncertainties. An accurate energy prediction at the customer level will
   reflect directly in efficiency improvements in the whole system.
   However, prediction of building energy consumption is complex due to
   many influencing factors, such as climate, performance of thermal
   systems, and occupancy patterns. Therefore, current state-of-the-art
   methods are not able to confine the uncertainty at the building level
   due to the many fluctuations in influencing variables. As an evolution
   of artificial neural network (ANN)-based prediction methods, deep
   learning techniques are expected to increase the prediction accuracy by
   allowing higher levels of abstraction. In this paper, we investigate two
   newly developed stochastic models for time series prediction of energy
   consumption, namely Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM) and
   Factored Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (FCRBM). The
   assessment is made on a benchmark dataset consisting of almost four
   years of one minute resolution electric power consumption data collected
   from an individual residential customer. The results show that for the
   energy prediction problem solved here, FCRBM outperforms ANN, Support
   Vector Machine (SVM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and CRBM. (C) 2016

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{111-119}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The popularity of face recognition systems have increased due to their
   use in widespread applications. Driven by the enormous number of
   potential application domains, several algorithms have been proposed for
   face recognition. Face pose and image resolutions are among the two
   important factors that influence the performance of face recognition
   algorithms. In this study, the authors present a comparative study of
   three baseline face recognition algorithms to analyse the effects of two
   aforementioned factors. The algorithms studied include (a) the adaptive
   boosting (AdaBoost) with linear discriminant analysis as weak learner,
   (b) the principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach, and (c) the
   local binary pattern (LBP)-based approach. They perform an empirical
   study using the images with systematic pose variation and resolution
   from multi-pose, illumination, and expression database to explore the
   recognition accuracy. This evaluation is useful for practical
   applications because most engineers start development of a face
   recognition application using these baseline algorithms. Simulation
   results revealed that the PCA is more accurate in classifying the pose
   variation, whereas the AdaBoost is more robust in identifying
   low-resolution images. The LBP does not classify face images of size 20
   x 20 pixels and below and has lower recognition accuracy than PCA and
   AdaBoost.}},

Abstract = {{Swarm Intelligence (SI) is quite popular in the field of numerical
   optimization and has enormous scope for research. A number of algorithms
   based on decentralized and self-orgariized swarm behavior of natural as
   well as artificial systems have been proposed and developed in last few
   years. Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO) algorithm, inspired by the
   intelligent behavior of spider monkeys, is one such recently proposed
   algorithm. The algorithm along with some of its variants has proved to
   be very successful and efficient.
   A spider monkey group consists of members from every age group. The
   agility and swiftness of the spider monkeys differ on the basis of their
   age groups. This paper proposes a new variant of SMO algorithm termed as
   Ageist Spider Monkey Optimization (ASMO) algorithm which seems more
   practical in biological terms and works on the basis of age difference
   present in spider monkey population. Experiments on different benchmark
   functions with different parameters and settings have been carried out
   and the variant with the best suited settings is proposed. This variant
   of SMO has enhanced the performance of its original version. Also, ASMO
   has performed better in comparison to some of the recent advanced
   algorithms. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Prediction based mean-variance model for constrained portfolio assets
   selection using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms}},
Journal = {{SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel prediction based mean-variance (PBMV) model has
   been proposed, as an alternative to the conventional Markowitz
   mean-variance model, to solve the constrained portfolio optimization
   problem. In the Markowitz mean-variance model, the expected future
   return is taken as the mean of the past returns, which is incorrect. In
   the proposed model, first the expected future returns are predicted,
   using a low complexity heuristic functional link artificial neural
   network (HFLANN) model and the portfolio optimization task is carried
   out by using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). In this
   paper, swarm intelligence based, multiobjective optimization algorithm,
   namely self-regulating multiobjective particle swarm optimization
   (SR-MOPSO) has also been proposed and employed efficiently to solve this
   important problem. The Pareto solutions obtained by applying two other
   competitive MOEAs and using the proposed PBMV models and Markowitz
   mean-variance model have been compared, considering six performance
   metrics and the Pareto fronts. Moreover, in the present study, the
   nonparametric statistical analysis using the Sign test and Wilcoxon rank
   test are also carried out, to compare the performance of the algorithms
   pair wise. It is observed that, the proposed PBMV model based approach
   provides better Pareto solutions, maintaining adequate diversity, and
   also quite comparable to the Markowitz model. From the simulation
   result, it is observed that the self regulating multiobjective particle
   swarm optimization (SR-MOPSO) algorithm based on PBMV model, provides
   the best Pareto solutions amongst those offered by other MOEAs. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this study, a bio-inspired computing approach is developed to solve
   Bratu-type equations arising in modeling of electrically conducting
   solids and various other physical phenomena. We employ feed-forward
   artificial neural networks (ANN) optimized with genetic algorithm (GA)
   and the active-set method (ASM). The mathematical formulation consists
   of an ANN with an unsupervised error, which is minimized by tuning
   weights of the network. The evolutionary technique based on GAs is used
   as a tool for global search of the weights in conjunction with the ASM
   for rapid local convergence. The designed methodology is applied to
   solve a number of initial and boundary value problems based on Bratu
   equations. Monte Carlo simulations and their statistical analyses are
   used to validate accuracy, convergence and effectiveness of the scheme.
   Comparison of results is made with exact solutions, the fully explicit
   Runge-Kutta numerical method, and other reported solutions of analytical
   and numerical solvers to establish correctness of the designed scheme.

Abstract = {{Surrogate model methods are attractive ways to improve the efficiency of
   Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) for structural reliability analysis. An
   intelligent surrogate model based method for slope system reliability
   analysis is presented in this study. The novel machine learning
   technique nu-support vector machine (nu-SVM) is adopted to establish the
   surrogate model to predict the factor of safety via the samples
   generated by Latin hypercube sampling. Global optimization algorithms
   particle swarm optimization and artificial bee colony algorithm are
   adopted to select the hyper-parameters of nu-SVM model. The
   applicability of the nu-SVM based surrogate model for slope system
   reliability analysis is tested on four examples with obvious system
   effects. It is found that the proposed surrogate model combined with MCS
   can achieve accurate system failure probability evaluation using fewer
   deterministic slope stability analyzes than other approaches. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Developing a computational model for studying tribological performance
   is essential for computing accurate life cycle of various materials.
   Caused by the existence of complicated and nonlinear interactions
   between material surfaces, exact modeling of wear behavior is very
   difficult. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in distinguishing
   similar patterns in experimental data and predictive modeling of a
   certain material's wear behavior. In this paper, artificial neural
   networks (ANNs) approach, adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system
   (ANFIS) technique, and fuzzy clustering method (FCM) are used to develop
   a simple, accurate, and applicable model for predicting the wear
   behavior of sinter-hardened steel parts. Three different cooling rates
   (0.5, 2, and 3 A degrees C/s) were applied on six specimens made out of
   pre-alloyed Astaloy 85 Mo and Distaloy AB powders by powder metallurgy
   (PM) method. Reciprocating dry sliding wear tests were carried out on
   these specimens with three different loads. The empirical results were
   assorted in two different batches. One was used along with the mentioned
   artificial intelligence approaches to develop three wear behavior
   models. In order to verify and compare these models, predicted results
   gained from these models were compared to the second batch of the
   results. Outcome of the models were promising. Using magnitude of two
   statistical functions, root-mean squared error and coefficient of
   multiple determinations, we showed that our predictions are in great
   correlation with experimental data and the best performance can be
   obtained using ANN method.}},

Abstract = {{In recent times, wireless access technology is becoming increasingly
   commonplace due to the ease of operation and installation of untethered
   wireless media. The design of wireless networking is challenging due to
   the highly dynamic environmental condition that makes parameter
   optimization a complex task. Due to the dynamic, and often unknown,
   operating conditions, modern wireless networking standards increasingly
   rely on machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. Genetic
   algorithms (GAs) provide a well-established framework for implementing
   artificial intelligence tasks such as classification, learning, and
   optimization. GAs are well known for their remarkable generality and
   versatility and have been applied in a wide variety of settings in
   wireless networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of
   the applications of GAs in wireless networks. We provide both an
   exposition of common GA models and configuration and provide a
   broad-ranging survey of GA techniques in wireless networks. We also
   point out open research issues and define potential future work. While
   various surveys on GAs exist in the literature, our paper is the first

   Ada was worldwide celebrated on December 10th 2015, on the occasion of
   her 200th birthday, with workshops, meetings, and publications. In
   particular, ACM contributed with a book: an interdisciplinary collection
   of papers inspired by Ada's life, work, and legacy. The book covers
   Ada's collaboration with Babbage, her position in the Victorian and
   steampunk literature, her representation in contemporary art and comics,
   and her increasing relevance in promoting women in science and
   technology.
   I here review the book, focusing in particular on Ada's visionary ideas
   of software, on her relation with Alan Turing and the inception of
   Artificial Intelligence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{235}},
Pages = {{63-94}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{There is a long history in game theory on the topic of Bayesian or
   ``rational{''} learning, in which each player maintains beliefs over a
   set of alternative behaviours, or types, for the other players. This
   idea has gained increasing interest in the artificial intelligence (AI)
   community, where it is used as a method to control a single agent in a
   system composed of multiple agents with unknown behaviours. The idea is
   to hypothesise a set of types, each specifying a possible behaviour for
   the other agents, and to plan our own actions with respect to those
   types which we believe are most likely, given the observed actions of
   the agents. The game theory literature studies this idea primarily in
   the context of equilibrium attainment. In contrast, many Al applications
   have a focus on task completion and payoff maximisation. With this
   perspective in mind, we identify and address a spectrum of questions
   pertaining to belief and truth in hypothesised types. We formulate three
   basic ways to incorporate evidence into posterior beliefs and show when
   the resulting beliefs are correct, and when they may fail to be correct.
   Moreover, we demonstrate that prior beliefs can have a significant
   impact on our ability to maximise payoffs in the long-term, and that
   they can be computed automatically with consistent performance effects.
   Furthermore, we analyse the conditions under which we are able complete
   our task optimally, despite inaccuracies in the hypothesised types.
   Finally, we show how the correctness of hypothesised types can be
   ascertained during the interaction via an automated statistical
   analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a smart fault detection, classification and location
   (SFDCL) methodology for transmission systems with multi-generators using
   discrete orthogonal Stockwell transform (DOST). The methodology is based
   on synchronized current measurements from remote telemetry units (RTUs)

   extracted from the transient current signals due to occurrence of
   different types of faults using DOST are being utilized for real-time
   fault detection and classification. Support vector machine (SVM) has
   been deployed for locating the fault distance using the extracted
   coefficients. A comparative study is performed for establishing the
   superiority of SVM over other popular computational intelligence
   methods, such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and
   artificial neural network (ANN), for more precise and reliable
   estimation of fault distance. The results corroborate the effectiveness
   of the suggested SFDCL algorithm for real-time transmission line fault

Abstract = {{Nowadays, there is increasing interest in the development of teamwork
   skills in the educational context. This growing interest is motivated by
   its pedagogical effectiveness and the fact that, in labour contexts,
   enterprises organise their employees in teams to carry out complex
   projects. Despite its crucial importance in the classroom and industry,
   there is a lack of support for the team formation process. Not only do
   many factors influence team performance, but the problem becomes
   exponentially costly if teams are to be optimised. In this article, we
   propose a tool whose aim it is to cover such a gap. It combines
   artificial intelligence techniques such as coalition structure
   generation, Bayesian learning, and Belbin's role theory to facilitate
   the generation of working groups in an educational context. This tool
   improves current state of the art proposals in three ways: i) it takes
   into account the feedback of other teammates in order to establish the
   most predominant role of a student instead of self-perception
   questionnaires; ii) it handles uncertainty with regard to each student's
   predominant team role; iii) it is iterative since it considers
   information from several interactions in order to improve the estimation
   of role assignments. We tested the performance of the proposed tool in
   an experiment involving students that took part in three different team
   activities. The experiments suggest that the proposed tool is able to
   improve different teamwork aspects such as team dynamics and student
   satisfaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Linked Open Data (LOD) has gained widespread adoption by large
   industries as well as non-profit organizations and governmental
   organizations. One of the early adopters of LOD technologies are
   libraries. Since the ``early years{''}, libraries have been key use case
   and innovation driver for LOD and significantly contributed to the
   adoption of semantic technologies. The first part of this paper presents
   selected success stories of current activities in the Linked Data
   Library community. In a nutshell, these studies include (1) a
   conceptualization of the Linked Data Value chain, (2) a case study for
   consumption of Linked Data in a digital journal environment, and (3) an
   approach to publish metadata on the Semantic Web from an Open Access
   repository. These stories reveal a strong relationship between LOD in
   libraries and research topics addressed in traditional fields of
   computer science such as artificial intelligence, databases, and
   knowledge discovery. Thus, in the second part of this paper we
   systematically review the relation of LOD in digital libraries from a
   computer science perspective. We discuss current LOD research topics
   such as data integration and schema integration, distributed data
   management, and others. These challenges have been discussed with
   computer scientists at a German national database meetup as well as with
   librarians from ZBW-Leibniz Information Center for Economics and at
   international librarians meetup.}},

   constructed to obtain the best representations. Two statistical
   performance criteria of mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of

Title = {{Using computational intelligence to forecast carbon prices}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{107-116}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{European Union has introduced the European Trading System (ETS) as a
   tool for developing and implementing international treaties related to
   climate changes and to identify the most cost-effective methods for
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in particular carbon dioxide (CO2),
   which is the most substantial. Companies producing carbon emissions must
   effectively manage associated costs by buying or selling carbon emission
   futures. Viewed from this perspective, this paper provides a model for
   managing the risk by buying and selling carbon emission futures by
   implementing techniques that leverage computational intelligence. Three
   computational intelligence techniques are proposed to provide accurate
   and timely forecasts for changes in the price of carbon: a novel hybrid
   neuro-fuzzy controller that forms a closed-loop feedback mechanism
   called PATSOS; an artificial neural network (ANN) based system; an
   adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Results are based on 1074
   daily carbon price observations collected to comprise a useful
   time-series dataset and for evaluation of the proposed techniques. The
   extra-sample performance of the proposed techniques is calculated.
   Analysis results are compared with those produced by other models.
   Comparison studies reveal that PATSOS is the most accurate and promising
   methodology for predicting the price of carbon. It is stated that this
   paper registers a first attempt to apply a hybrid neuro-fuzzy controller
   to forecasting carbon prices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A novel combustion diagnostics system based on flame radiation
   measurement and spectral emissions analysis is presented. The key aspect
   of this study is the proper estimation of the continuous component or
   baseline of spectral signals containing spurious discontinuities. We
   compare both, a PCA based method against an alternative method based on
   an Artificial Neural Networks model. The accuracy and computational cost
   for baseline estimation in practical industrial applications is
   analyzed, in order to incorpore the radiation measurement as a variable
   suitable for control decisions. Several experiments in industrial
   facilities demonstrate the suitability of radiation measurement via
   flame spectrum analysis, in particular the relation between the proposed
   optical variable and the process operational conditions in the case of
   an oil boiler for steam production and a ladle furnace preheating
   process. As results, the methodology based on principal components
   analysis ( PCA) provides high accuracy for baseline estimation in flame
   spectra, with metrics of RMSE approximate to 0: 1 . 10(-4) and GFC > 0:
   99 with fast computation times, smaller than typical flame flickering.

Title = {{New off-line Handwritten Signature Verification method based on
   Artificial Immune Recognition System}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},

Volume = {{51}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Natural Immune System offers many interesting features that inspired the
   design of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) used to solve various problems
   of engineering and artificial intelligence. AIS are particularly
   successful in fault detection and diagnosis applications where anomalies
   such as errors and failures are assimilated to viruses that should be
   detected. Thereby, AIS seem suitable to automatically detect forgeries
   in signature verification systems. This paper proposes a novel method
   for off-line signature verification that is based on the Artificial
   Immune Recognition System (AIRS). For feature generation, two different
   descriptors are proposed to generate signature traits. The first is the
   Gradient Local Binary Patterns that estimates gradient features based on
   the LBP neighborhood. The second descriptor is the Longest Run Feature,
   which describes the signature topology by considering longest suites of
   text pixels. Performance evaluation is carried out on CEDAR and GPDS-100
   datasets. The results obtained showed that the proposed system has
   promising performance and often comfortably outperforms the state of the
   art. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A new wavelet network based method to estimate the lightning-related
   risk of failure of power system apparatus}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{375-384}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new and fast wavelet network based method for
   estimating the risk of failure caused by lightning overvoltages in
   arrester protected networks. First, failure risks obtained by
   simulations are used as the training data for training the wavelet
   network. The trained wavelet network is then used for accurate and fast
   estimating of the lightning-related risk of failure of power system
   apparatus for all possible conditions. The accuracy of the proposed
   method has been tested and verified under various conditions in the 230
   kV network of Sistan-Baluchestan. Performance of the new method has also
   been compared with several existing methods under same conditions, and
   the test results show better accuracy of the proposed method. The
   proposed method not only does not have the restriction of conventional
   methods, but also it does not have the limitations associated with
   traditional neural networks based algorithms such as convergence to
   local optimum points, over-fit and/or under-fit problems. The main
   contribution of the paper is an accurate (due to proper selection of the
   training data set based on the k-fold cross validation technique and
   using wavelet network for estimation), fast (mean calculation time for
   the network risk of failure computation is 54 s) and simple wavelet
   network-based algorithm (as compared to the conventional algorithms) for
   estimating the lightning-related risk of failure of power system

Title = {{Lexicographic bottleneck mixed-model assembly line balancing problem:
   Artificial bee colony and tabu search approaches with optimised
   parameters}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{151-166}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The lexicographic bottleneck assembly line balancing problem is a
   recently introduced problem which aims at obtaining a smooth workload
   distribution among workstations. This is achieved hierarchically. The
   workload of the most heavily loaded workstation is minimised, followed
   by the workload of the second most heavily loaded workstation and so on.
   This study contributes to knowledge by examining the application of the
   lexicographic bottleneck objective on mixed-model lines, where more than
   one product model is produced in an inter-mixed sequence. The main
   characteristics of the lexicographic bottleneck mixed-model assembly
   line balancing problem are described with numerical examples. Another
   contribution of the study is the methodology used to deal with the
   complex structure of the problem. Two effective meta-heuristic
   approaches, namely artificial bee colony and tabu search, are proposed.
   The parameters of the proposed meta-heuristics are optimised using
   response surface methodology, which is a well-known design of
   experiments technique, as a unique contribution to the expert and
   intelligent systems literature. Different from the common tendency in
   the literature (which aims to optimise one parameter at a time), all
   parameters are optimised simultaneously. Therefore, it is shown how a
   complex production planning problem can be solved using sophisticated
   artificial intelligence techniques with optimised parameters. The
   methodology used for parameter setting can be applied to other
   metaheuristics for solving complex problems in practice. The
   performances of both algorithms are assessed using well-known test
   problems and it is observed that both algorithms find promising
   solutions. Artificial bee colony algorithm outperforms tabu search in
   minimising the number of workstations while tabu search shows a better
   performance in minimising the value of lexicographic bottleneck
   objective function. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There are plenty of intelligent machines in our world today: digital
   computers and autonomous robots. At the heart of each of these machines
   there are automatic formal systems (programs running on a digital
   computer). Now, if the interpretation of a formal system does not belong
   to the formal system itself, if the interpretation has to be added, it
   is worth asking: in the case of these intelligent machines that are
   massively interspersed in our social interactions, where does the
   interpretation come from? In this paper, we analyse what we call the
   invisibility of interpretation. Dealing with various types of formal
   systems (computers, robots, formalist approaches to Economics), the
   human source of the interpretation of these systems is sometimes
   concealed by a formalist restriction. To show how the formalist
   restriction produces the invisibility of interpretation allows us to
   underline our responsibility, as human agents, for all this
   interpretative work-and its importance for us as human beings.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Systems evolve in order to adjust and survive. The paper's contribution
   is that this evolvement is inadequate without an evolutionary telos. It
   is argued that without the presence of self-destruction in multiple
   levels of our existence and surroundings, our survival would have been
   impossible. This paper recognises an appreciation of auto-catastrophe at
   the cell level, in human attitudes (both as an individual and in
   societies), and extended to Earth and out to galaxies. Auto-Catastrophic
   Theory combines evolution with auto-catastrophic behaviours and
   innovative machinery by offering new themes of understanding their
   merging such as (a) protogenic and deuterogenic autocatastrophic
   processes, (b) protogenic and deuterogenic survival processes, and (c)
   `alive', partially `alive', and non-'alive' systems. The value of
   self-destruction relies on a numerical stability within a system and
   correlational relationships between systems. Auto-Catastrophic Theory
   provides novel justifications why artificial intelligence: (a) is
   crucial to overcome the extinction of humanity (via H+), (b) is crucial
   to offer indirect survival of humanity (by saving its history), and (c)
   is at the same time a threat for humanity. These novel justifications
   and themes, developed by combining evolution with catastrophe as well as
   innovative machinery, expand our knowledge of how best to handle fresh
   challenges ahead.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple model of an AI (artificial intelligence)
   arms race, where several development teams race to build the first AI.
   Under the assumption that the first AI will be very powerful and

   safety precautions if need be. This paper presents the Nash equilibrium
   of this process, where each team takes the correct amount of safety
   precautions in the arms race. Having extra development teams and extra
   enmity between teams can increase the danger of an AI disaster,
   especially if risk-taking is more important than skill in developing the
   AI. Surprisingly, information also increases the risks: the more teams
   know about each others' capabilities (and about their own), the more the
   danger increases. Should these results persist in more realistic models
   and analysis, it points the way to methods of increasing the chance of
   the safe development of AI.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive study of intelligent tools used to classify broken rotor
   bars in induction motors, which operate with three different types of
   frequency inverters, is presented. The diagnosis of defective rotor bars
   is a critical issue for the predictive maintenance of induction motors.
   A proper classification of these defects in their early stages of
   evolution is necessary for preventing major machine failures and
   production downtime. The proposed approach is performed by analysing the
   amplitude of the stator current signal in the time domain, using a
   dynamic acquisition rate based on machine frequency supply. To assess
   classification accuracy under the various severity levels of the faults,
   the performance of four different learning machine techniques is
   investigated: (i) fuzzy ARTMAP network; (ii) support vector machine
   (sequential minimal optimisation); (iii) k-nearest neighbour; and (iv)
   multilayer perceptron network. Results obtained from 1274 experimental
   tests are presented in order to validate the study, which considers a
   wide range of load conditions and operating frequencies. Experimental
   results presented in this study validate the robustness and efficacy of
   the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The medical image processing process is one of the most important areas
   of research in medical applications in digitized medical information. A
   medical images have a large sizes. Since the coming of digital medical
   information, the important challenge is to care for the conduction and
   requirements of huge data, including medical images. Compression is
   considered as one of the necessary algorithm to explain this problem. A
   large amount of medical images must be compressed using lossless
   compression. This paper proposes a new medical image compression
   algorithm founded on lifting wavelet transform CDF 9/7 joined with SPIHT
   coding algorithm, this algorithm applied the lifting composition to
   confirm the benefit of the wavelet transform. To develop the proposed
   algorithm, the outcomes compared with other compression algorithm like
   JPEG codec. Experimental results proves that the anticipated algorithm
   is superior to another algorithm in both lossy and lossless compression
   for all medical images tested. The Wavelet-SPIHT algorithm provides PSNR
   very important values for MRI images.}},

Abstract = {{Boosting is a well known and efficient technique for constructing a
   classifier ensemble. An ensemble is built incrementally by altering the
   distribution of training data set and forcing learners to focus on
   misclassification errors. In this paper, an improvement to Boosting
   algorithm called DivBoosting algorithm is proposed and studied.
   Experiments on several data sets are conducted on both Boosting and
   DivBoosting. The experimental results show that DivBoosting is a
   promising method for ensemble pruning. We believe that it has many
   advantages over traditional boosting method because its mechanism is not
   solely based on selecting the most accurate base classifiers but also
   based on selecting the most diverse set of classifiers.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{3-17}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a color-based technique for object segmentation in
   colored digital images. Principally, we make use of some color spaces to
   segment pixels as either objects of interest or non-objects using
   artificial neural networks (ANN). This study clearly shows how a novel
   method for fusion of the existing color spaces produces better results
   in practice than individual color spaces. The segmented objects include
   lips, faces, hands, fingers and tree leaves. Using several databases to
   represent these problems, the ANN was trained on the color of the pixel
   and its surrounding 8 neighbors to be an object or non-object; in the
   test mode the trained set was used to segment the 9 pixels in the test
   image into object or non-object. The feature vector was used for
   training and testing results from the fusion of different types of color
   information that came from different color models of the targeted pixel.
   Several experiments were conducted on different databases and objects to
   evaluate the proposed method; significant results were recorded, showing
   the power of expressiveness of color and some texture information to
   deal with the object segmentation problem. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The usage of decision support tools in emergency departments, based on

   A database of 255.668 triaged nonobstetric emergency department
   presentations from the Ramon y Cajal University Hospital of Madrid, from
   January 2011 to December 2012, was used to develop and test the models,
   with 66\% of the data used for derivation and 34\% for validation, with
   an ordered nonrandom partition. On the validation dataset areas under
   the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.8568 (95\% confidence
   interval, 0.8508-0.8583) for the logistic regression model and 0.8575
   (95\% confidence interval, 0.8540-0. 8610) for the artificial neural
   network model. chi(2) Values for Hosmer-Lemeshow fixed ``deciles of
   risk{''} were 65.32 for the logistic regression model and 17.28 for the
   artificial neural network model. A nomogram was generated upon the

Abstract = {{Learning is a general concept, playing an important role in many
   Artificial intelligence domains. In this paper, we address the learning
   paradigm used to explain failures or conflicts encountered during
   search. This explanation, derived by conflict analysis, and generally
   expressed as a new constraint, is usually used to dynamically avoid
   future occurrences of similar situations. Before focusing on clause
   learning in Boolean satisfiability (SAT), we first overview some
   important works on this powerful reasoning tool in other domains such as
   constraint satisfaction and truth maintenance systems. Then, we present
   a comprehensive survey of the most important works having led to what is
   called today-conflict driven clause learning-which is one of the key
   components of modern SAT solvers. We also overview some of the original
   extensions or variants of clauses learning. In theory, current SAT
   solvers with clause learning are as powerful as general resolution proof
   systems. In practice, real-world SAT instances with millions of
   variables and clauses are now in the scope of this solving paradigm.}},

Title = {{An Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Method Using Unsupervised Feature
   Learning Towards Mechanical Big Data}},

Abstract = {{Intelligent fault diagnosis is a promising tool to deal with mechanical
   big data due to its ability in rapidly and efficiently processing
   collected signals and providing accurate diagnosis results. In
   traditional intelligent diagnosis methods, however, the features are
   manually extracted depending on prior knowledge and diagnostic
   expertise. Such processes take advantage of human ingenuity but are
   time-consuming and labor-intensive. Inspired by the idea of unsupervised
   feature learning that uses artificial intelligence techniques to learn
   features from raw data, a two-stage learning method is proposed for
   intelligent diagnosis of machines. In the first learning stage of the
   method, sparse filtering, an unsupervised two-layer neural network, is
   used to directly learn features from mechanical vibration signals. In
   the second stage, softmax regression is employed to classify the health
   conditions based on the learned features. The proposed method is
   validated by a motor bearing dataset and a locomotive bearing dataset,
   respectively. The results show that the proposed method obtains fairly
   high diagnosis accuracies and is superior to the existing methods for
   the motor bearing dataset. Because of learning features adaptively, the
   proposed method reduces the need of human labor and makes intelligent
   fault diagnosis handle big data more easily.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this research is to develop a classifier using an
   artificial immune system (AIS) combined with population-based
   incremental learning (PBIL) and collaborative filtering (CF) for network
   intrusion detection. AIS is a powerful tool in terms of extirpating
   antigens inspired by the principles and processes of the natural immune
   system. PBIL uses past experiences to evolve into new species through
   learning and adopting the idea of CF for classification. The novelty of
   this research is in its combining of the three above mentioned
   approaches to develop a new classifier which can be applied to detect
   network intrusion, with incremental learning capability, by adapting the
   weight of key features. In addition, four mechanisms: creating a new
   antibody using PBIL, dynamic adjustment of feature weighting using
   clonal expansion, antibody hierarchy adjustment using mean affinity, as
   well as usage rates, are proposed to intensify AIS performance. As shown
   by the comparison carried out with other artificial intelligence and
   evolutionary computation approaches in network anomaly detection
   problems, our PBIL-AIS(CF) classifier can achieve high accuracy for the
   benchmark problem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ageing power systems infrastructure and concerns about climate change

   use of machine learning algorithms to distinguish between different
   types of partial discharges, which are closely correlated with
   insulation failure. Measurements made using acoustic emission sensors
   are used to train and test different classification algorithms. In an
   earlier study, high classification accuracies were achieved using
   training and test datasets collected under similar measurement
   conditions. However, under different conditions, classification accuracy
   was greatly reduced. Experiments using the latest classification
   techniques were performed, producing significant improvements in

Abstract = {{The interplay of machine learning (ML) and optimization methods is an

   Parameter selection for classification models is an important task for

   which is the most well-known model selection method can be very time
   consuming for large data sets. One of the recent model selection
   techniques developed for support vector machines (SVMs) is based on the
   observed test point margins. In this study, observed margin strategy is
   integrated into our novel infinite kernel learning (IKL) algorithm
   together with multi-local procedure (MLP) which is an optimization
   technique to find global solution. The experimental results show
   improvements in accuracy and speed when comparing with multiple kernel

Abstract = {{What are the most relevant factors to be considered by employees when
   searching for an employer? The answer to this question poses valuable
   knowledge from the Business Intelligence viewpoint since it allows
   companies to retain personnel and attract competent employees. It leads
   to an increase in sales of their products or services, therefore
   remaining competitive across similar companies in the market. In this
   paper we assess the attractiveness of companies in Belgium by using a
   new two-stage methodology based on Artificial Intelligence techniques.
   The proposed method allows constructing high-quality prototypes from
   partial rankings indicating experts' preferences. Being more explicit,
   in the first step we propose a fuzzy clustering algorithm for partial
   rankings called fuzzy c-aggregation. This algorithm is based on the
   well-known fuzzy c-means procedure and uses the Hausdorff distance as
   dissimilarity functional and a counting strategy for updating the center
   of each cluster. However, we cannot ensure the optimality of such
   prototypes, and therefore more accurate prototypes must be derived. That
   is why the second step is focused on solving the extended Kemeny ranking
   problem for each discovered cluster taking into account the estimated
   membership matrix. To accomplish that, we adopt an optimization method
   based on Swarm Intelligence that exploits a colony of artificial ants.
   Several simulations show the effectiveness of the proposal for the
   real-world problem under investigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{A hybrid ANFIS model based on empirical mode decomposition for stock
   time series forecasting}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},

Abstract = {{Time series forecasting is an important and widely popular topic in the
   research of system modeling, and stock index forecasting is an important
   issue in time series forecasting. Accurate stock price forecasting is a
   challenging task in predicting financial time series. Time series
   methods have been applied successfully to forecasting models in many
   domains, including the stock market. Unfortunately, there are 3 major
   drawbacks of using time series methods for the stock market: (1) some
   models can not be applied to datasets that do not follow statistical
   assumptions; (2) most time series models that use stock data with a
   significant amount of noise involutedly (caused by changes in market
   conditions and environments) have worse forecasting performance; and (3)
   the rules that are mined from artificial neural networks (ANNs) are not
   easily understandable.
   To address these problems and improve the forecasting performance of
   time series models, this paper proposes a hybrid time series adaptive
   network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model that is centered
   around empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to forecast stock prices in
   the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX)
   and Hang Seng Stock Index (HSI). To measure its forecasting performance,
   the proposed model is compared with Chen's model, Yu's model, the
   autoregressive (AR) model, the ANFIS model, and the support vector
   regression (SVR) model. The results show that our model is superior to
   the other models, based on root mean squared error (RMSE) values. (C)

Abstract = {{Aerial image categorization plays an indispensable role in remote
   sensing and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a new
   aerial image categorization framework, focusing on organizing the local
   patches of each aerial image into multiple discriminative subgraphs.
   These meaningful subgraphs reflect both the geometric property and the
   color distribution of an aerial image. First, each aerial image is
   decomposed into a collection of regions in terms of their color
   intensities. Thereby region connected graph (RCG), which models the
   connection between the spatial neighboring regions, is constructed to
   encode the spatial context of an aerial image. Second, a novel subgraph
   mining technique is adopted to discover the frequent structures in the
   RCGs constructed from the training aerial images. Thereafter, a set of
   refined structures is selected among the frequent ones toward being
   highly discriminative and low redundant. Lastly, given a new aerial
   image, its sub-RCGs corresponding to the refined structures are
   extracted. They are further quantized into a discriminative vector for
   SVM classification. Thorough experimental results validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the visualized mined
   subgraphs show that the discriminative topologies of each aerial image
   are discovered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{54-64}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of an intelligent temperature to
   frequency converter to measure the temperature using a negative
   temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor. The signal conditioning
   circuit (SCC) of the NTC thermistor is a modified timer circuit whose
   control voltage is generated by a difference amplifier. The thermistor
   SCC acts as a temperature to frequency converter and exhibits a moderate
   linear temperature-frequency characteristic over a range of 0-100
   degrees C with a linearity error of +/- 3.5\%. A multilayer perceptron
   (MLP) neural network with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is used for
   modeling and nonlinearity estimation of the converter. The LM algorithm
   effectively reduces the linearity error as compared to the
   Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) and the scaled conjugate
   gradient (SCG) algorithms. Mean square error (MSE), regression
   coefficients, linearity, accuracy and dispersion spread are used to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed ANN-based modeling. The
   intelligence of the ANN-based modeling is embedded in a low cost
   microcontroller unit and the performance is experimentally verified on a
   prototype unit. The linearity error and sensitivity of the proposed unit
   are approximately +/- 0.35\% and 5 kHz/degrees C respectively. (c) 2016

Abstract = {{The Critical Clearing Time (CCT) is a key issue for Transient Stability
   Assessment (TSA) in electrical power system operation, security, and
   maintenance. However, there are some difficulties in obtaining the CCT,
   which include the accuracy, fast computation, and robustness for TSA
   online. Therefore, obtaining the CCT is still an interesting topic for
   investigation. This paper proposes a new technique for obtaining CCT
   based on numerical calculations and artificial intelligence techniques.
   First, the CCT is calculated by the critical trajectory method based on
   critical generation. Second, the CCT is learned by Extreme Learning
   Machine (ELM). This proposed method has the ability to obtain the CCT
   with load changes, different fault occurrences, accuracy, and fast
   computation, and considering the controller. This proposed method is
   tested by the IEEE 3-machine 9-bus system and Java-Bali 500 kV
   54-machine 25-bus system. The proposed method can provide accurate CCTs
   with an average error of 0.33\% for the Neural Network (NN) method and
   an average error of 0.06\% for the ELM method. The simulation result
   also shows that this method is a robust algorithm that can address
   several load changes and different locations of faults occurring. There
   are 29 load changes used to obtain the CCT, with 20 load changes
   included for the training process and 9 load changes not included. (C)

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Pharmaceutical industry is tightly regulated owing to health
   concerns. Over the years, the use of computational intelligence (CI)
   tools has increased in pharmaceutical research and development,
   manufacturing, and quality control. Quality characteristics of tablets
   like tensile strength are important indicators of expected tablet
   performance. Predictive, yet transparent, CI models which can be
   analysed for insights into the formulation and development process.
   Methods: This work uses data from a galenical tableting study and
   computational intelligence methods like decision trees, random forests,
   fuzzy systems, artificial neural networks, and symbolic regression to
   establish models for the outcome of tensile strength. Data was divided
   in training and test fold according to ten fold cross validation scheme
   and RMSE was used as an evaluation metric. Tree based ensembles and
   symbolic regression methods are presented as transparent models with
   extracted rules and mathematical formula, respectively, explaining the
   CI models in greater detail.
   Results: CI models for tensile strength of tablets based on the
   formulation design and process parameters have been established. Best
   models exhibit normalized RMSE of 7 \%. Rules from fuzzy systems and
   random forests are shown to increase transparency of CI models. A
   mathematical formula generated by symbolic regression is presented as a
   transparent model.
   Conclusions: CI models explain the variation of tensile strength
   according to formulation and manufacturing process characteristics. CI
   models can be further analyzed to extract actionable knowledge making
   the artificial learning process more transparent and acceptable for use
   in pharmaceutical quality and safety domains.}},

Abstract = {{The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a relatively new swarm
   intelligence-based optimization algorithm. Its simplicity of
   implementation, relatively few parameter settings and promising
   optimization capability make it widely used in different fields.
   However, it has problems of slow convergence due to its solution search
   equation. Here, a new solution search equation based on a combination of
   the elite solution pool and the block perturbation scheme is proposed to
   improve the performance of the algorithm. In addition, two different
   solution search equations are used by employed bees and onlooker bees to
   balance the exploration and exploitation of the algorithm. The developed
   algorithm is validated by a set of well-known numerical benchmark
   functions. It is then applied to optimize two ship hull forms with
   minimum resistance. The tested results show that the proposed new
   improved ABC algorithm can outperform the ABC algorithm in most of the
   tested problems.}},

Abstract = {{Finding the best solution for an optimization problem is a tedious task,
   specifically in the presence of enormously represented features. When we
   handle a problem such as job recommendations that have a diversity of
   their features, we should rely to metaheuristics. For example, the
   Artificial Immune System which is a novel computational intelligence
   paradigm achieving diversification and exploration of the search space
   as well as exploitation of the good solutions were reached in reasonable
   time. Unfortunately, in problems with diversity nature such job
   recommendation, it produces a huge number of antibodies that causes a
   large number of matching processes affect the system efficiency. To
   leverage this issue, we present a new intelligence algorithm inspired by
   immunology based on monoclonal antibodies production principle that, up
   to our knowledge, has never applied in science and engineering problems.
   The proposed algorithm recommends ranked list of best applicants for a
   certain job. We discussed the design issues, as well as the immune
   system processes that should be applied to the problem. Finally, the
   experiments are conducted that shown an excellence of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Question Answering (QA) task is still an active area of research in
   information retrieval. A variety of methods which have been proposed in
   the literature during the last few decades to solve this task have
   achieved mixed success. However, such methods developed in the Arabic
   language are scarce and do not have a good performance record. This is
   due to the challenges of Arabic language. QA based on Frequently Asked
   Questions is an important branch of QA in which a question is answered
   based on pre-answered ones. In this paper, the aim is to build a
   question answering system that responds to a user inquiry based on
   pre-answered questions. The proposed approach is based on Latent
   Dirichlet Allocation. Firstly, the dataset, pairs of questions and
   associated answers, will be grouped into several clusters of related
   documents. Next, when a new question to be answered is posed to the
   system, it, therefore, starts to assign this question to its appropriate
   cluster, then, use a similarity measure to get the top ten closest
   possible answers. Preliminary results show that the proposed method is
   achieving a good level of performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a dynamic modeling approach that enables to design
   complex high level conceptual representations of models in the form of
   causal-temporal networks, which can be automatically transformed into
   executable numerical model representations. Dedicated software is
   available to support designing models in a graphical manner, and
   automatically transforming them into an executable format and performing
   simulation experiments. The temporal causal network modeling format used
   makes it easy to take into account theories and findings about complex
   brain processes known from Cognitive, Affective and Social Neuroscience,
   which, for example, often involve dynamics based on interrelating
   cycles. This enables to address complex phenomena such as the
   integration of emotions within all kinds of cognitive processes, and of
   internal simulation and mirroring of mental processes of others. In this
   paper also the applicability has been discussed in general terms. (C)

   cognitive architecture}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{169-178}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a historical perspective on the origin of the
   enactive approach to cognitive science, starting chronologically from
   cybernetics, with the aim of clarifying its main concepts, such as
   enaction, autopoiesis, structural coupling and natural drift; thus
   showing their influences in computational approaches and models of
   cognitive architecture. Works of renowned authors, as well as some of
   their main commentators, were addressed to report the development of
   enactive approach. We indicate that the enactive approach transcends its
   original context within biology, and at a second moment within
   connectionism, changes the understanding of the relationships so far
   established between the body and the environment, and the ideas of
   conceptual relationships between the mind and the body. The influence on
   computational theories is of great importance, leading to new artificial
   intelligence systems as well as the proposition of complex, autopoietic
   and alive machines. Finally, the article stresses the importance of the
   enactive approach in the design of agents, understanding that previous
   approaches have very different cognitive architectures and that a
   prototypical model of enactive cognitive architecture is one of the
   largest challenges today. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Photo aesthetic quality evaluation is a challenging task in artificial
   intelligence systems. In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired
   aesthetic descriptor that mimicks humans sequentially perceiving
   visually/semantically salient(1)regions in a photo. In particular, a
   weakly supervised learning paradigm is developed to project the local
   image descriptors into a low-dimensional semantic space. Then, each
   graphlet can be described by multiple types of visual features, both in
   low-level and in high-level. Since humans usually perceive only a few
   salient regions in a photo, a sparsity-constrained graphlet ranking
   algorithm is proposed that seamlessly integrates both the low-level and
   the high-level visual cues. Top-ranked graphlets are those
   visually/semantically prominent local aesthetic descriptors in a photo.
   They are sequentially linked into a path that simulates humans actively
   viewing process. Finally, we learn a probabilistic aesthetic measure
   based on such actively viewing paths (AVPs) from the training photos.
   Experimental results show that: 1) the AVPs are 87.65\% consistent with
   real human gaze shifting paths, as verified by the eye-tracking data and
   2) our aesthetic measure outperforms many of its competitors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns the an intelligent mobile application for spatial

   research: The first one is the usage of mobile robots for 3D mapping of

   aspect is related with a novel Software as a Service system that allows
   access to robotic functionalities and data over the Ethernet, thus we
   demonstrate the use of the novel NVIDIA GRID technology allowing to
   virtualize the graphic processing unit. We introduce Complex Shape
   Histogram, a core component of our artificial intelligence engine, used
   for classifying 3D point clouds with a Support Vector Machine. We use
   Complex Shape Histograms also for loop closing detection in the
   simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm. Our intelligent mobile
   system is built on top of the Qualitative Spatio-Temporal Representation
   and Reasoning framework. This framework defines an ontology and a
   semantic model, which are used for building the intelligent mobile user
   interfaces. We show experiments demonstrating advantages of our
   approach. In addition, we test our prototypes in the field after the

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{250-267}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Optimal rail network infrastructure and rolling stock utilization can be
   achieved with use of different scheduling tools by extensive planning a
   long time before actual operations. The initial train timetable takes
   into account possible smaller disturbances, which can be compensated
   within the schedule. Bigger disruptions, such as accidents, rolling
   stock breakdown, prolonged passenger boarding, and changed speed limit
   cause delays that require train rescheduling. In this paper, we
   introduce a train rescheduling method based on reinforcement learning,
   and more specifically, Q-learning. We present here the Q-learning
   principles for train rescheduling, which consist of a learning agent and
   its actions, environment and its states, as well as rewards. The use of
   the proposed approach is first illustrated on a simple rescheduling
   problem comprising a single-lane track with three trains. The evaluation
   of the approach is performed on extensive set of experiments carried out
   on a real-world railway network in Slovenia. The empirical results show
   that Q-learning lead to rescheduling solutions that are at least
   equivalent and often superior to those of several basic rescheduling
   methods that do not rely on learning agents. The solutions are learned
   Within reasonable computational time, a crucial factor for real-time
   applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Particle accelerators are host to myriad nonlinear and complex physical
   phenomena. They often involve a multitude of interacting systems, are
   subject to tight performance demands, and should be able to run for
   extended periods of time with minimal interruptions. Often times,
   traditional control techniques cannot fully meet these requirements. One
   promising avenue is to introduce machine learning and sophisticated
   control techniques inspired by artificial intelligence, particularly in
   light of recent theoretical and practical advances in these fields.
   Within machine learning and artificial intelligence, neural networks are
   particularly well-suited to modeling, control, and diagnostic analysis
   of complex, nonlinear, and time-varying systems, as well as systems with
   large parameter spaces. Consequently, the use of neural network-based
   modeling and control techniques could be of significant benefit to
   particle accelerators. For the same reasons, particle accelerators are
   also ideal test-beds for these techniques. Many early attempts to apply
   neural networks to particle accelerators yielded mixed results due to
   the relative immaturity of the technology for such tasks. The purpose of
   this paper is to re-introduce neural networks to the particle
   accelerator community and report on some work in neural network control
   that is being conducted as part of a dedicated collaboration between
   Fermilab and Colorado State University (CSU). We describe some of the
   challenges of particle accelerator control, highlight recent advances in
   neural network techniques, discuss some promising avenues for
   incorporating neural networks into particle accelerator control systems,
   and describe a neural network-based control system that is being
   developed for resonance control of an RF electron gun at the Fermilab
   Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility, including initial
   experimental results from a benchmark controller.}},

Title = {{Bearing capacity of thin-walled shallow foundations: an experimental and
   artificial intelligence-based study}},

Abstract = {{Thin-walled spread foundations are used in coastal projects where the
   soil strength is relatively low. Developing a predictive model of
   bearing capacity for this kind of foundation is of interest due to the
   fact that the famous bearing capacity equations are proposed for
   conventional footings. Many studies underlined the applicability of
   artificial neural networks (ANNs) in predicting the bearing capacity of
   foundations. However, the majority of these models are built using
   conventional ANNs, which suffer from slow rate of learning as well as
   getting trapped in local minima. Moreover, they are mainly developed for
   conventional footings. The prime objective of this study is to propose
   an improved ANN-based predictive model of bearing capacity for
   thin-walled shallow foundations. In this regard, a relatively large
   dataset comprising 145 recorded cases of related footing load tests was
   compiled from the literature. The dataset includes bearing capacity
   (Q(u)), friction angle, unit weight of sand, footing width, and
   thin-wall length to footing width ratio (L-w/B). Apart from Q(u), other
   parameters were set as model inputs. To enhance the diversity of the
   data, four more related laboratory footing load tests were conducted on
   the Johor Bahru sand, and results were added to the dataset.
   Experimental findings suggest an almost 0.5 times increase in the
   bearing capacity in loose and dense sands when L-w/B is increased from
   0.5 to 1.12. Overall, findings show the feasibility of the ANN-based
   predictive model improved with particle swarm optimization (PSO). The
   correlation coefficient was 0.98 for testing data, suggesting that the
   model serves as a reliable tool in predicting the bearing capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating heterogeneous wireless sensor networks with the Sensor Web
   will increase the utilisation of sensors and facilitate the sharing of
   their observations in environmental monitoring. A centralised framework
   was introduced for the semantic integration of heterogeneous sensors and
   their observations into open geospatial consortium sensor observation
   services (SOSs). An ontology called 1451 ontology was created following
   IEEE 1451 standards. The 1451 ontology not only describes the sensor
   properties and observations, but it also specifies the communication
   interface and protocol. Another ontology called SOS data ontology was
   also created to represent the feature of interest of the SOS. A matching
   rule was established to map the two created ontologies with the aim of
   creating a uniform collaboration of sensors scattered worldwide through
   the Sensor web. A case study of soil temperature sensor and
   three-dimensional digital compass shows that sensors can actively
   register themselves and insert observations into the SOS through the
   developed programme embedded in terminal devices and the ontology
   matching module of the web. A semantic link between the IEEE 1451
   specifications and the SOS operations will enable the spatially
   distributed sensors to publish their information in a unified way and to
   work cooperatively in real-time for significant environmental
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Buffer overflow (BOF) vulnerabilities when present in code can be
   exploited to violate security objectives such as availability,
   confidentiality and integrity. They make up substantial portion of input
   manipulation attacks due to their common presence and ease of
   exploitation. In this study, the authors propose a hybrid approach
   combining static and dynamic program analysis with machine learning to
   audit BOFs. Simple rules to generate test data is proposed to confirm
   some of the vulnerabilities through dynamic analysis. Confirmed cases
   can be fixed by developers without further verification. Statements
   whose vulnerability is not confirmed by dynamic analysis are predicted
   by mining static code attributes. In the authors' evaluation using
   standard benchmarks, their best classifier achieved a recall over 93\%
   and accuracy >94\%. Dynamic analysis itself confirmed 34\% of known
   vulnerabilities along with reporting six new bugs, thereby reducing by
   third, otherwise needed manual auditing effort.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to propose a hierarchical topic evolution
   model (HTEM) that can organize time-varying topics in a hierarchy and
   discover their evolutions with multiple timescales. In the proposed
   HTEM, topics near the root of the hierarchy are more abstract and also
   evolve in the longer timescales than those near the leaves. To achieve
   this goal, the distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP) is
   extended to a new nested process that is able to simultaneously model
   the dependencies among data and the relationship between clusters. The
   HTEM is proposed based on the new process for time-stamped documents, in
   which the timestamp is utilized to measure the dependencies among
   documents. Moreover, an efficient Gibbs sampler is developed for the
   proposed HTEM. Our experimental results on two popular real-world data
   sets verify that the proposed HTEM can capture coherent topics and
   discover their hierarchical evolutions. It also outperforms the baseline
   model in terms of likelihood on held-out data.}},

Abstract = {{The Sierpinski gasket fractal antenna is most popular structure in the
   domain of fractal antennas. This fractal antenna has multi-band
   performance, and hence, the design of this antenna for the desired
   frequencies is a challenging problem. The artificial intelligence tools
   like artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic systems, bio-inspired
   optimization techniques are appropriate to provide accurate design
   solution in such cases. In this paper, three most popular bio-inspired
   optimization algorithms: genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization
   (PSO), and bacterial foraging optimization, have been proposed to solve
   the design issues of Sierpinski gasket pre-fractal antenna. Their
   performances are analyzed and are compared with the experimental
   results. A simplified expression for calculation of resonant frequency
   of Sierpinski gasket pre-fractal antenna is proposed and is used as the
   objective function. Finally, the effectiveness is compared on the basis
   of three different measures: mean absolute percentage error, the average
   time taken by the models to evaluate the results, and the coefficient of
   correlation. The results indicate that the PSO algorithm is most
   suitable for this type of antenna.}},

Abstract = {{Supplier evaluation plays a critical role in a successful supply chain
   management. Hence, the evaluation and selection of the right suppliers
   have become a central decision of manufacturing business activities
   around the world. Consequently, numerous individual and integrated
   methods have been presented to evaluate and select suppliers. The
   current literature shows that hybrid artificial intelligence (AI)-based
   models have received much attention for supplier evaluation. Integrated
   data envelopment analysis-artificial neural network (DEA-ANN) is one of
   the combined methods that have recently garnered great attention from
   academics and practitioners. However, DEA-ANN model has some drawbacks,
   which make some limitation in the evaluation process. In this study, we
   aim at improving the previous DEA-AI models by integrating the Kourosh
   and Arash method as a robust model of DEA with a new AI approach namely
   genetic programming (GP) to overcome the shortcomings of previous DEA-AI
   models in supplier selection. Indeed, in this paper, GP provides a
   robust nonlinear mathematical equation for the suppliers' efficiency
   using the determined criteria. To validate the model, adaptive
   neuro-fuzzy inference system as a powerful tool was used to compare the
   result with GP-based model. In addition, parametric analysis and unseen
   data set were used to validate the precision of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Radio-frequency welding is a material joining process based on the
   dielectric loss principle, which is well suited to join plastic
   materials used in biomedical applications such as drainage and solution
   bags. For these kind of applications, it is very important that welds
   are of good quality due to the sterility and biological hazard concerns.
   This usually means that welds must have a certain predetermined
   strength. In production environment, destructive testing of sample
   products is a commonly used method of quality control. This is, however,
   time consuming and the results obtained on sample testing can by no
   means be fully relied upon for all the products within a batch.
   Therefore, a decision was made to design an artificial intelligence
   monitoring system that could determine the quality of each weld based on
   the measurements performed in real time. The main signal being measured
   is the displacement of the upper electrode. Various parameters of the
   displacement curve were found out to be in relation with the weld
   strength. Due to disturbances in air supply that result in variable
   welding force, a force sensor was added as well. The measurements
   obtained from both the sensors were used to form the input vector for
   linear vector quantization neural network. This type of network is
   suitable to put the input vectors in different classes. In our case,
   this means if a certain measurement corresponds to a good quality weld
   or a bad quality weld. The experiments have shown that the proposed
   neural network performs really well and could be of great value in a
   production environment.}},

   approach is an extension of the observer-based method with artificial

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},

Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{157-168}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In the bioinformatics community, it is really important to find an
   accurate and simultaneous alignment among diverse biological sequences
   which are assumed to have an evolutionary relationship. From the
   alignment, the sequences homology is inferred and the shared
   evolutionary origins among the sequences are extracted by using
   phylogenetic analysis. This problem is known as the multiple sequence
   alignment (MSA) problem. In the literature, several approaches have been
   proposed to solve the MSA problem, such as progressive alignments
   methods, consistency-based algorithms, or genetic algorithms (GAs). In
   this work, we propose a Hybrid Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm
   based on the behaviour of honey bees for solving the MSA problem, the
   hybrid multiobjective artificial bee colony (HMOABC) algorithm. HMOABC
   considers two objective functions with the aim of preserving the quality
   and consistency of the alignment: the weighted sum-of-pairs function
   with affine gap penalties (WSP) and the number of totally conserved (TC)
   columns score. In order to assess the accuracy of HMOABC, we have used
   the BA1iBASE benchmark (version 3.0), which according to the developers
   presents more challenging test cases representing the real problems
   encountered when aligning large sets of complex sequences. Our
   multiobjective approach has been compared with 13 well-known methods in
   bioinformatics field and with other 6 evolutionary algorithms published
   in the literature. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) is a new type of swarm

   guide the further foraging of the artificial bees. Essentially, ABCM is
   inspired by the biological study of natural honeybees, rather than most
   of the other ABC variants that integrate existing algorithms into ABC

Abstract = {{Female breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world.
   Several efforts in artificial intelligence have been made to help
   improving the diagnostic accuracy at earlier stages. However, the
   identification of breast abnormalities, like masses, on mammographic
   images is not a trivial task, especially for dense breasts.
   In this paper we describe our novel mass detection process that includes
   three successive steps of enhancement, characterization and
   classification. The proposed enhancement system is based mainly on the
   analysis of the breast texture. First of all, a filtering step with
   morphological operators and soft thresholding is achieved. Then, we
   remove from the filtered breast region, all the details that may
   interfere with the eventual masses, including pectoral muscle and
   galactophorous tree. The pixels belonging to this tree will be
   interpolated and replaced by the average of the neighborhood. In the
   characterization process, measurement of the Gaussian density in the
   wavelet domain allows the segmentation of the masses. Finally, a
   comparative classification mechanism based on the Bayesian
   regularization back-propagation networks and ANFIS techniques is
   proposed. The tests were conducted on the MIAS database. The results
   showed the robustness of the proposed enhancement method. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Background and objective: In this paper, we have tested the suitability
   of using different artificial intelligence-based algorithms for decision
   support when classifying the risk of congenital heart surgery. In this
   sense, classification of those surgical risks provides enormous benefits
   as the a priori estimation of surgical outcomes depending on either the
   type of disease or the type of repair, and other elements that influence
   the final result. This preventive estimation may help to avoid future
   complications, or even death.
   Methods: We have evaluated four machine learning algorithms to achieve
   our objective: multilayer perceptron, self-organizing map, radial basis
   function networks and decision trees. The architectures implemented have
   the aim of classifying among three types of surgical risk: low
   complexity, medium complexity and high complexity.
   Results: Accuracy outcomes achieved range between 80\% and 99\%, being
   the multilayer perceptron method the one that offered a higher hit
   ratio.
   Conclusions: According to the results, it is feasible to develop a
   clinical decision support system using the evaluated algorithms. Such
   system would help cardiology specialists, paediatricians and surgeons to
   forecast the level of risk related to a congenital heart disease
   surgery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive, in-depth study of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) seems
   to be of crucial importance in the research of cardiovascular disease
   (CVD) in order to prevent (or reduce) the chance of developing or dying
   from CVD. The main focus of data analysis is on the use of models able
   to discover and understand the relationships between different CVRF. In
   this paper a report on applying Bayesian network (BN) modeling to
   discover the relationships among thirteen relevant epidemiological
   features of heart age domain in order to analyze cardiovascular lost
   years (CVLY), cardiovascular risk score (CVRS), and metabolic syndrome
   (MetS) is presented. Furthermore, the induced BN was used to make
   inference taking into account three reasoning patterns: causal
   reasoning, evidential reasoning, and intercausal reasoning. Application
   of BN tools has led to discovery of several direct and indirect
   relationships between different CVRF. The BN analysis showed several
   interesting results, among them: CVLY was highly influenced by smoking
   being the group of men the one with highest risk in CVLY; MetS was
   highly influence by physical activity (PA) being again the group of men
   the one with highest risk in MetS, and smoking did not show any
   influence. BNs produce an intuitive, transparent, graphical
   representation of the relationships between different CVRF. The ability
   of BNs to predict new scenarios when hypothetical information is
   introduced makes BN modeling an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool of
   special interest in epidemiological studies. As CVD is multifactorial
   the use of BNs seems to be an adequate modeling tool. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Modern malware uses advanced techniques to hide from static and dynamic
   analysis tools. To achieve stealthiness when attacking a mobile device,
   an effective approach is the use of a covert channel built by two
   colluding applications to exchange data locally. Since this process is
   tightly coupled with the used hiding method, its detection is a
   challenging task, also worsened by the very low transmission rates. As a
   consequence, it is important to investigate how to reveal the presence
   of malicious software using general indicators, such as the energy
   consumed by the device. In this perspective, this paper aims to spot
   malware covertly exchanging data using two detection methods based on
   artificial intelligence tools, such as neural networks and decision
   trees. To verify their effectiveness, seven covert channels have been
   implemented and tested over a measurement framework using Android
   devices. Experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of
   the proposed approach to detect the hidden data exchange between
   colluding applications.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, artificial intelligence has reached the level of top
   information technologies that will have significant influence over many
   aspects of our future lifestyles. In particular, in the fields of
   machine learning technologies for classification and decision-making,
   there have been a lot of research efforts for solving estimation and
   control problems that appear in the various kinds of portfolio
   management problems via data-driven approaches. Note that these modern
   data-driven approaches, which try to find solutions to the problems
   based on relevant empirical data rather than mathematical analyses, are
   useful particularly in practical application domains. In this paper, we
   consider some applications of modern data-driven machine learning
   methods for portfolio management problems. More precisely, we apply a
   simplified version of the sparse Gaussian process (GP) classification
   method for classifying users' sensitivity with respect to financial
   risk, and then present two portfolio management issues in which the GP
   application results can be useful. Experimental results show that the GP
   applications work well in handling simulated data sets.}},

Abstract = {{The exponential growth in digital technology is leading us to a future
   in which all things and all people are connected all the time, something
   we refer to as The Infinite Network (TIN), which will cause profound
   changes in every industry. Here, we focus on the impact it will have in
   healthcare. TIN will change the essence of healthcare to a data-driven
   continuous approach as opposed to the event-driven discrete approach
   used today. At a micro or individual level, smart sensing will play a
   key role, in the form of embedded sensors, wearable sensors, and sensing
   from smart medical devices. At a macro or aggregate level, healthcare
   will be provided by Intelligent Telehealth Networks that evolve from the
   telehealth networks that are available today. Traditional telemedicine
   has delivered remote care to patients in the area where doctors are not
   readily available, but has not achieved at large scale. New advanced
   networks will deliver care at a much larger scale. The long-term future
   requires intelligent hybrid networks that combine artificial
   intelligence with human intelligence to provide continuity of care at
   higher quality and lower cost than is possible today.}},

Abstract = {{Human interactive proofs (HIPs) are a basic security measure on the
   Internet to avoid automatic attacks. There is an ongoing effort to find
   a HIP that is secure enough yet easy for humans. Recently, a new HIP has
   been designed aiming at higher security: the Civil Rights Completely
   Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart
   (CAPTCHA). It employs the empathy capacity of humans to further
   strengthen Securimage, a well-known text CAPTCHA. In this paper, we
   analyze it from a security perspective, finding fundamental design
   flaws. Using several well-known machine learning (ML) algorithms, we
   analyze to what extent these flaws affect its security. We discover that
   thanks to them, we can create a successful side-channel attack. This
   attack is able to correctly solve the HIP on 20.7\% of occasions, much
   more than enough to consider it broken. Thus, we show that there is no
   need to solve the problem of optical character recognition nor empathy
   analysis for computers to break this particular HIP. ML can be
   successfully used to break a HIP that uses both with a side-channel
   attack. This security analysis can be applied to other HIPs. It will
   allow to test whether they are leaking too much information by
   unexpected ways, given non-evident design flaws. Copyright (c) 2015 John

Title = {{Graded comparison of imprecise fitness values}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{24-32}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Genetic algorithms can be used to construct knowledge bases. They are
   based on the idea of ``survival of the fittest{''} in the same way as
   natural evolution. Nature chooses the fittest ones in real life. In
   artificial intelligence we need a method that carries out the comparison
   and choice. Traditionally, this choice is based on fitness functions.
   Each alternative or possible solution is given a fitness score. If there
   is no ambiguity and those scores are numbers, it is easy to order
   individuals according to those values and determine the fittest ones.
   However, the process of assessing degrees of optimality usually involves
   uncertainty or imprecision.
   In this contribution we discuss the comparison among fitness scores when
   they are known to be in an interval, but the exact value is not given.
   Random variables are used to represent fitness values in this situation.
   Some of the most usual approaches that can be found in the literature
   for the comparison of those kinds of intervals are the strong dominance
   and the probabilistic prior method. In this contribution we consider an
   alternative procedure to order vague fitness values: statistical
   preference. We first study the connection among the three methods
   previously mentioned. Despite they appear to be completely different
   approaches, we will prove some relations among them. We will then focus
   on statistical preference since it takes into consideration the
   information about the relation between the fitness values to compare
   them. We will provide the explicit expression of the probabilistic
   relation associated to statistical preference when the fitness values
   are defined by uniform and beta distributions when they are independent,
   comonotone and countermonotone. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Slope stability assessment is a critical research area in civil
   engineering. Disastrous consequences of slope collapse necessitate
   better tools for predicting their occurrences. This research proposes a
   hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) for slope stability assessment based
   on metaheuristic and machine learning. The contribution of this study to
   the body of knowledge is multifold. First, advantages of the Firefly
   Algorithm (FA) and the Least Squares Support Vector Classification
   (LS-SVC) are combined to establish an integrated slope prediction model.
   Second, an inner cross-validation with the operating characteristic
   curve computation is embedded in the training process to reliably
   construct the machine learning model. Third, the FA, an effective and
   easily implemented metaheuristic, is employed to optimize the model
   construction process by appropriately selecting the LS-SVM's
   hyper-parameters. Finally, a dataset that contains 168 real cases of
   slope evaluation, recorded in various countries, is used to establish
   and confirm the proposed hybrid approach. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the new hybrid Al model has achieved roughly 4\%
   improvement in classification accuracy compared with other benchmark
   methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Convergence analysis for pure stationary strategies in repeated
   potential games: Nash, Lyapunov and correlated equilibria}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{474-484}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{In game theory the interaction among players obligates each player to
   develop a belief about the possible strategies of the other players, to
   choose a best-reply given those beliefs, and to look for an adjustment
   of the best-reply and the beliefs using a learning mechanism until they
   reach an equilibrium point. Usually, the behavior of an individual
   cost-function, when such best-reply strategies are applied, turns out to
   be non-monotonic and concluding that such strategies lead to some
   equilibrium point is a non-trivial task. Even in repeated games the
   convergence to a stationary equilibrium is not always guaranteed. The
   best-reply strategies analyzed in this paper represent the most frequent
   type of behavior applied in practice in problems of bounded rationality
   of agents considered within the Artificial Intelligence research area.
   They are naturally related with the, so-called, fixed-local-optimal
   actions or, in other words, with one step-ahead optimization algorithms
   widely used in the modern Intelligent Systems theory.
   This paper shows that for an ergodic class of finite controllable Markov
   games the best-reply strategies lead necessarily to a Lyapunov/Nash
   equilibrium point. One of the most interesting properties of this
   approach is that an expedient (or absolutely expedient) behavior of an
   ergodic system (repeated game) can be represented by a Lyapunov-like
   function non-decreasing in time. We present a method for constructing a
   Lyapunov-like function: the Lyapunov-like function replaces the
   recursive mechanism with the elements of the ergodic system that model
   how players are likely to behave in one-shot games. To show our
   statement, we first propose a non-converging state-value function that
   fluctuates (increases and decreases) between states of the Markov game.
   Then, we prove that it is possible to represent that function in a
   recursive format using a one-step-ahead fixed-local-optimal strategy. As
   a result, we prove that a Lyapunov-like function can be built using the
   previous recursive expression for the Markov game, i.e., the resulting
   Lyapunov-like function is a monotonic function which can only decrease
   (or remain the same) over time, whatever the initial distribution of
   probabilities. As a result, a new concept called Lyapunov games is
   suggested for a class of repeated games. Lyapunov games allow to
   conclude during the game whether the applied strategy provides the
   convergence to an equilibrium point (or not). The time for constructing
   a Potential (Lyapunov-like) function is exponential. Our algorithm
   tractably computes the Nash, Lyapunov and the correlated equilibria: a
   Lyapunov equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium, as well it is also a
   correlated equilibrium. Validity of the proposed method is successfully
   demonstrated both theoretically and practically by a simulated
   experiment related to the Duel game. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to develop a system capable of performing
   calculation of temporal gait parameters using two low-cost wireless
   accelerometers and artificial intelligence-based techniques as part of a
   larger research project for conducting human gait analysis. Ten healthy
   subjects of different ages participated in this study and performed
   controlled walking tests. Two wireless accelerometers were placed on
   their ankles. Raw acceleration signals were processed in order to obtain
   gait patterns from characteristic peaks related to steps. A Bayesian
   model was implemented to classify the characteristic peaks into steps or
   nonsteps. The acceleration signals were segmented based on gait events,
   such as heel strike and toe-off, of actual steps. Temporal gait
   parameters, such as cadence, ambulation time, step time, gait cycle
   time, stance and swing phase time, simple and double support time, were
   estimated from segmented acceleration signals. Gait data-sets were
   divided into two groups of ages to test Bayesian models in order to
   classify the characteristic peaks. The mean error obtained from
   calculating the temporal gait parameters was 4.6\%. Bayesian models are
   useful techniques that can be applied to classification of gait data of
   subjects at different ages with promising results}},

Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{The dualization in arbitrary posets is a well-studied problem in
   combinatorial enumeration and is a crucial step in many applications in
   logics, databases, artificial intelligence and pattern mining.
   The objective of this paper is to study reductions of the dualization
   problem on arbitrary posets to the dualization problem on boolean
   lattices, for which output quasi-polynomial time algorithms exist,
   Quasi-polynomial time algorithms are algorithms which run in no(logn)
   where n is the size of the input and output. We introduce convex
   embedding and poset reflection as key notions to characterize such
   reductions. As a consequence, we identify posets, which are not boolean
   lattices, for which the dualization problem remains in quasi-polynomial
   time and propose a classification of posets with respect to dualization.
   From these results, we study how they can be applied to maximal pattern
   mining problems. We deduce a new classification of pattern mining
   problems and we point out how known problems involving sequences and
   conjunctive queries patterns, fit into this classification. Finally, we
   explain how to adapt the seminal DUALIZE \& ADVANCE algorithm to deal
   with such patterns.
   As far as we know, this is the first contribution to explicit
   non-trivial reductions for studying the hardness of maximal pattern
   mining problems and to extend the DUALIZE \& ADVANCE algorithm for
   complex patterns. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) optimisation algorithm is a recent, fast and
   easy-to-implement population-based meta heuristic for optimisation. ABC
   has been proved a rival algorithm with some popular swarm
   intelligence-based algorithms such as particle swarm optimisation,
   firefly algorithm and ant colony optimisation. The solution search
   equation of ABC is influenced by a random quantity which helps its
   search process in exploration at the cost of exploitation. In order to
   find a fast convergent behaviour of ABC while exploitation capability is
   maintained, in this paper basic ABC is modified in two ways. First, to
   improve exploitation capability, two local search strategies, namely
   classical unidimensional local search and levy flight random walk-based
   local search are incorporated with ABC. Furthermore, a new solution
   search strategy, namely stochastic diffusion scout search is proposed
   and incorporated into the scout bee phase to provide more chance to
   abandon solution to improve itself. Efficiency of the proposed algorithm
   is tested on 20 benchmark test functions of different complexities and
   characteristics. Results are very promising and they prove it to be a
   competitive algorithm in the field of swarm intelligence-based

Abstract = {{Reconstructing haplotypes from SNP fragments is an important problem in
   computational biology. There have been a lot of interests in this field
   because haplotypes have been shown to contain promising data for disease
   association research. It is proved that haplotype reconstruction in
   Minimum Error Correction model is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, several
   methods such as clustering techniques, evolutionary algorithms, neural
   networks and swarm intelligence approaches have been proposed in order
   to solve this problem in appropriate time. In this paper, we have
   focused on various evolutionary clustering techniques and try to find an
   efficient technique for solving haplotype reconstruction problem. It can
   be referred from our experiments that the clustering methods relying on
   the behaviour of honey bee colony in nature, specifically bees algorithm
   and artificial bee colony methods, are expected to result in more
   efficient solutions. An application program of the methods is available

Abstract = {{A social multi-criteria evaluation framework for solving a real-case
   problem of selecting a wind farm location in the regions of Urgell and
   Conca de Barbera in Catalonia (northeast of Spain) is studied. This
   paper applies a qualitative multi-criteria decision analysis approach
   based on linguistic labels assessment able to address uncertainty and
   deal with different levels of precision. This method is based on
   qualitative reasoning as an artificial intelligence technique for
   assessing and ranking multi-attribute alternatives with linguistic
   labels in order to handle uncertainty. This method is suitable for
   problems in the social framework such as energy planning which require
   the construction of a dialogue process among many social actors with
   high level of complexity and uncertainty. The method is compared with an
   existing approach, which has been applied previously in the wind farm
   location problem. This approach, consisting of an outranking method, is
   based on Condorcet's original method. The results obtained by both
   approaches are analysed and their performance in the selection of the
   wind farm location is compared in aggregation procedures. Although
   results show that both methods conduct to similar alternatives rankings,
   the study highlights both their advantages and drawbacks.}},

Abstract = {{Possibilistic defeasible logic programming (P-DeLP) is a logic
   programming framework which combines features from argumentation theory
   and logic programming, in which defeasible rules are attached with
   weights expressing their relative belief or preference strength. In
   P-DeLP,a conclusion succeeds if there exists an argument that entails
   the conclusion and this argument is found to be undefeated by a warrant
   procedure that systematically explores the universe of arguments in
   order to present an exhaustive synthesis of the relevant chains of pros
   and cons for the given conclusion. Recently, we have proposed a new
   warrant recursive semantics for P-DeLP, called Recursive P-DeLP (RP-DeLP
   for short), based on the claim that the acceptance of an argument should
   imply also the acceptance of all its sub-arguments which reflect the
   different premises on which the argument is based. This paper explores
   the relationship between the exhaustive dialectical analysis-based
   semantics of P-DeLP and the recursive-based semantics of RP-DeLP, and
   analyses a non-monotonic inference operator for RP-DeLP which models the
   expansion of a given program by adding new weighted facts associated
   with warranted conclusions. Given the recursive-based semantics of
   RP-DeLP, we have also implemented an argumentation framework for RP-DeLP
   that is able to compute not only the output of warranted and blocked
   conclusions, but also explain the reasons behind the status of each
   conclusion. We have developed this framework as a stand-alone
   application with a simple text-based input/output interface to be able
   to use it as part of other artificial intelligence systems.}},

Abstract = {{The Gbest-guided artificial bee colony (GABC) algorithm is a latest
   swarm intelligence-based approach to solve optimisation problem. In
   GABC, the individuals update their respective positions by drawing
   inspiration from the global best solution available in the current
   swarm. The GABC is a popular variant of the artificial bee colony (ABC)
   algorithm and is proved to be an efficient algorithm in terms of
   convergence speed. But, in this strategy, each individual is simply
   influenced by the global best solution, which may lead to trap in local
   optima. Therefore, in this paper, a new search strategy, namely ``Fully
   Informed Learning{''} is incorporated in the onlooker bee phase of the
   ABC algorithm. The developed algorithm is named as fully informed
   artificial bee colony (FABC) algorithm. To validate the performance of
   FABC, it is tested on 20 well-known benchmark optimisation problems of
   different complexities. The results are compared with those of GABC and
   some more recent variants of ABC. The results are very promising and
   show that the proposed algorithm is a competitive algorithm in the field
   of swarm intelligence-based algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In order to enable a secure interaction between dynamically discovered
   software services and the client's application in a cooperative
   information system such as service oriented system, one of the
   pre-requisites is the reconciliation of service-specific security
   policies of all stakeholders. Existing service discovery research does
   not address the issue of enormous search space in finding security-aware
   services based on preferred security policy alternatives of the client
   of software services. In this paper, we propose an answer set
   programming (ASP) approach, drawn from the field of artificial
   intelligence (AI), to explore a viable solution of finding
   security-aware services for the client. We argue that the ASP approach
   can significantly reduce the search space and achieve great performance
   gains. We use ASP to: (i) specify security policies including expressing
   service-specific security preference weighting and importance scoring in
   quantifiable terms; and (ii) reason about the compliance between the
   security policies of the client and the software service.}},

Abstract = {{Since last decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been used

   Adaptive Embedded Clonal Evolutionary Programming (AECEP). The objective
   of the study is to employ AECEP optimization techniques for loss
   minimization. This technique was developed to optimally determine the
   location and sizing of DG. The IEEE 41 Bus RTS was implemented for

Abstract = {{While dealing with real world data for classification using ANNs, it is
   often difficult to determine the optimal ANN classification model with
   fast convergence. Also, it is laborious to adjust the set of weights of
   ANNs by using appropriate learning algorithm to obtain better
   classification accuracy. In this paper, a variant of Harmony Search
   (HS), called Global-best Harmony Search along with Gradient Descent
   Learning is used with Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (FLANN)
   for classification task in data mining. The Global-best Harmony Search
   (GbHS) uses the concepts of Particle Swarm Optimization from Swarm
   Intelligence to improve the qualities of harmonies. The problem solving
   strategies of Global-best Harmony Search along with searching
   capabilities of Gradient Descent Search are used to obtain optimal set
   of weight for FLANN. The proposed method (GbHS-GDL-FLANN) is implemented
   in MATLAB and compared with other alternatives (FLANN, GA based FLANN,
   PSO based FLANN, HS based FLANN, Improved HS based FLANN, Self Adaptive
   HS based FLANN, MLP, SVM and FSN). The GbHS-GDL-FLANN is tested on
   benchmark datasets from UCI Machine Learning repository by using 5-fold
   cross validation technique. The proposed method is analyzed under
   null-hypothesis by using Friedman Test, Holm and Hochberg Procedure and
   Post-Hoc ANOVA Statistical Analysis (Tukey Test \& Dunnett Test) for
   statistical analysis and validity of results. Simulation results reveal
   that the performance of the proposed GbHS-GDL-FLANN is better and
   statistically significant from other alternatives. (C) 2015 Production

   and interested metric. Several attempts have been made for efficient
   utilization of energy in routing techniques. This paper proposes an
   energy efficient routing technique for maximizing the networks lifetime
   called swarm intelligence routing. This is achieved by using ant colony
   algorithm (ACO) and artificial immune system (AIS). AIS is used for
   solving packet LOOP problem and to control route direction. While ACO
   algorithm is used for determining optimum route for sending data
   packets. The proposed routing technique seeks for determining the
   optimum route from nodes towards base station so that energy exhaustion
   is balanced and lifetime is maximized. Proposed routing technique is
   compared with Dijkstra routing method. Results show significant increase
   in network lifetime of about 1.2567.}},

Abstract = {{The recent advances in wireless communications require integration of
   multiple network technologies in order to satisfy the increasing demand
   of mobile users. Mobility in such a heterogeneous environment entails
   that users keep moving between the coverage regions of different
   networks, which means that a non-trivial vertical handoff scheme is
   required in order to maintain a seamless transition from one network
   technology to another. A good vertical handoff scheme must provide the
   users with the best possible connection while keeping connection
   dropping probability to the minimum. In this paper, we propose a handoff
   scheme which employs the Markov model to predict the users' future
   locations in order to make better handoff decisions with reduced
   connection dropping probability and number of unnecessary handoffs.
   Through simulation, the proposed scheme is compared with the SINR-based
   scheme, which was shown to outperform other vertical handoff schemes.
   The experiments show that the proposed scheme achieves significant
   improvements over the SINR-based scheme that can reach 51\% in terms of
   the number of failed handoffs and 44\% in terms of the number of
   handoffs.}},

Abstract = {{Our 1997 article in IJAIED reported on a study that showed that a new
   algebra curriculum with an embedded intelligent tutoring system (the
   Algebra Cognitive Tutor) dramatically enhanced high-school students'
   learning. The main motivation for the study was to demonstrate that
   intelligent tutors that have cognitive science research embedded in them
   could have real impact in schools. This study was one of the first
   large-scale classroom evaluations of the integrated use of an
   Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) in high schools. A core challenge was
   figuring out how to embed this new technology into a curriculum and into
   the existing social context of schools. A key element of the study
   design was to include multiple kinds of assessments, including
   standardized test items and items measuring complex problem solving and
   use of representations. The results were powerful: ``On average the 470
   students in experimental classes outperformed students in comparison
   classes by 15 \% on standardized tests and 100 \% on tests targeting the
   {[}course] objectives.{''} We suggested that the study was evidence
   ``that laboratory tutoring systems can be scaled up and made to work,
   both technically and pedagogically, in real and unforgiving settings
   like urban high schools.{''} Since this study, many more classroom
   studies comparing instruction that includes an ITS against business as
   usual have been conducted, often showing advantages for the ITS-enhanced
   curricula. More rigorous randomized field trials are now more
   commonplace, but the approach of using multiple assessments in
   large-scale randomized field trials has not caught on. Cognitive task
   analysis will remain fundamental to the success of ITSs. A key remaining
   question for ITS is to find out how they can be used most effectively to
   support open-ended problem solving, either online or offline. Given all
   the recent excitement around Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), it is
   interesting to note that our field of Artificial Intelligence in
   Education has been making huge, less recognized, progress with impact on
   millions of students and with the majority of those students finishing
   the course!}},

Title = {{Face-to-Face Interaction with Pedagogical Agents, Twenty Years Later}},

Abstract = {{Johnson et al. (International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in
   Education, 11, 47-78, 2000) introduced and surveyed a new paradigm for
   interactive learning environments: animated pedagogical agents. The
   article argued for combining animated interface agent technologies with
   intelligent learning environments, yielding intelligent systems that can
   interact with learners in natural, human-like ways to achieve better
   learning outcomes. We outlined a variety of possible uses for
   pedagogical agents. But we offered only preliminary evidence that they
   improve learning, leaving that to future research and development.
   Twenty years have elapsed since work began on animated pedagogical
   agents. This article re-examines the concepts and predictions in the
   2000 article in the context of the current state of the field. Some of
   the ideas in the paper have become well established and widely adopted,
   especially in game-based learning environments. Others are only now
   being realized, thanks to advances in immersive interfaces and robotics
   that enable rich face-to-face interaction between learners and agents.
   Research has confirmed that pedagogical agents can be beneficial, but
   not equally for all learning problems, applications, and learner
   populations. Although there is a growing body of research findings about
   pedagogical agents, many questions remain and much work remains to be
   done.}},

Abstract = {{This article is a commentary on a model for negotiation in
   teaching-learning dialogues (Baker 1994) that traces its origins and
   developments over the past 20 years. The first main section of the paper
   describes the research background out of which the model arose, within
   the credo of individualised tutoring of the 1980s. This is followed by a
   summary of the main elements of the model, then a presentation of its
   subsequent developments. These comprise the analysis of argumentation
   dialogue and its potential for collaborative learning, the analysis of
   interpersonal relations in relation to the interactive regulation of
   affect, and extensions of the model to other epistemic situations such
   as explanation generation, co-design, online epistemic discussions and
   use of communication interfaces in computer-supported collaborative
   learning environments. On these bases, the object of study of this
   research is defined as the processes of negotiation of meaning in
   epistemic situations. It is concluded that the main core of the model
   was retained, throughout its deepening and extension, but the underlying
   theory was radically changed, from cognitivist belief-systems to a view
   of dialogue itself as collective thinking. Two challenges for artificial
   intelligence and education research are raised: the formalisation of
   interpersonal relations as they are played out in social interaction,
   and the analysis of the processes of appropriation of discourse genres.}},

Title = {{SMILI (sic): a Framework for Interfaces to Learning Data in Open Learner

Abstract = {{The SMILI (sic) (Student Models that Invite the Learner In) Open Learner
   Model Framework was created to provide a coherent picture of the many
   and diverse forms of Open Learner Models (OLMs). The aim was for SMILI
   (sic) to provide researchers with a systematic way to describe, compare
   and critique OLMs. We expected it to highlight those areas where there
   had been considerable OLM work, as well as those that had been
   neglected. However, we observed that SMILI (sic) was not used in these
   ways. We now reflect on the reasons for this, and conclude that it has
   actually served a broader role in defining the notion of OLM and
   informing OLM design. Since the initial SMILI (sic) paper, much has
   changed in technology-enhanced learning. Notably, learning technology
   has become far more pervasive, both in formal and lifelong learning.
   This provides huge, and still growing amounts of learning data. The
   fields of Learning Analytics (LA), Learning at Scale (L@S), Educational
   Data Mining (EDM) and Quantified Self (QS) have emerged. This paper
   argues that there has also been an important shift in the nature and
   role of learner models even within Artificial Intelligence in Education
   and Intelligent Tutoring Systems research. In light of these trends, and
   reflecting on the use of SMILI (sic), this paper presents a revised and
   simpler version of SMILI (sic) alongside the original version. In both
   cases there are additional categories to encompass new trends, which can
   be applied, omitted or substituted as required. We now offer this as a
   guide for designers of interfaces for OLMs, learning analytics and
   related fields, and we highlight the areas where there is need for more
   research.}},

Abstract = {{STyLE-OLM (Dimitrova 2003 International Journal of Artificial

   interactive open learner modelling which entails the development of the
   means by which learners can inspect, discuss and alter the learner model
   that has been jointly constructed by themselves and the system. This
   paper outlines the STyLE-OLM framework and reflects on the key
   challenges it addressed: (a) the design of an appropriate communication
   medium; this was addressed by proposing a structured language using
   diagrammatic representations of conceptual graphs; (b) the management of
   the interaction with the learner; this was addressed by designing a
   framework for interactive open learner modelling dialogue utilising
   dialogue games; (c) the accommodation of different beliefs about the
   learner's domain model; this was addressed with a mechanism for
   maintaining different views about the learner beliefs which adapted
   belief modal logic operators; and (d) the assessment of any resulting
   improvements in learner model accuracy and learner reflection; this was
   addressed in a user study with an instantiation of STyLE-OLM for
   diagnosing a learner's knowledge of finance concept, as part of a larger
   project that developed an intelligent system to assist with learning
   domain terminology in a foreign language. Reviewing follow on work, we
   refer to projects by the authors' students and colleagues leading to
   further extension and adoption of STyLE-OLM, as well as relevant
   approaches in open learner modelling which have cited the STyLE-OLM
   framework. The paper points at outstanding research challenges and
   outlines future a research direction to extend interactive open learner
   modelling towards mentor-like intelligent learning systems.}},

Abstract = {{In industrial domains such as manufacturing control, a trend away from
   centralized planning and scheduling towards more flexible distributed
   agent-based approaches could be observed over recent years. To be of
   practical relevance, the local control mechanisms of the autonomous
   agents must be able to dependably adhere and dynamically adjust to
   complex numeric goal systems like business key performance indicators in
   an economically beneficial way. However, planning with numeric state
   variables and objectives still poses a challenging task within the field
   of artificial intelligence (AI).
   In this article, a new general-purpose AI planning approach is presented
   that operates in two stages and extends existing domain-independent
   modeling formalisms like PDDL with continuous (i.e., infinite-domain)
   numeric action parameters, which are currently still unsupported by
   state-of-the-art AI planners. In doing so, it enables the solution of
   mathematical optimization problems at the action level of the planning
   tasks, which are inherent to many real-world control problems. To deal
   with certain difficulties concerning reliable and fast detection of
   action applicability that arise when planning with real-valued action
   parameters, the implemented planner allows resorting to an adjustable
   ``satisficing{''} strategy by means of partial execution and subsequent
   repair of infeasible plans over the course of time. The functioning of
   the system is evaluated in a multi-agent simulation of a shop floor
   control scenario with focus on the effects the possible problem cases
   and different degrees of satisficing have on attained plan quality and
   total planning time. As the results demonstrate the basic practicability
   of the approach for the given setting, this contribution constitutes an
   important step towards the effective and dependable integration of
   complex numeric goal systems and non-linear multi-criteria optimization
   tasks into autonomous agent-controlled industrial processes in a
   reusable, domain-independent way. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Due to its very peculiar features, the development of e-skin can be
   effectively tackled using a holistic approach. Starting from the
   definition of system specifications, the mechanical arrangement of the
   skin itself needs to be designed and fabricated together with the
   electronic embedded system, to move towards aspects such as tactile data
   processing algorithms and the communication channel interface.
   In this paper we present the design, the implementation and the results
   on the way of the development of an electronic skin (e-skin) system
   based on arrays of piezopolymer transducers. Focus of the paper is on
   both the development of innovative approaches for tactile information
   processing and electronic system embedding into the e-skin structure. In
   particular, Machine Learning technologies can provide a powerful tool to
   tackle the pattern-recognition problems involved in the tactile sensing
   framework and the ability of processing data represented as N-th order
   tensor is the key aspect of the presented research, which can be seen as
   an application of an existing method (Signoretto et al., 2011). The
   experimental session compares two different implementations of the
   ML-based framework, which differ in the learning paradigm adopted,
   namely SVM and ELM (K-ELM). The effectiveness of the adopted
   pattern-recognition technologies in the classification of touch
   modalities has been confirmed by addressing two different binary
   classification problems in an experiment involving 70 participants. The
   computational requirements for the hardware implementation of the
   proposed algorithm together with an overview of what exists in the
   existing literature are finally discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{As practitioners of an historical discipline, archaeologists are in
   general, interested in guessing how ancient objects, buildings and/or
   landscapes were produced and used in the past from the object's visual
   appearance and material properties. In the pursuit of this general goal,
   archaeologists act as detectives looking for material cues (mostly
   visual) that may allow the discovering of social actions that may have
   happened in the past. This investigation can be made intuitively, but
   also formally, in which case we need computational tools and techniques
   to 1) extract necessary information from visual and non-visual data, 2)
   data processing to evaluate relevant relationships between different
   items at different spatial and temporal scales, 3) build appropriate
   models that can be used to provide explanatory hypothesis about the
   human past. In this paper I review the nature of archaeological problems
   and suggest computational techniques and methods that can be useful in
   solving these kinds of questions. Emphasis is made on modern
   classification and clustering techniques (neural networks, for
   instance), and computational simulation approaches.}},

Pages = {{37-46}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: In this paper we propose artificial intelligence methods to
   estimate cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in free-living using wearable
   sensor data.
   Methods: Our methods rely on a computational framework able to
   contextualize heart rate (HR) in free-living, and use context-specific
   HR as predictor of CRF without need for laboratory tests. In particular,
   we propose three estimation steps. Initially, we recognize activity
   primitives using accelerometer and location data. Using topic models, we
   group activity primitives and derive activities composites. We
   subsequently rank activity composites, and analyze the relation between
   ranked activity composites and CRF across individuals. Finally, HR data
   in specific activity primitives and composites is used as predictor in a
   hierarchical Bayesian regression model to estimate CRF level from the
   participant's habitual behavior in free-living.
   Results: We show that by combining activity primitives and activity
   composites the proposed framework can adapt to the user and context, and
   outperforms other CRF estimation models, reducing estimation error
   between 10.3\% and 22.6\% on a study population of 46 participants.
   Conclusions: Our investigation showed that HR can be contextualized in
   free-living using activity primitives and activity composites and robust
   CRF estimation in free-living is feasible. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   online advertising sales platform, which identifies the optimal way of
   promoting a given product. The platform executes, evaluates, manages and
   optimizes display advertising campaigns, all in real-time. The empirical
   analysis carried out in the case study reveals that the platform and its
   exclusion algorithms are suitable mechanisms for analysing the
   performance and efficiency of the various segments that might be used to

Abstract = {{The analysis of the text content in emails, blogs, tweets, forums and
   other forms of textual communication constitutes what we call text
   analytics. Text analytics is applicable to most industries: it can help
   analyze millions of emails; you can analyze customers' comments and
   questions in forums; you can perform sentiment analysis using text
   analytics by measuring positive or negative perceptions of a company,
   brand, or product. Text Analytics has also been called text mining, and
   is a subcategory of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, which
   is one of the founding branches of Artificial Intelligence, back in the
   1950s, when an interest in understanding text originally developed.
   Currently Text Analytics is often considered as the next step in Big
   Data analysis. Text Analytics has a number of subdivisions: Information
   Extraction, Named Entity Recognition, Semantic Web annotated domain's
   representation, and many more. Several techniques are currently used and
   some of them have gained a lot of attention, such as Machine Learning,
   to show a semisupervised enhancement of systems, but they also present a
   number of limitations which make them not always the only or the best
   choice. We conclude with current and near future applications of Text
   Analytics.}},

Abstract = {{The present study integrates co-kriging as spatial estimator and
   self-organizing map (SOM) as clustering technique to identify spatially
   homogeneous clusters of groundwater quality data and to choose the most
   effective input data for feed-forward neural network (FFNN) model to
   simulate electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS)
   of groundwater. The methodology is presented in three stages. In the
   first stage, a geostatistics approach of co-kriging is used to estimate
   groundwater quality parameters at locations where the groundwater levels
   are measured. In stage two, a SOM clustering technique is used to
   identify spatially homogeneous clusters of groundwater quality data. The
   dominant input data, selected by spatial clustering and mutual
   information are then imposed into the FFNN model for one-step-ahead
   predictions of groundwater quality parameters at stage three. The
   performance of the newly proposed model is compared to a conventional
   linear forecasting method of multiple linear regression (MLR). The
   results suggest that the proposed model decreases dimensionality of the
   input layer and consequently the complexity of the FFNN model with
   acceptable efficiency in spatiotemporal simulation of groundwater
   quality parameters. The application of FFNN for modeling EC and TDS
   parameters increases the accuracy of predictions respectively up to
   84.5\% and 17\% on average with regard to the MLR model.}},

Abstract = {{Bibliometrics are important evaluation tools to the scientific
   production. A bibliometric study was used to evaluate researches about
   credit risk and bankruptcy. Credit support technique studies on economic
   and social orders are relevant in this knowledge field. Therefore, the
   aim of the current study is to identify and describe the application of
   multivariate data analysis techniques to credit risk and bankruptcy
   scenarios. The herein presented data were collected in publications
   indexed to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science database between 1968 and
   2014. The results corroborate information in the literature and in
   previous bibliometric reviews, as well as highlight other indications
   regarding the construction and development of research fields. Since the
   1990's, the neural networks became relevant due to their increased use
   as study object in publications. However, both the discriminant analysis
   (J Finance 23(4): 589-609, 1968. doi: 10.2307/2978933) and the logistic
   regression (J Account Res 18(1): 109-131, 1980. doi: 10.2307/2490395)
   are still often used in researches, fact that shows the tendency to find
   articles using more than one technique or hybrid models, artificial
   intelligence techniques and complex computer systems. This field appears
   to be multidisciplinary in journals and Web Science databases involving
   the business and economy, operational research, management, mathematics,
   data processing, engineering and statistics fields. Another relevant
   discovery was the increased number of publications about this subject
   launched right after the 2008 crisis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Sciento-text framework to characterize and assess

   rank universities either on their overall research performance or on a

   research centres at a more fine-grained level of research themes of a
   subject. Computer science (CS) research output of more than 400
   universities in the world is taken as the case in point to demonstrate
   the working of the framework. The Sciento-text framework comprises of
   standard scientometric and text analytics components. First of all every
   research paper in the data is classified into different thematic areas
   in a systematic manner and then standard scientometric methodology is
   used to identify and assess research strengths of different institutions
   in a particular research theme (say Artificial Intelligence for CS
   domain). The performance of framework components is evaluated and the
   complete system is deployed on the Web at url: www.

Abstract = {{The paper considers the forecasting of the euro/Polish zloty (EUR/PLN)
   spot exchange rate by applying state space wavelet network and
   econometric forecast combination models. Both prediction methods are
   applied to produce one-trading-dayahead forecasts of the EUR/PLN
   exchange rate. The paper presents the general state space wavelet
   network and forecast combination models as well as their underlying
   principles. The state space wavelet network model is, in contrast to
   econometric forecast combinations, a non-parametric prediction technique
   which does not make any distributional assumptions regarding the
   underlying input variables. Both methods can be used as forecasting
   tools in portfolio investment management, asset valuation, IT security
   and integrated business risk intelligence in volatile market conditions.}},

   Standardized Tests as a Measure of AI}},

Abstract = {{Given the well-known limitations of the Turing test, there is a need for
   objective tests to both focus attention on, and measure progress toward,
   the goals of AI. In this paper we argue that machine performance on
   standardized tests should be a key component of any new measure of AI,
   because attaining a high level of performance requires solving
   significant AI problems involving language understanding and world
   modeling critical skills for any machine that lays claim to
   intelligence. In addition, standardized tests have all the basic
   requirements of a practical test: they are accessible, easily
   comprehensible, clearly measurable, and offer a graduated progression
   from simple tasks to those requiring deep understanding of the world.
   Here we propose this task as a challenge problem for the community,
   summarize our state-of-the-art results on math and science tests, and
   provide supporting data sets (www.allenai.org).}},

Abstract = {{kappa-labs is a research project exploring the possibilities of the
   logic programming paradigm in bot behavior programming for first-person
   shooter (FPS) games. The focus of previous work was to make Prolog a
   usable tool for bot programming and a baseline for further extensions.
   This paper presents one such extension, which makes it possible to
   script tactics of the entire team of bots. The algorithm was tested by
   bot-to-bot computer tests and by running surveys among human players who
   volunteered to take part in the research. The results of the both tests
   are presented in this paper. The extension itself demonstrates the
   flexibility of the framework. Although the proposed method for defining
   team behaviors relies solely on the knowledge of the bot's designer,
   alternative approaches, which use rules that are obtained by
   computational techniques, can also be developed. Such approaches are
   also being investigated as part of the kappa-labs project.}},

   artificial intelligence on educational processes. Regarding this
   viewpoint, some supervised learning models which is able to recognize
   the learning concepts from a given educational content presented to a
   tutoring system has been designed, in this study. For this aim, firstly,
   three different corpora constructed from educational contents related to
   the subject titles such as calculus, abstract algebra and computer
   science have been composed. For each candidate learning concepts, the
   feature vectors have been generated using a relation factor in addition
   to tf-idf values. The relation factor is defined as the ratio of the
   total number of the most frequent substrings in the corpus that appear
   with a candidate concept in the same sentence within an educational
   content to most frequent substring in the corpus. The achievement of
   this system is measured according to the F-measure.}},

Abstract = {{Tuberculosis is a major global health problem that has been ranked as
   the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide,
   after the human immunodeficiency virus. Diagnosis based on cultured
   specimens is the reference standard; however, results take weeks to
   obtain. Slow and insensitive diagnostic methods hampered the global
   control of tuberculosis, and scientists are looking for early detection
   strategies, which remain the foundation of tuberculosis control.
   Consequently, there is a need to develop an expert system that helps
   medical professionals to accurately diagnose the disease. The objective
   of this study is to diagnose tuberculosis using a machine learning
   method. Artificial immune recognition system (AIRS) has been used
   successfully for diagnosing various diseases. However, little effort has
   been undertaken to improve its classification accuracy. In order to
   increase the classification accuracy, this study introduces a new hybrid
   system that incorporates real tournament selection mechanism into the
   AIRS. This mechanism is used to control the population size of the model
   and to overcome the existing selection pressure. Patient epacris reports
   obtained from the Pasteur laboratory in northern Iran were used as the
   benchmark data set. The sample consisted of 175 records, from which 114
   (65 \%) were positive for TB, and the remaining 61 (35 \%) were
   negative. The classification performance was measured through tenfold
   cross-validation, root-mean-square error, sensitivity, and specificity.
   With an accuracy of 100 \%, RMSE of 0, sensitivity of 100 \%, and
   specificity of 100 \%, the proposed method was able to successfully
   classify tuberculosis cases. In addition, the proposed method is
   comparable with top classifiers used in this research.}},

Abstract = {{Aerial imagery captured via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is playing
   an increasingly important role in disaster response. Unlike satellite
   imagery, aerial imagery can be captured and processed within hours
   rather than days. In addition, the spatial resolution of aerial imagery
   is an order of magnitude higher than the imagery produced by the most
   sophisticated commercial satellites today. Both the United States
   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the European Commission's
   Joint Research Center (JRC) have noted that aerial imagery will
   inevitably present a big data challenge. The purpose of this article is
   to get ahead of this future challenge by proposing a hybrid
   crowdsourcing and real-time machine learning solution to rapidly process
   large volumes of aerial data for disaster response in a time-sensitive
   manner. Crowdsourcing can be used to annotate features of interest in
   aerial images (such as damaged shelters and roads blocked by debris).
   These human-annotated features can then be used to train a supervised
   machine learning system to learn to recognize such features in new
   unseen images. In this article, we describe how this hybrid solution for
   image analysis can be implemented as a module (i.e., Aerial Clicker) to
   extend an existing platform called Artificial Intelligence for Disaster
   Response (AIDR), which has already been deployed to classify microblog
   messages during disasters using its Text Clicker module and in response
   to Cyclone Pam, a category 5 cyclone that devastated Vanuatu in March
   2015. The hybrid solution we present can be applied to both aerial and
   satellite imagery and has applications beyond disaster response such as
   wildlife protection, human rights, and archeological exploration. As a
   proof of concept, we recently piloted this solution using very
   high-resolution aerial photographs of a wildlife reserve in Namibia to
   support rangers with their wildlife conservation efforts (SAVMAP
   project, http://lasig.epfl.ch/savmap). The results suggest that the
   platform we have developed to combine crowdsourcing and machine learning
   to make sense of large volumes of aerial images can be used for disaster
   response.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an electromagnetic-artificial intelligence design
   optimization approach of a wireless power transfer link (WPTL).
   Electromagnetic solutions from a 3-DFE model of the WPTL were utilized
   to minimize the field signature around each design while maintaining
   high efficiency. The reduced field signatures around the WPTL would
   enable the achievement of designs that are in accordance with
   international electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards such as
   international commission on non-ionizing radiation protection guidelines
   with respect to public exposure levels of EM signatures below 27 mu T.
   As the optimization process involved utilizing a large number of fitness
   function evaluations, numerous 3-DFE solutions were required increasing
   the computational burden. Artificial neural networks were developed,
   trained, and used to produce the required equivalent 3-DFE solutions to
   evaluate the fitness function. As a result, this process significantly
   reduced the computational time by nearly 90\%. The genetic
   algorithm-based optimization process yielded the desired results of
   electromagnetically compatible WPTL designs at the early development
   stage satisfying EMC standards.}},

Abstract = {{As a relatively new global optimization technique, artificial bee colony
   (ABC) algorithm becomes popular in recent years for its simplicity and
   effectiveness. However, there is still an inefficiency in ABC regarding
   its solution search equation, which is good at exploration but poor at
   exploitation. To overcome this drawback, a Gaussian barebones ABC is
   proposed, where a new search equation is designed based on utilizing the
   global best solution. Furthermore, we employ the generalized
   opposition-based learning strategy to generate new food sources for
   scout bees, which is beneficial to discover more useful information for
   guiding search. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted on 23
   benchmark functions and a real-world optimization problem to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach. Some well-known ABC variants and
   state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms are used for comparison. The
   experimental results show that the proposed approach offers higher
   solution quality and faster convergence speed.}},

Abstract = {{This work is a hybrid architecture design furnished successfully using
   artificial intelligence techniques, rough data sets theory and machine
   learning algorithms. The purpose of this work is to bring the spotless
   and smart approach in identifying the thyroid disease in a human. There
   are several mechanisms implemented on thyroid data sets which produced
   astonished outcomes, but the data considered for the thyroid disease
   diagnoses (TDD) is inconsistent, redundant and consists of missing
   attribute values as per my literature survey. The proposed work is to
   construct an expert advisory system of hybrid architecture, which is to
   determine the optimistic disease growth because of the thyroid gland. A
   string matching system (SMS) was at the outset developed, which can
   predict the actual TDD based on the knowledge available. If the SMS
   fails, an individual approaches using artificial bee colony optimization
   and particle swarm optimization are developed to achieve the accuracy of
   results appreciating the measure values as 65 and 93 \%, but the results
   obtained using the above said approaches are calculated using some
   missed attribute values which are not included in the knowledge likewise
   left blank and hence the proposed work continues to first generate the
   missing attribute value in the knowledge by using rough data sets theory
   and the obtained data (missed attribute values) is given to predict
   optimistic disease along with its prevention and its curing methods.
   However, the data generated cannot predict the optimal disease and hence
   it is proposed to use a machine learning algorithm so that, obtained
   result is hygienic. The knowledge for implementation of this work is
   gathered from Intelligent System Laboratory of K. N. Toosi University of
   Technology, ImamKhomeini Hospital. Aquestionnaire form is developed for
   providing an interface for user so they can contribute the data.}},

Abstract = {{Argumentation theory is an area of interdisciplinary research that is
   suitable to characterise several diverse situations of reasoning and
   judgement in real world practices and challenges. In the discipline of
   Artificial Intelligence, argumentation is formalised by reasoning models
   based on building and evaluation of interacting arguments. In this
   argumentation framework, the semantics of acceptance plays a fundamental
   role in the argument evaluation process. The determination of accepted
   arguments under a given semantics (admissible, preferred, stable, etc.)
   can be a time-consuming and tedious (in number of steps) process. In
   this work we try to overcome this substantial process by providing a
   method to compute accepted arguments from an argumentation framework.
   The principle of this method is to combine mathematical properties (e.g.
   symmetry, asymmetry, strong connectivity and irreflexivity) of graphs
   built from the argumentation system to compute sets of accepted
   arguments. In this work, we combine several graph properties to provide
   three main propositions; one for identifying accepted arguments under
   the admissible, preferred semantics and the other to easily identify
   stable extension. The proofs of the suggested propositions are detailed
   and this is part of an approach designed to increase collaborative
   decision-making by improving the effectiveness of reasoning processes.

Abstract = {{Visual object tracking is a challenging task because designing an

   authors propose a simple and efficient tracking algorithm with a
   deformable structure appearance. In their method, model updates with
   continuous labelled samples which are dense sampling. To improve the
   accuracy, they introduce a coupled-layer regression model which prevents
   negative background from impacting on the model learning rather than
   traditional classification. The proposed deformable structure regression
   tracker runs in real time and performs favourably against

Title = {{Semantic NLP-Based Information Extraction from Construction Regulatory
   Documents for Automated Compliance Checking}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Automated regulatory compliance checking requires automated extraction
   of requirements from regulatory textual documents and their
   formalization in a computer-processable rule representation. Such
   information extraction (IE) is a challenging task that requires complex
   analysis and processing of text. Natural language processing (NLP) aims
   to enable computers to process natural language text in a human-like
   manner. This paper proposes a semantic, rule-based NLP approach for
   automated IE from construction regulatory documents. The proposed
   approach uses a set of pattern-matching-based IE rules and conflict
   resolution (CR) rules in IE. A variety of syntactic
   (syntax/grammar-related) and semantic (meaning/context-related) text
   features are used in the patterns of the IE and CR rules. Phrase
   structure grammar (PSG)-based phrasal tags and separation and sequencing
   of semantic information elements are proposed and used to reduce the
   number of needed patterns. An ontology is used to aid in the recognition
   of semantic text features (concepts and relations). The proposed IE
   algorithms were tested in extracting quantitative requirements from the
   2009 International Building Code and achieved 0.969 and 0.944 precision
   and recall, respectively. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is a methodology and not a technology. Adaptation of
   cloud computing services for robotic applications is relatively
   straightforward while adaptation of underlying ideas will require a new
   design attitude. Cloud computing is a cost-effective and dynamic
   business model. Currently cloud robotics is understood as a client
   server methodology which enables robots utilize resources and services
   placed at centralized servers. These cloud servers treat robots as any
   other client computer offering them platform, infrastructure, process or
   algorithm as a service. HTM5 is an OMG MDA based multi-view meta-model
   for agent oriented development of cloud robotic systems. HTM5 encourages
   design of peer-to-peer service ecosystems based on an open registry and
   matchmaking mechanism. In peer-to-peer cloud robotics, a robot can trade
   its hardware, software and functional resources as a service to other
   robots in the ecosystem. The peer-to-peer trade in such systems may be
   driven by contracts and relationships between its member agents. This
   article discusses trade-view model of HTM5 methodology and its use in
   developing a cloud robotic ecosystem that implements peer-to-peer,
   contract based economy. The article also presents a case study with
   experiments that implement distributed artificial intelligence and
   peer-to-peer service oriented trade on simulated and real robot
   colonies.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-heuristicalgorithms are widely used in various areas such as
   engineering, statistics, industrial, image processing, artificial

   nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm approach which can be used for
   the solution of some global engineering optimization problems was
   introduced. This novel approach is a meta-heuristic method that arose
   from the inspiration of the behaviour of crickets in the nature. It has
   a structure for the use in the solution of various problems. In the
   development stage of the algorithm, the good aspects of the Bat,
   Particle Swarm Optimization and Firefly were experimented for being
   applied to this algorithm. In addition to this, because of the fact that
   these insects intercommunicate through sound, the physical principles of
   sound propagation in the nature were practiced in the algorithm. Thanks
   to this, the compliance of the algorithm to real life tried to be
   provided. This new developed approach was applied on the familiar global
   engineering problems and the obtained results were compared with the

Abstract = {{StarCraft is a well-known real-time strategy game developed by Blizzard
   Entertainment in 1998. One of the characteristics of this game is ``fog
   of war,{''} which refers to the fact that players cannot see their
   opponents' regions but only their own unit. This characteristic of the
   game means that the information required in order to predicting the
   opponent's strategy is only available through ``scouting.{''}Although
   the `` fog of war{''} is one of the most important features of the game,
   it has not been deeply understood in the design of artificial
   intelligence. In this work, we propose to investigate the effect of the
   `` fog of war{''} in the prediction of opponent's strategy using machine
   learning for human players and artificial intelligence (AI) bots. To
   realize this analysis, we develop a customized replay analyzer that
   exports the internal game events with/without the fog of war. In the
   experimental results, we collect replays from various sources: human vs.
   human, human vs. AI bots, and AI bots vs. AI bots. This systematic
   analysis with `` fog of war{''} reveals the predictability of the
   machine-learning algorithms on different conditions and the directions
   for designing new artificial intelligence for the game.}},

Journal = {{FUTURE INTERNET}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Most of the existing research works on the intrusion detection problem
   in a wireless sensor network (WSN) assume linear or random mobility
   patterns in abstracting intruders' models in traversing the WSN field.
   However, in real-life WSN applications, an intruder is usually an
   intelligent mobile robot with environment learning and detection
   avoidance capability (i.e., the capability to avoid surrounding
   sensors). Due to this, the literature results based on the linear or
   random mobility models may not be applied to the real-life WSN design
   and deployment for efficient and effective intrusion detection in
   practice. This motivates us to investigate the impact of intruder's
   intelligence on the intrusion detection problem in a WSN for various
   applications. To be specific, we propose two intrusion algorithms, the
   pinball and flood-fill algorithms, to mimic the intelligent motion and
   behaviors of a mobile intruder in detecting and circumventing nearby
   sensors for detection avoidance while heading for its destination. The
   two proposed algorithms are integrated into a WSN framework for
   intrusion detection analysis in various circumstances. Monte Carlo
   simulations are conducted, and the results indicate that: (1) the
   performance of a WSN drastically changes as a result of the intruder's
   intelligence in avoiding sensor detections and intrusion algorithms; (2)
   network parameters, including node density, sensing range and
   communication range, play a crucial part in the effectiveness of the
   intruder's intrusion algorithms; and (3) it is imperative to integrate
   intruder's intelligence in the WSN research for intruder detection
   problems under various application circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{This paper details the development of a new evaluation framework for a
   text based Conversational Agent (CA). A CA is an intelligent system that
   handle spoken or/and text based conversations between machine and human.
   Generally, the lack of evaluation frameworks for CAs effects its
   development. The idea behind any system's evaluation is to make sure
   about the system's functionalities and to continue development on it. A
   specific CA has been chosen to test the proposed framework on it; namely
   ArabChat. The ArabChat is a rule based CA and uses pattern matching
   technique to handle user's Arabic text based conversations. The proposed
   and developed evaluation framework in this paper is natural language
   independent. The proposed framework is based on the exchange of specific
   information between ArabChat and user called ``Information
   Requirements{''}. This information are tagged for each rule in the
   applied domain and should be exist in a user's utterance (conversation).
   A real experiment has been done in Applied Science University in Jordan
   as an information point advisor for their native Arabic students to
   evaluate the ArabChat and then evaluating the proposed evaluation
   framework.}},

   artificial intelligence optimization technique in three phases. First,
   the AOPCW is optimized to maximize normalized delay-bandwidth product.
   Second, it is optimized with respect to two objectives: averaged of
   group index ((n) over bar (g)) and normalized bandwidth (Delta
   omega/omega(0)). Third, group velocity dispersion is also considered in
   addition to the two objectives in the second phase, so AOPCW is
   optimized with respect to three objectives. In all of the three phases,
   a band mixing avoidance mechanism is also considered and handled. The
   comparative study of the optimized designs proves that the proposed
   AOPCW is able to substantially outperform the current PCW structures in
   the literature. This paper also considers and discusses time-domain
   simulation issues of the PCW-based optical buffer.}},

Abstract = {{Text mining or knowledge discovery is that sub process of data mining,
   which is widely being used to discover hidden patterns and significant
   information from the huge amount of unstructured written material. The

Title = {{A self adaptive harmony search based functional link higher order ANN
   for non-linear data classification}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{69-87}},
Month = {{FEB 29}},
Abstract = {{In the data classification process involving higher order ANNs, it's a
   herculean task to determine the optimal ANN classification model due to
   non-linear nature of real world datasets. To add to the woe, it is
   tedious to adjust the set of weights of ANNs by using appropriate
   learning algorithm to obtain better classification accuracy. In this
   paper, an improved variant of harmony search (HS), called self-adaptive
   harmony search (SANS) along with gradient descent learning is used with
   functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) for the task of
   classification in data mining. Using its past experiences, SAHS adjusts
   the harmonies according to the maximum and minimum values in the current
   harmony memory. The powerful combination of this unique strategy of SANS
   and searching capabilities of gradient descent search is used to obtain
   optimal set of weights for FLANN. The proposed method (SAHS-FLANN) is
   implemented in MATLAB and the results are contrasted with other
   alternatives (FIANN, GA based FLANN, PSO based FLANN, HS based FLANN,
   improved HS based FIANN and TIBO based FLANN). To illustrate its
   effectiveness, SAHS-FLANN is tested on various benchmark datasets from
   UCI machine learning repository by using 5-fold cross validation
   technique. Under the null hypothesis, the proposed method is analyzed by
   using various statistical tests for statistical correctness of results.
   The performance of the SAHS-FLANN is found to be better and
   statistically significant in comparison with other alternatives. The
   SAHS-FLANN differs from HS-FLANN (HS based FIANN) by the elimination of
   constant parameters (bandwidth and pitch adjustment rate). Furthermore,
   it leads to the simplification of steps for the improvisation of
   weight-sets in IHS-FLANN (improved HS based FLANN) by incorporating
   adjustments of new weight-sets according to the weight-sets with maximum
   and minimum fitness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mutation and natural selection is the core of Darwin's idea about
   evolution. Many algorithms and models are based on this idea. However,
   in the evolution of prokaryotes, more and more researches have indicated
   that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) would be much more important and
   universal than the authors had imagined. Owing to this mechanism, the
   prokaryotes not only become adaptable in nearly any environment on
   Earth, but also form a global genetic bank and a super communication
   network with all the genes of the prokaryotic world. Under this
   background, they present a novel cellular automata model general gene
   transfer to simulate and study the vertical gene transfer and HGT in the
   prokaryotes. At the same time, they use Schrodinger's life theory to
   formulate some evaluation indices and to discuss the intelligence and
   cognition of prokaryotes which is derived from HGT.}},

Abstract = {{The constant expansion of solar energy has made the accurate forecasting
   of radiation an important issue. In this work we apply Support Vector
   Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosted Regression (GBR), Random Forest
   Regression (RFR) as well as a hybrid method to combine them to downscale
   and improve 3-h accumulated radiation forecasts provided by Numerical
   Weather Prediction (NWP) systems for seven locations in Spain. We use
   either direct 3-h aggregated radiation forecasts or we build first
   global accumulated daily predictions and disaggregate them into 3-h
   values, with both approaches out-performing the base NWP forecasts. We
   also show how to disaggregate the 3-h forecasts into hourly values using
   interpolation based on clear sky (CS) theoretical and experimental
   radiation models, with the disaggregated forecasts again being better
   than the base NWP ones and where empirical CS interpolation yields the
   best results. Besides providing ample background on a problem that
   offers many opportunities to the Machine Learning (ML) community, our
   study shows that ML methods or, more generally, hybrid artificial
   intelligence systems are quite effective and, hence, relevant for solar
   radiation prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An early detection and reeducation of dyslexic children is critical for
   their integration in the classroom. Parents and instructors can help the
   psychologist to detect potential cases of dyslexia before the children's

   Dyslexia symptoms are detected with tests whose results may be vague or
   ambiguous, thus machine learning techniques for low quality data are
   advised. In particular, in this paper it is suggested that a new
   extension to vague datasets of the classification algorithm FURIA (Fuzzy
   Unordered Rule Induction Algorithm) has advantages over other approaches
   in both the computational effort during the learning stage and the
   linguistic quality of the induced classification rules. The new approach
   is benchmarked with different test problems and compared to other

Abstract = {{The brain-computer interface (BCI) has made remarkable progress in the
   bridging the divide between the brain and the external environment to
   assist persons with severe disabilities caused by brain impairments.
   There is also continuing philosophical interest in BCIs which emerges
   from thoughtful reflection on computers, machines, and artificial
   intelligence. This article seeks to apply BCI perspectives to examine,
   challenge, and work towards a possible resolution to a persistent
   problem in the mind-body relationship, namely dualism. The original
   humanitarian goals of BCIs and the technological inventiveness result in
   BCIs being surprisingly useful. We begin from the neurologically
   impaired person, the problems encountered, and some pioneering responses
   from computers and machines. Secondly, the interface of mind and brain
   is explored via two points of clarification: direct and indirect BCIs,
   and the nature of thoughts. Thirdly, dualism is beset by mind-body
   interaction difficulties and is further questioned by the phenomena of
   intentions, interactions, and technology. Fourthly, animal minds and
   robots are explored in BCI settings again with relevance for dualism.
   After a brief look at other BCIs, we conclude by outlining a future BCI
   philosophy of brain and mind, which might appear ominous and could be
   possible.}},

Abstract = {{Smartphones and mobile tablets are rapidly becoming indispensable in
   daily life. Android has been the most popular mobile operating system
   since 2012. However, owing to the open nature of Android, countless
   malwares are hidden in a large number of benign apps in Android markets
   that seriously threaten Android security. Deep learning is a new area of
   machine learning research that has gained increasing attention in
   artificial intelligence. In this study, we propose to associate the
   features from the static analysis with features from dynamic analysis of
   Android apps and characterize malware using deep learning techniques. We
   implement an online deep-learning-based Android malware detection engine
   (DroidDetector) that can automatically detect whether an app is a
   malware or not. With thousands of Android apps, we thoroughly test
   DroidDetector and perform an indepth analysis on the features that deep
   learning essentially exploits to characterize malware. The results show
   that deep learning is suitable for characterizing Android malware and
   especially effective with the availability of more training data.
   DroidDetector can achieve 96.76\% detection accuracy, which outperforms
   traditional machine learning techniques. An evaluation of ten popular
   anti-virus softwares demonstrates the urgency of advancing our

Abstract = {{Within the Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) context, a methodology
   that has proven to be particularly performant consists of using a
   portfolio of different constraint solvers. Nevertheless, comparatively
   few studies and investigations have been done in the world of Constraint
   Optimization Problems (COP). In this work, we provide a generalization
   to COP as well as an empirical evaluation of different state of the art
   existing CSP portfolio approaches properly adapted to deal with COP. The
   results obtained by measuring several evaluation metrics confirm the
   effectiveness of portfolios even in the optimization field, and could
   give rise to some interesting future research.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial Intelligence allows the improvement of our daily life, for
   instance, speech and handwritten text recognition, real time translation
   and weather forecasting are common used applications. In the livestock
   sector, machine learning algorithms have the potential for early
   detection and warning of problems, which represents a significant
   milestone in the poultry industry. Production problems generate economic
   loss that could be avoided by acting in a timely manner.
   In the current study, training and testing of support vector machines
   are addressed, for an early detection of problems in the production
   curve of commercial eggs, using farm's egg production data of 478,919
   laying hens grouped in 24 flocks.
   Experiments using support vector machines with a 5 k-fold
   cross-validation were performed at different previous time intervals, to
   alert with up to 5 days of forecasting interval, whether a flock will
   experience a problem in production curve. Performance metrics such as
   accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value were
   evaluated, reaching 0-day values of 0.9874, 0.9876, 0.9783 and 0.6518
   respectively on unseen data (test-set).
   The optimal forecasting interval was from zero to three days,
   performance metrics decreases as the forecasting interval is increased.
   It should be emphasized that this technique was able to issue an alert a
   day in advance, achieving an accuracy of 0.9854, a specificity of
   0.9865, a sensitivity of 0.9333 and a positive predictive value of
   0.6135. This novel application embedded in a computer system of poultry
   management is able to provide significant improvements in early
   detection and warning of problems related to the production curve. (C)

Abstract = {{The last two decades have seen a number of developments in creating
   robots to play billiards. The designed robotic systems have successfully
   incorporated the kinematics required and have had appropriate machine
   vision elements for a decent gameplay. Independently, computer
   scientists have also developed the artificial intelligence programs
   needed for the strategy to play billiards. Despite these developments,
   the accurate ball manipulation aspect of the game, needed for good
   performance, has not been addressed enough; two important parameters are
   the potting accuracy and advantageous cue ball positioning for next
   shot. In this regard, robotic ball manipulation by predicting the ball
   trajectories under the action of various dynamic phenomena, such as ball
   spin, impacts and friction, is the key consideration of this research.
   By establishing a connection to the methods used in nonprehensile
   robotic manipulation, a forward model is developed for the rolling,
   sliding, and two distinct types of frictional impacts of billiards balls
   are developed. High-speed camera-based tracking is performed to
   determine the physical parameters required for the developed dynamic
   models. To solve the inverse manipulation problem, i.e., the decision on
   shot parameters, for accurate ball positioning, an optimization based
   solution is proposed. A simplistic ball manipulator is designed and used
   to test the theoretical developments. Experimental results show that a
   90\% potting accuracy and a 100-200 mm post-shot cue ball positioning
   accuracy has been achieved by the autonomous system within a table area
   of 6 x 5 ft(2).}},

Abstract = {{The Enhanced ArabChat is a complement of the previous version of
   ArabChat. This paper details an enhancements development of a novel and
   practical Conversational Agent for the Arabic language called the
   ``Enhanced ArabChat{''}. A conversational Agent is a computer program
   that attempts to simulate conversations between machine and human. Some
   of lessons was learned by evaluating the previous work of ArabChat.
   These lessons revealed that two major issues affected the ArabChat's
   performance negatively. Firstly, the need for a technique to distinguish
   between question and non-question utterances to reply with a more
   suitable response depending on the utterance's type (question and
   non-question based utterances). Secondly, the need for a technique to
   handle an utterance targeting many topics that require firing many rules
   at the same time. Therefore, in this paper, the ``Enhanced ArabChat{''}
   will cover these enhancements to improve the ArabChat's performance. A
   real experiment has been done in Applied Science University in Jordan as
   an information point advisor for their native Arabic students to
   evaluate the Enhanced ArabChat.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a decision support system that aims to estimate a
   patient's general condition and detect situations which pose an
   immediate danger to the patient's health or life. The use of this system

   care of many patients in various general conditions. Particular stress
   is laid on cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions, including those
   leading to sudden cardiac arrest. The proposed system is a stand-alone
   microprocessor-based device that works in conjunction with a standard
   vital signs monitor, which provides input signals such as temperature,
   blood pressure, pulseoxymetry, ECG, and ICG. The signals are
   preprocessed and analysed by a set of artificial intelligence
   algorithms, the core of which is based on Bayesian networks. The paper
   focuses on the construction and evaluation of the Bayesian network, both

Abstract = {{Predicting the box-office revenue of a movie before its theatrical
   release is an important but challenging problem that requires a high
   level of Artificial Intelligence. Nowadays, social media has shown its
   predictive power in various domains, which motivates us to exploit
   social media content to predict box-office revenues. In this study, we
   employ both linear and non-linear regression models, which are based on
   the crowd wisdom of social media, especially the posts of users, to
   predict movie box-office revenues. More specifically, the attention and
   popularity of the movie, purchase intention of users, and comments of
   users are automatically mined from social media data. In our model, the
   use of Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression in predicting the
   box-office revenue of a movie before its theatrical release is explored.
   To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a
   cross-validation experiment is conducted. The experimental results show
   that large-scale social media content is correlated with movie
   box-office revenues and that the purchase intention of users can lead to
   more accurate movie box-office revenue predictions. Both the linear and
   non-linear prediction models have the advantage of predicting movie
   grosses in our experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Smart meters have been deployed in many countries across the world since
   early 2000s. The smart meter as a key element for the smart grid is
   expected to provide economic, social, and environmental benefits for
   multiple stakeholders. There has been much debate over the real values
   of smart meters. One of the key factors that will determine the success
   of smart meters is smart meter data analytics, which deals with data
   acquisition, transmission, processing, and interpretation that bring
   benefits to all stakeholders. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
   of smart electricity meters and their utilization focusing on key
   aspects of the metering process, different stakeholder interests, and
   the technologies used to satisfy stakeholder interests. Furthermore, the
   paper highlights challenges as well as opportunities arising due to the
   advent of big data and the increasing popularity of cloud environments.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) is a well-known and efficient process to
   cover and evaluate a large range of states for combinatorial problems.
   We choose to study MCTS for the Computer Go problem, which is one of the
   most challenging problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence. For
   this game, a single combinatorial approach does not always lead to a
   reliable evaluation of the game states. In order to enhance MCTS ability
   to tackle such problems, one can benefit from game specific knowledge in
   order to increase the accuracy of the game state evaluation. Such a
   knowledge is not easy to acquire. It is the result of a constructivist
   learning mechanism based on the experience of the player. That is why we
   explore the idea to endow the MCTS with a process inspired by
   constructivist learning, to self-acquire knowledge from playing
   experience. In this paper, we propose a complementary process for MCTS
   called BHRF (Background History Reply Forest), which allows to memorize
   efficient patterns in order to promote their use through the MCTS
   process. Our experimental results lead to promising results and
   underline how self-acquired data can be useful for MCTS based
   algorithms.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{14-29}},

Abstract = {{In today's volatile markets, increasingly unpredictable customer demand
   is exerting great challenges to responsive replenishment. The complexity
   of responsive replenishment is higher when the business is global in
   which demand in both domestic and overseas markets has to be catered
   for. The emergence of cloud computing has eased the difficulties as it
   allows nearly real-time access to a universal platform for information
   sharing between franchisors and franchisees, creating huge opportunities
   for understanding global market needs for responsive replenishment.
   Considering the existence of uncertainties due to the fluctuating
   demands, fuzzy logic is useful in providing decision support for
   replenishment in uncertain environments. This paper presents a
   cloud-based responsive replenishment system to manage operation data of
   a franchise business using cloud computing, and for analysis using fuzzy
   logic in order to provide franchisors with the required inventory
   levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that
   applies cloud computing and artificial intelligence techniques in
   franchising. A pilot run of the system is conducted in an education
   company, which is considered to be a good representation of an industry
   operating with a franchise model. The results show that the system
   allows franchisors to formulate effective responsive replenishment
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{To cope with the increasing demand for efficient data delivery,
   self-organizing networks have been introduced in the Long Term Evolution
   (LTE) system to provide autonomous and flexible mobility management. The
   existing handover triggering scheme for LTE is not flexible enough to
   incorporate new performance metrics, and it introduces handover latency.
   There are studies on non-conventional handoff algorithms for LTE
   applications, for instance, the fuzzy logic approach. However, the fuzzy
   logic approach needs regular manual tuning to constantly produce optimal
   output. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing an adaptive
   fuzzy logic-based handoff decision algorithm, which can cope with
   environmental changes and improve efficiency by reducing human
   intervention. Performance results show that the proposed algorithm can
   reduce unnecessary handovers by about 20\% compared with the fuzzy logic
   and conventional LTE handover triggering scheme, leading to reduced
   packet loss rates.}},

Abstract = {{Computers and artificial intelligence play a key role in the production
   of artwork through the designing of synthetic agents that are able to
   reproduce the capabilities of human artists in assembling high-quality
   artefacts such as paintings and sculptures. In this context, music
   composition represents one of the art disciplines that can greatly
   benefit from the appropriate use of computational intelligence, as
   witnessed by the large number of research activities performed in this
   field over the recent years. Nevertheless, the automatic composition of
   music is far from being completely and precisely perfected due to the
   intrinsic virtuosity that characterizes human musicians' capabilities.
   This paper reduces this gap with the proposal of an intelligent scheme
   for the efficient composition of melodies based on a musical method that
   is inspired by and strongly characterized by human virtuosity: the
   unfigured bass technique. In particular, we formulate this music
   composition technique as an optimization problem and solve it with an
   adaptive multi-agent memetic approach comprising diverse metaheuristics,
   the composer agents that cooperate to create high-quality four-voice
   pieces of music starting from a bass line as input. A collection of
   experimental studies on the famous Bach's four-voice chorales showed
   that the cooperation among different optimization strategies yields
   improved performance over the solutions obtained by conventional and

Abstract = {{This paper presents the implementation of an intelligent pressure
   transmitter to measure pressure using a bellow sensor. In industrial
   applications, the deflection of the bellow due to applied pressure must
   be translated into an efficient electrical readout for monitoring,
   transmission and control. An inductive pick-up is used to convert the
   deflection of the bellow into the change in self-inductance of a coil.
   The signal conditioning circuit designed for the bellow sensor with the
   inductive coil is an inductance to voltage conversion circuit (ITVCC).
   The stray inductances, component tolerances and ambient factors
   introduce errors in the output of the ITVCC. The voltage-pressure
   relation exhibits a considerable nonlinearity and limits the measurement
   to local operations. In this aspect, we propose an artificial neural
   network (ANN) using a radial basis function to estimate and compensate
   the nonlinearity of the ITVCC. The intelligence of ANN modeling is
   incorporated into an embedded plug-in-module (EPIM). The output voltage
   of the EPIM is converted into a 4-20 mA current signal for further
   processing. The performance of the proposed technique is experimentally
   verified. The nonlinearity expressed as maximum deviation from the
   desired response is within +/- 0.6\% of full scale reading. The design
   aspects, simulation analysis and experimental results of the technique
   are reported. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increasing complexity of software development activities, the
   need for effective effort estimation techniques has arisen.
   Underestimation leads to disruption in the project's estimated cost and
   delivery. On the other hand, overestimation causes outbidding and
   financial losses in business. Effective software effort estimation
   techniques enable project managers to schedule the software life cycle
   activities appropriately. Correctly assessing the effort needed to
   develop a software product is a major concern in software industries.
   Random forest (RF) technique is a popularly used machine learning
   technique that helps in improving the prediction values. The main
   objective of this study is to precisely assess the software projects
   development effort by utilising the use case point approach. The effort
   parameters are optimised utilising the RF technique to acquire higher
   prediction accuracy. Moreover, the results acquired applying the RF
   technique is compared with the multi-layer perceptron, radial basis
   function network, stochastic gradient boosting and log-linear regression
   techniques to highlight the performance attained by each technique.}},

Abstract = {{Object tracking is one of the most challenging problems in computer
   vision. Only Fast trackers can satisfy the real-time requirements and
   can be used in many artificial intelligence applications. Due to the
   impressive high-speed, correlation filters have received much attention
   within the field of object tracking. Recently, trackers using luminance
   information or color names for image description have been performed in
   a correlation filters framework. In this paper, we propose the usage of
   discriminative color descriptors to improve the tracking performance of
   the traditional correlation filters tracker. Discriminative color
   descriptors are compact and efficient. Moreover, our tracker
   incorporates scale estimation into the traditional correlation filters,
   which results in increased tracking performance. Extensive experiments
   demonstrate that the proposed tracker can obtain superior results
   compared to existing trackers using correlation filters and it is also
   able to outperform state-of-the-art trackers on the CVPR2013 object
   tracking benchmark. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wiper blade of automobile is among those types of flexible system that
   is required to be operated in quite high velocity to be efficient in
   high load conditions. This causes some annoying noise and deteriorated
   vision for occupants. The modeling and control of vibration and
   low-frequency noise of an automobile wiper blade using soft computing
   techniques are focused in this study. The flexible vibration and noise
   model of wiper system are estimated using artificial intelligence system
   identification approach. A PD-type fuzzy logic controller and a PI-type
   fuzzy logic controller are combined in cascade with active force control
   (AFC)-based iterative learning (IL). A multiobjective genetic algorithm
   is also used to determine the scaling factors of the inputs and outputs
   of the PID-FLC as well as AFC-based IL gains. The results from the
   proposed controller namely fuzzy force learning (FFL) are compared with
   those of a conventional lead-lag-type controller and the wiper bang-bang
   input. Designing controllers based on classical methods could become
   tedious, especially for systems with high-order model. In contrast, FFL
   controller design requires only tuning of some scaling factors in the
   control loop and hence is much simpler and efficient than classical
   design methods.}},

Abstract = {{The explosive growth in volume, velocity, and diversity of data produced
   by mobile devices and cloud applications has contributed to the
   abundance of data or `big data.' Available solutions for efficient data
   storage and management cannot fulfill the needs of such heterogeneous
   data where the amount of data is continuously increasing. For efficient
   retrieval and management, existing indexing solutions become inefficient
   with the rapidly growing index size and seek time and an optimized index
   scheme is required for big data. Regarding real-world applications, the
   indexing issue with big data in cloud computing is widespread in
   healthcare, enterprises, scientific experiments, and social networks. To
   date, diverse soft computing, machine learning, and other techniques in
   terms of artificial intelligence have been utilized to satisfy the
   indexing requirements, yet in the literature, there is no reported
   state-of-the-art survey investigating the performance and consequences
   of techniques for solving indexing in big data issues as they enter
   cloud computing. The objective of this paper is to investigate and
   examine the existing indexing techniques for big data. Taxonomy of
   indexing techniques is developed to provide insight to enable
   researchers understand and select a technique as a basis to design an
   indexing mechanism with reduced time and space consumption for BD-MCC.
   In this study, 48 indexing techniques have been studied and compared
   based on 60 articles related to the topic. The indexing techniques'
   performance is analyzed based on their characteristics and big data
   indexing requirements. The main contribution of this study is taxonomy
   of categorized indexing techniques based on their method. The categories
   are non-artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence, and
   collaborative artificial intelligence indexing methods. In addition, the
   significance of different procedures and performance is analyzed,
   besides limitations of each technique. In conclusion, several key future
   research topics with potential to accelerate the progress and deployment
   of artificial intelligence-based cooperative indexing in BD-MCC are
   elaborated on.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Optimum design of real world steel space frames under design code
   provisions is a complicated optimization problem due to the presence of
   large numbers of highly nonlinear constraints and discrete design
   variables. The use of gradient based optimization techniques in finding
   the optimum solution of such large design problems is cumbersome due to
   the selection of initial design points and convergence difficulties
   while meta heuristic algorithms do not suffer such problems. Artificial
   bee colony (ABC) algorithm is one of the recent additions to the swarm
   intelligence based meta-heuristic search techniques that mimic natural
   foraging behavior of honey bees. In this study optimum design problem of
   steel space frames is formulated according to the provisions of
   LRFD-AISC and its solution is obtained by using enhanced artificial bee
   colony algorithm. The performance of artificial bee colony algorithm is
   improved by adding Levy flight distribution in the search of scout bees.
   Real world steel space frames are designed with the new algorithm
   developed in this study to demonstrate its robustness and efficiency.

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{This paper brings a contribution focused on collaborative engineering
   projects where knowledge plays a key role in the process. Collaboration
   is the arena, engineering projects are the target, knowledge is the
   currency used to provide harmony into the arena since it can potentially
   support innovation and, hence, a successful collaboration. The building
   and construction domain is challenged with significant problems for
   exchanging, sharing and integrating information between actors. For
   example, semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual
   and technical level, are problems fundamentally created through the
   employment of representations to map the `world' into models in an
   endeavour to anticipate different actors' views, vocabulary, and
   objectives. One of the primary research challenges addressed in this
   work is the process of formalization and representation of document
   content, where most existing approaches are limited in their capability
   and only take into account the explicit, word-based information in the
   document. The research described in this paper explores how traditional
   knowledge representations can be enriched by incorporation of implicit
   information derived from the complex relationships (the Semantic
   Associations) modelled by domain ontologies combined with the
   information presented in documents, thereby providing a baseline for
   facilitating knowledge interpretation and sharing between humans and
   machines. The paper introduces a novel conceptual framework for
   representation of knowledge sources, where each knowledge source is
   semantically represented (within its domain of use) by a Semantic
   Vector. This work contributes to the enrichment of Semantic Vectors,
   using the classical vector space model approach extended with
   ontological support, employing ontology concepts and their relations in
   the enrichment process. The test bed for the assessment of the approach
   is the Building and Construction industry, using an appropriate B\&C
   domain Ontology. Preliminary results were collected using a clustering
   algorithm for document classification, which indicates that the proposed
   approach does improve the precision and recall of classifications.
   Future work and open issues are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{One of the biggest challenges associated with design and digital
   reconstruction of free forms comes from uniqueness and unrepeatability
   of these shapes. During digital reconstruction of these forms, the
   designer has to choose the right set of geometric features and then
   compose them in a way that will enable the most accurate reconstruction
   of the geometry. While doing this, the designer primarily relies on
   personal experience gained through work with free-form objects of
   similar geometry. In our opinion, the analysis of free-form objects
   geometry should rely upon semantic interpretation of their geometric and
   other features, and the greatest challenge of automation of digital
   reconstruction and free-form object design in general is closely related
   to automation of semantic interpretation of geometric and other
   free-form object features. In this paper, a case of chest bone implant
   digital reconstruction is presented, where a new semantic model called
   the active semantic model was used for modeling the meaning of geometric
   elements, that is, the semantic features of a free-form object. The
   active semantic model and its analogy-based reasoning algorithms have
   shown themselves as applicable for the automation of semantic
   interpretation of the unique, unrepeatable, and unpredictable forms of
   chest bone. Moreover, this semantic model showed the potential to help
   automate selecting and composing of geometric features for efficient
   digital reconstruction of the geometry of free forms.}},

Abstract = {{A pairwise dictionary selected learning (PDSL) model is proposed in this

   avoid interpolating the fictitious information to the reconstructed
   image. Optimisation is performed using a bilateral regularisation term

   superior to the existing dictionary learning-based methods. The authors
   also present a quantitative evaluation of super-resolution
   reconstruction using various statistics which demonstrated significant
   average peak signal-to-noise ratio improvements by their model. A
   comparison of the proposed method with five other state-of-the-art
   methods is presented and the authors' method achieves better visual
   effects in edge structures.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to the wide array of research that uses swarm intelligence
   to solve optimization problems, a few approaches have recently been
   taken a feedback control perspective as we do here. To employ a feedback
   control approach, this paper shows that an algorithmic model of how
   honeybees forage can be used for control of smart lights. We show that
   only slight modifications to this model are needed to control multiple
   lights and to provide uniform illumination across the floor of an
   experimental testbed. The most challenging case is when there are no
   walls between lighting zones since then there are a significant
   inter-zone couplings, and the approach here performs especially well
   under these conditions. Performance of this method is compared with a
   variety of testbed conditions where we assume inter-zone coupling as
   overlapping sources. Experimental results supported by parametric
   statistical tests suggest that the method here is better when
   significant overlapping is addressed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We investigate structure of the Primary Language of the human brain as
   introduced by J. von Neumann in 1957. Two components have been
   investigated, the algorithm optimizing warfighting, Linguistic Geometry
   (LG), and the algorithm for inventing new algorithms, the Algorithm of
   Discovery. The latter is based on multiple thought experiments, which
   manifest themselves via mental visual streams ({''}mental movies{''}).
   It appears that those streams are the only interface available for this
   brain phenomenon. The visual streams can run concurrently and can
   exchange information between each other. The streams may initiate
   additional thought experiments, program them, and execute them in due
   course. The visual streams are focused employing the algorithm of ``a
   child playing a construction set{''} that includes a visual model, a
   construction set and the Ghost. It appears that all the discoveries
   require optimization hidden in the algorithm, object or process to be
   discovered. Natural and artificial objects are usually optimized one way
   or another. Thus optimization should be a major component of the
   Algorithm of Discovery. As an algorithm utilized by humans since ancient
   times it could not use any kind of differential calculus for such
   optimization. This paper is the first attempt to reveal the nature of
   this optimization component that is named proximity reasoning. Our
   findings about proximity reasoning are tested on the thought experiments
   for development of two algorithms in LG: function next for the Grammars
   of Shortest Trajectories and the No-Search Approach based on the State
   Space Chart. While those experiments were already investigated in
   several papers this paper takes yet another look at them in order to
   revealing the nature of proximity reasoning.}},

Title = {{Behavioral plasticity through the modulation of switch neurons}},
Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{35-51}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A central question in artificial intelligence is how to design agents
   capable of switching between different behaviors in response to
   environmental changes. Taking inspiration from neuroscience, we address
   this problem by utilizing artificial neural networks (NNs) as agent
   controllers, and mechanisms such as neuromodulation and synaptic gating.
   The novel aspect of this work is the introduction of a type of
   artificial neuron we call ``switch neuron{''}. A switch neuron regulates
   the flow of information in NNs by selectively gating all but one of its
   incoming synaptic connections, effectively allowing only one signal to
   propagate forward. The allowed connection is determined by the switch
   neuron's level of modulatory activation which is affected by modulatory
   signals, such as signals that encode some information about the reward
   received by the agent. An important aspect of the switch neuron is that
   it can be used in appropriate ``switch modules{''} in order to modulate
   other switch neurons. As we show, the introduction of the switch modules
   enables the creation of sequences of gating events. This is achieved
   through the design of a modulatory pathway capable of exploring in a
   principled manner all permutations of the connections arriving on the
   switch neurons. We test the model by presenting appropriate
   architectures in nonstationary binary association problems and T-maze
   tasks. The results show that for all tasks, the switch neuron
   architectures generate optimal adaptive behaviors, providing evidence
   that the switch neuron model could be a valuable tool in simulations
   where behavioral plasticity is required. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   sensor network for high-speed rail}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{83-93}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{With the rapid development of high-speed rail (HSR) systems, the
   security and safety of these huge systems are becoming the primary
   concerns for passengers. HSR infrastructure plays an important role in
   HSR systems, making the maintenance of security and safety of the HSR
   infrastructure especially important. Meanwhile, sensor network
   technologies allow the realization of real-time and all-weather
   monitoring of HSR infrastructure. This paper analyzes the application
   requirements and characteristics of infrastructure health monitoring
   sensor network (IHMSN) through construction of a three-layer IHMSN which
   is composed of end devices, repeater points, and access points. The
   physical topology optimization goal of IHMSN is to set the optimal
   number of network nodes (namely, minimum cost) as well as the best
   physical connections. Given types and amount of the end devices, a
   multiple knapsack model is established which converts the physical
   topology optimization problems into multiple knapsack problems. Based on
   the different needs of practical application, three different cases
   (basis case, adding devices case and weight-based case) are proposed,
   and the corresponding models are built. Some artificial intelligence
   algorithms and a traditional dynamic programming algorithm are presented
   to solve the problems. In addition, a general algorithmic finite state
   machine is proposed to describe the solving process. After comparing
   these algorithms in execution time, memory, and optimal results, the
   genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm stand out
   when used to solve the basic case as well as the extended cases. The
   numerical results show that these proposed models and algorithms can
   effectively solve the physical topology optimization problem of IHMSN
   for HSR systems. Moreover, these methods can effectively reduce network
   costs and provide a theoretical basis for network communication link
   optimization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we will propose a modular structure to control the
   human-like movements of a robot in a way similar to which human brain
   does to perform the motor control. Modeling of human motor control and

   advancements in robots movement Hence, our proposed modular controller
   is based on human brain behavior in using neural mechanisms named
   internal models and primitive motion identification which leads to
   extract and learn the latent simple motions in order to imitate observed
   complex movements. The study is accomplished based on formerly proposed
   structure, MOSAIC, which provides remarkable efficiency in motor control
   modeling. Examination of the proposed structure with real recorded data,

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of autonomous generation of sensory
   systems of autonomous virtual characters. We believe, following the new
   trends of Artificial Intelligence, that the level of coherence required
   for natural behavior of a virtual character in complex worlds can only
   be achieved by a strong connection between its mind and the surrounding
   environment. Therefore, the characters' sensory system plays a
   fundamental role on that relationship. Vision is particularly important
   because it allows the agent to perceive its surroundings without the
   help of any external description. Thus, in order to evolve an artificial
   vision system for a virtual character, we devised a novel technique for
   genetically encoding artificial neural networks. Through our technique,
   we are able to obtain emergent functional controllers by structurally
   coupling the neural network to the environment. Two types of evolution
   were tested: an objective-guided evolution; and an environment-guided
   evolution, for which no descriptions of objectives are provided. (C)

Abstract = {{Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are successfully used for
   various design and optimization tasks, and have previously been applied
   to design magic tricks. A magical effect is an event that the observer
   perceives as being outside the normal physical rules of the world. In
   this work, we revisit an AI framework that has been used to produce a
   two-dimensional interlocking piece jigsaw design with two simultaneous
   solutions, one showing 12 identical shapes, the other only ten, giving
   rise to the believable illusion of the shapes vanishing. To achieve this
   effect, the design framework enables the combination of both geometric
   optimization constraints and constraints derived from empirically
   determined psychophysical and cognitive investigations. We further
   discuss the human factors that affect an observer's perception of a
   magic trick and how these observations can be used in a computational
   optimization process. We also provide a more detailed analysis of the
   algorithms used to generate the magical effects.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial Bee Colony algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of
   real honey bees is one of the most popular swarm intelligence based

   computation approaches, Artificial Bee Colony algorithm is intrinsically
   suitable for distributed architectures. However, determining which food
   source should be chosen to distribute between subcolonies and
   communication topology applied still remain as an important problem for
   parallel implementations. In this study, a new schema for increasing the
   quality of the distributed source by changing best solution is
   presented. The proposed model is adapted to ring migration topology and
   its effectivenes is compared with conventional ring based topology in
   which best food sources in each subpopulation are distributed and the
   original sequential counterpart. Comparative results show that the
   proposed model increased the quality of the solutions and early

Abstract = {{Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods contribute to the construction of
   systems where there is a need to automate the tasks. They are typically
   used for problems that have a large response time, or when a
   mathematical method cannot be used to solve the problem. However, the
   application of AI brings an added complexity to the development of such
   applications. AI has been frequently applied in the power systems field,
   namely in Electricity Markets (EM). In this area, AI applications are
   essentially used to forecast /estimate the prices of electricity or to
   search for the best opportunity to sell the product. This paper proposes
   a clustering methodology that is combined with fuzzy logic in order to
   perform the estimation of EM prices. The proposed method is based on the
   application of a clustering methodology that groups historic energy
   contracts according to their prices' similarity. The optimal number of
   groups is automatically calculated taking into account the preference
   for the balance between the estimation error and the number of groups.
   The centroids of each cluster are used to define a dynamic fuzzy
   variable that approximates the tendency of contracts' history. The
   resulting fuzzy variable allows estimating expected prices for contracts
   instantaneously and approximating missing values in the historic
   contracts.}},

Title = {{Sensor Fault Diagnosis}},
Journal = {{FOUNDATIONS AND TRENDS IN SYSTEMS AND CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{I+}},
Abstract = {{This tutorial investigates the problem of the occurrence of multiple
   faults in the sensors used to monitor and control a network of
   cyber-physical systems. The goal is to formulate a general methodology,
   which will be used for designing sensor fault diagnosis schemes with
   emphasis on the isolation of multiple sensor faults, and for analyzing
   the performance of these schemes with respect to the design parameters
   and system characteristics. The backbone of the proposed methodology is
   the design of several monitoring and aggregation cyber agents (modules)
   with specific properties and tasks. The monitoring agents check the
   healthy operation of sets of sensors and infer the occurrence of faults
   in these sensor sets based on structured robustness and sensitivity
   properties. These properties are obtained by deriving analytical
   redundancy relations of observer-based residuals sensitive to specific
   subsets of sensor faults, and adaptive thresholds that bound the
   residuals under healthy conditions, assuming bounded modeling
   uncertainty and measurement noise. The aggregation agents are employed
   to collect and process the decisions of the agents, while they apply
   diagnostic reasoning to isolate combinations of sensor faults that have
   possibly occurred. The design and performance analysis methodology is
   presented in the context of three different architectures: for
   cyber-physical systems that consist of a set of interconnected systems,
   a distributed architecture and a decentralized architecture, and for
   cyber-physical systems that are treated as monolithic, a centralized
   architecture. For all three architectures, the decomposition of the
   sensor set into subsets of sensors plays a key role in their ability to
   isolate multiple sensor faults. A discussion of the challenges and
   benefits of the three architectures is provided, based on the system
   scale, the type of system nonlinearities, the number of sensors and the
   communication needs. Lastly, this tutorial concludes with a discussion
   of open problems in fault diagnosis.}},

Title = {{Multi-objective optimization of composite two-stage vibration isolation
   system for sensitive equipment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{343-361}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel strategy of
   optimal parameters configuration and placement for sensitive equipment.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this study, clamped thin plate is
   considered as the foundation form, and a novel composite system is
   proposed based on the two-stage isolation system. By means of the theory
   of mechanical four-pole connection, the displacement amplitude
   transmissibility from the thin plate to precision equipment is derived.
   For the purpose of performing optimal design of the composite system, a
   novel multi-objective idea is presented. Multi-objective particle swarm
   optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is adopted as an optimization technique,
   which can achieve a global optimal solution (gbest), and selecting the
   desired solution from an equivalent Pareto set can be avoided. Maximum
   and variance of the four transmitted peak displacements are considered
   as the fitness functions simultaneously; the purpose is aimed at
   reducing the amplitude of the multi-peak isolationsystem, meanwhile
   pursuing a uniform vibration as far as possible. The optimization is
   mainly organized as a combination of parameter configuration and
   placement design, and the traversal search of discrete plate is
   performed in each iteration for the purpose of achieving the global
   optimum.
   Findings - An important transmissibility based on the mechanical
   four-pole connection is derived, and a composite vibration isolation
   system is proposed, and a novel optimization problem is also defined
   here. This study reports a novel optimization strategy combined with
   artificial intelligence for parameters and placement design of precision
   equipment, which can promote the traditional view of two-stage vibration
   isolation.
   Originality/value - Two-stage vibration isolation systems are widely
   applied to the vibration attenuation of precision equipment, but in
   these traditional designs, vibration participation of foundation is
   often ignored. In this paper, participation of foundation of equipment
   is considered, and a coherent new strategy for equipment isolation and
   foundation vibration is presented. This study shows a new vision of
   interdisciplinary including civil engineering, mechanical dynamics and
   computational science.}},

Abstract = {{In order to solve problems of optimization, Swarm Intelligence (SI)
   algorithms are extensively becoming more popular. Many SI based
   optimization techniques are present but most face problems like
   convergence problem and local minimization problem. In this paper, a
   hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed using fractional order
   Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimization
   to solve the existing problems. The proposed algorithm has four phases
   such as, employee bee, onlooker bee, mutation and scout bee. In employee
   bee phase, neighbour solution is generated based on ABC algorithm. Then,
   in onlooker bee, the probability is used to select a solution and new
   solution is generated based on Fractional Calculus (FC) dependent
   neighbour solution. The mutation operation of GA is used in the mutation
   module and then the scout bee phase is carried out. The proposed
   algorithm is implemented in MATLAB. For experimentation, the unimodal
   benchmark functions such as: De jong's, axis parallel hyper-ellipsoid,
   rotated hyper-ellipsoid and multi-modal functions such as: Griewank and
   rastrigin are utilzed to anlayse the performance of the algorithm. Then,
   the comparison of the algorithm is also, carried out with the existing
   ABC, GA and hybrid algorithm. From the results, we can see that the
   proposed technique has obtained better results by acquiring better
   minimization and convergence rate.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to classify critical security issues in cloud
   banking organizations, according to the cloud service models (CSM), and
   the cloud deployment models (CDM). We classified and ranked the critical
   cloud security issues for banking organizations based on secondary and
   primary data. In this regard the cloud Delphi study is modified into
   three phases like identifying, analysis, and evaluating security issues.
   In this study, the samples of 40 panelists were selected from inside and
   outside Malaysian banking organizations based on their experienced in
   the banking environment to set the insight of the cloud issues. The
   study starts with a list of cloud security issues based on secondary
   data and interview. In addition, we illustrated the level of risk for
   all the cloud security issues in banking organizations as small, medium,
   and large risk. We also indicated that the highest risk of Trusted cloud
   in 3rd party (providers) and policies security issues and the highest
   risk of Availability and Mobility in application and program (software)
   security, etc. The study has been conducted on groups of cloud IT
   managers and cloud banking developers. As a future work, we will control
   and mitigate the critical security issues by using artificial
   intelligence techniques (ANN). A successful classification of critical
   cloud security issues will greatly improve the probability of cloud
   banking success rate.}},

Abstract = {{It is one of the effective methods to improve the reliability of the
   distribution system by using looped network power supply. With the
   development of new energy technology, distributed generation has been
   more widely used. But a small power system named micro-grid which is
   assembled by the device such as distributed generation, energy storage
   device and controllable load in a certain operating rules catches the
   attention of people. It can operate in islanded mode with the power grid
   failure, which can greatly improve the reliability of the system.
   Traditional analytical method and Monte Carlo method are difficult to
   evaluate its reliability accurately. In this paper, a new artificial
   intelligence method based on Bayesian networks is used for the system
   reliability analysis and evaluation. The corresponding Bayesian networks
   are established for the reliability test bus 2 which containing looped
   network and the improve reliability test bus 6 which containing
   micro-grids separately. With the help of causal reasoning and diagnostic
   reasoning, the supply influence of different types of DG output
   intermittent, operation mode on loads are detected, the key factors
   which have an impact on important load power supply reliability are
   found out, which is the theoretical foundation for practical engineering
   decision, so as to improve system reliability, identify failures and
   make maintenance scheduling}},

Abstract = {{The optimization of job-shop scheduling is very important because of its
   theoretical and practical significance. In this paper, a computationally
   effective approach of combining bacterial foraging strategy with
   particle swarm optimization for solving the minimum makespan problem of
   job shop scheduling is proposed. In the artificial bacterial foraging
   system, a novel chemotactic model is designed to address the job shop
   scheduling problem and a mechanism of quorum sensing and communication
   are presented to improve the foraging performance. In the particle swarm
   system, a novel concept for the distance and velocity of a particle is
   presented to pave the way for the job shop scheduling problem. The
   proposed coevolutionary algorithm effectively exploits the capabilities
   of distributed and parallel computing of swarm intelligence approaches.
   The algorithm is examined using a set of benchmark instances with
   various sizes and levels of hardness and compared with other approaches
   reported in some existing literatures. The computational results
   validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}},

Journal = {{AUTOMATIKA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{714-723}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a model reference adaptive speed controller based on
   artificial neural network for induction motor drives. The performance of
   traditional feedback controllers has been insufficient in speed control
   of induction motors due to nonlinear structure of the system, changing
   environmental conditions, and disturbance input effects. A successful
   speed control of induction motor requires a nonlinear control system. On
   the other hand, in recent years, it has been demonstrated that
   artificial intelligence based control methods were much more successful
   in the nonlinear system control applications. In this work, it has been
   developed an intelligent controller for induction motor speed control
   with combination of radial basis function type neural network (RBF) and
   model reference adaptive control (MRAC) strategy. RBF is utilized to
   adaptively compensate the unknown nonlinearity in the control system.
   The indirect field-oriented control (IFOC) technique and space vector
   pulse width modulation (SVPWM) methods which are widespread used in high
   performance induction motor drives has been preferred for drive method.
   In order to demonstrate the reliability of the control technique, the
   proposed adaptive controller has been tested under different operating
   conditions and compared performance of conventional PI controller. The
   results show that the proposed controller has got a clear superiority to
   the conventional linear controllers.}},

   method based on adaptive boosting we have proposed aggregatig the
   opinions of a group of people. We have implemented a web application to
   gather opinions of people and used the application to collect data for
   the experimental analysis. The model problem was to identify whether

   most successful individual within the group in many cases. We have
   observed that the highest increase in the collective intelligence may be

   to the left and right as well as eye movement upwards and downwards. The
   integrated of ANN with EEG digital data signals is to train the
   large-scale digital data and thus predict the eye movement behaviour
   with stress activity. Since this study is using large-scale digital
   data, the parallelization of integrated ANN with EEG signals has been
   implemented on Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) supported by
   heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems. The real data set from eye therapy
   industry, IC Herbz Sdn Bhd was carried out in order to validate and
   simulate the eye movement behaviour. Parallel performance analyses can
   be captured based on execution time, speedup, efficiency, and
   computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolic engineering of microorganism is widely used to enhance the
   production of metabolites that is useful in food additives,
   pharmaceutical, supplements, cosmetics, and polymer materials. One of
   the approaches for enhancing the biomass production is to utilize gene
   deletion strategies. Flux Balance Analysis is introduced to delete the
   gene that eventually leads the overproduction of the biomass and then to
   increase the biomass production. However, the result of biomass
   production obtained does not achieve the optimal production. Therefore,
   we proposed a hybrid algorithm of Particle Swarm Optimization and Flux
   Balance Analysis to attain an optimal gene deletion that is able to
   produce a higher biomass production. In this research, Particle Swarm
   Optimization is introduced as an optimization algorithm to obtain
   optimal gene deletions while Flux Balance Analysis is used to evaluate
   the fitness (biomass production or growth rate) of gene deletions. By
   performing an experiment on Escherichia coli, the results indicate that
   the proposed hybrid algorithm of Particle Swarm Optimization and Flux
   Balance Analysis is able to obtain optimal gene deletions that can
   produce the highest ethanol production. A hybrid algorithm is suggested
   due to its ability in seeking a higher ethanol production and growth
   rate than OptReg methods.}},

Abstract = {{The major challenges with big data examination and analysis are volume,
   complex interdependence across content, and heterogeneity. The
   examination and analysis phases are considered essential to a digital
   forensics process. However, traditional techniques for the forensic
   investigation use one or more forensic tools to examine and analyse each
   resource. In addition, when multiple resources are included in one case,
   there is an inability to cross-correlate findings which often leads to
   inefficiencies in processing and identifying evidence. Furthermore, most
   current forensics tools cannot cope with large volumes of data. This
   paper develops a novel framework for digital forensic analysis of
   heterogeneous big data. The framework mainly focuses upon the
   investigations of three core issues: data volume, heterogeneous data and
   the investigators cognitive load in understanding the relationships
   between artefacts. The proposed approach focuses upon the use of
   metadata to solve the data volume problem, semantic web ontologies to
   solve the heterogeneous data sources and artificial intelligence models
   to support the automated identification and correlation of artefacts to
   reduce the burden placed upon the investigator to understand the nature
   and relationship of the artefacts.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT \& FUZZY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{3007-3012}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes an adaptive neuro-fuzzy (ANF) nonsingular terminal
   attractor (NTA) that can control output voltage in an AC power
   conditioner. The NTA experiences the convergence of the system
   trajectory to zero within finite time, and it can avoid singularity
   problems. However, when the estimated value exceeds or falls short of
   the uncertain system boundary, chattering or steady-state error problems
   occur. Therefore, the ANF technique is introduced as a computationally
   rapid and mathematically simple means of reducing the chatter and
   steady-state errors occurring in NTA if the estimated value of the
   uncertain system boundary is not met. The Lyapunov theory proves that
   the proposed AC power conditioner is stable and convergent. Associating
   NTA with the ANF technique provides the AC power conditioner with low
   distortion and fast transience in the presence of various loading.
   Experimental results from a 1 kW prototype confirm the mathematical
   analyses and simulations. Because the proposed AC power conditioner
   offers significant advantages over the classic terminal attractor
   (TA)-controlled AC power conditioner in terms of complexity and ease of
   implementation, this paper represents a useful reference for designers
   of artificial intelligence.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable modeling for the rainfall-runoff processes embedded with high
   complexity and non-linearity can overcome the problems associated with
   managing a watershed. Physically based rainfall-runoff models need many
   realistic physical components and parameters which are sometime missing
   and hard to be estimated. In last decades the artificial intelligence
   (AI) has gained much popularity for calibrating the nonlinear
   relationships of rainfall-runoff processes. The AI models have the
   ability to provide direct relationship of the input to the desired
   output without considering any internal processes. This study presents
   an application of Multilayer Perceptron neural network (MLPNN) for the
   continuous and event based rainfall-runoff modeling to evaluate its
   performance for a tropical catchment of Lui River in Malaysia. Five
   years (1999-2013) daily and hourly rainfall and runoff data was used in
   this study. Rainfall-runoff processes were also simulated with a
   traditionally used statistical modeling technique known as
   autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX). The study
   has found that MLPNN model can be used as reliable rainfall-runoff
   modeling tool in tropical catchments.}},

Abstract = {{Population growth and transformation of agricultural or forest
   landscapes to built-up areas are the common phenomenon in the fast
   developing countries. Such changes have significant impact on hydrologic
   processes in the catchment which in turn may end up with an increase in
   both magnitude and frequency of floods in urban areas. Therefore,
   reliable rainfall-runoff models that are able to estimate discharge of a
   catchment accurately are in need. To date, several physically-based
   models are developed to capture the rainfall-runoff process; however,
   they require significant number of parameters which could be difficult
   to be measured or estimated. Beside these models, the artificial
   intelligence techniques have shown their ability to identify a direct
   mapping between inputs and outputs with less number of physical
   parameters. Adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is one
   of the well-practiced techniques in hydrological time series modeling.
   The aim of this study was to check the capability of ANFIS in
   event-based rainfall runoff modeling for a tropical catchment. A total
   of 70 rainfall-runoff events were extracted from twelve years hourly
   rainfall and runoff data of Semenyih River catchment where 50 of them
   were chosen for training and the remaining 20 for testing. An input
   selection method based on correlation analysis and mutual information
   was developed to identify the proper input combinations of rainfall and
   discharge antecedents. The results obtained by ANFIS model were then
   compared with an autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) as a
   bench mark. Results showed that ANFIS outperforms ARX model and has
   capabilities to be used as a reliable rainfall-runoff modeling tool. (C)

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The firefly algorithm is a recent nature-inspired algorithm that is
   receiving increasing attention from the scientific community during the
   last few years. One of its most promising variants is given by the
   memetic self-adaptive firefly algorithm (MSA-FFA), recently introduced
   to solve combinatorial problems. In this paper we propose a modification
   of the original MSA-FFA for continuous optimisation problems. The most
   important features of our method are: the problem-dependent selection of
   control parameters for self-adaptation, a simple population model
   providing an adequate trade-off between exploration and exploitation,
   and the use of an adaptive-size Luus-Jaakola random local search. This
   new method is applied to solve a very difficult real-world continuous
   optimisation problem arising in geometric modelling and manufacturing.
   The paper also provides the first reliable, standardised benchmark for
   this optimisation problem. This benchmark is used for a comparative
   analysis of our method with respect to some of the most popular
   nature-inspired algorithms. Our results show that the proposed method
   outperforms previous approaches (including the standard firefly
   algorithm) for most of the instances in the benchmark.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{With sustainable development as their overarching goal, Urban Water
   System (UWS) managers need to take into account all social, economic,
   technical and environmental facets related to their decisions. Decision
   support systems (DSS) have been used widely for handling such complexity
   in water treatment, having a high level of popularity as academic
   exercises, although little validation and few full-scale implementations
   reported in practice. The objective of this paper is to review the
   application of artificial intelligence methods (mainly machine learning)
   to UWS and to investigate the integration of these methods into DSS. The
   results of the review suggest that artificial neural networks is the
   most popular method in the water and wastewater sectors followed by
   clustering. Bayesian networks and swarm intelligence/optimization have
   shown a spectacular increase in the water sector in the last 10 years,
   being the latest techniques to be incorporated but overtaking case-based
   reasoning. Whereas artificial intelligence applications to the water
   sector focus on modelling, optimization or data mining for knowledge
   generation, their encapsulation into functional DSS is not fully
   explored. Few academic applications have made it into decision making
   practice. We believe that the reason behind this misuse is not related
   to the methods themselves but rather to the disassociation between the
   fields of water and computer engineering, the limited practical
   experience of academics, and the great complexity inherently present.}},

Abstract = {{Compression index is the slope of the void ratio-effective stres (log)
   curve obtained in the odometer test. It is an important parameter used
   to predict consolidation settlement of fine-grained soils. In this
   study, fuzzy logic and artificial neural Networks methods that rapidly
   evolved and widely used in many disciplines in recent years, have been
   employed to estimate the compression index values of fine-grained soils
   using their index properties. Laboratory data from 285 samples were
   collected from the literature. 200 of this data were used in the
   training phase and 85 data were used in testing phase. Multiple
   regression analysis was conducted to determine the effect of the
   independent variable on the dependent variable of compression index. The
   results suggest that liquid limit, natural water content, plasticity
   index, natural unit weight, void ratio and effective stress variables
   are the significant parameters that affect the compression index. The
   results indicate that compression index can best be estimated by the use
   of fuzzy logic methods. Articial neural networks method is the most
   suitable method model to estimate predicting C-c from index properties.}},

Abstract = {{As we march down the road of automation in robotics and artificial
   intelligence, we will need to automate an increasing amount of ethical
   decision-making in order for our devices to operate independently from
   us. But automating ethical decision-making raises novel questions for
   engineers and designers, who will have to make decisions about how to
   accomplish that task. For example, some ethical decision-making involves
   hard moral cases, which in turn requires user input if we are to respect
   established norms surrounding autonomy and informed consent. The author
   considers this and other ethical considerations that accompany the
   automation of ethical decision-making. He proposes some general ethical
   requirements that should be taken into account in the design room, and
   sketches a design tool that can be integrated into the design process to
   help engineers, designers, ethicists, and policymakers decide how best
   to automate certain forms of ethical decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{(Aim) Pathological brain detection (PBD) systems aim to assist and even
   replace neuroradiologists to make decisions for patients. This review
   offers a comprehensive and quantitative comparison for PBD systems by
   artificial intelligence in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning.
   (Method) We first investigated four categories of brain diseases,
   including neoplastic disease, neurodegenerative disease, cerebrovascular
   disease, and inflammation. Next, we introduced important MRI techniques,
   such as the shimming, water and fat suppression, and three advanced
   imaging modalities (functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and
   magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging). Then, we discussed four image
   preprocessing techniques (image denoising, slice selection, brain
   extraction, spatial normalization, and intensity normalization), seven
   feature representation techniques (shape, moment, wavelet, statistics,
   entropy, gray level co-occurrence matrix, and Fourier transform), and
   two dimension reduction techniques (feature selection and feature
   extraction). Afterwards, we studied classification related methods: six
   learning models (decision tree, extreme learning machine, k-nearest
   neighbors, naive Bayes classifier, support vector machine, feed-forward
   neural network), five kernel functions (linear, homogeneous and
   inhomogeneous polynomial, radial basis function, and sigmoid), and three
   types of optimization methods (evolutionary algorithm, stochastic
   optimization, and swarm intelligence). (Results) We introduced three
   benchmark datasets and used K-fold stratified cross validation to avoid
   overfitting. We presented a detailed quantitative comparison among 44
   state-of-the-art PBD algorithms and discussed their advantages and
   limitations. (Discussions) Artificial intelligence is now making stride
   in the PBD field and enjoys a fair amount of success. In the future,
   semi-supervised learning and transfer learning techniques may be
   potential breakthroughs to develop PBD systems.}},

Abstract = {{Filtering is one of the most important processes in electrical
   engineering. In digital systems, there are several methods that have
   been developed for filter designs. In this study, a new decision making
   system, which can be operated online or offline, based on statistical
   tests are developed for choosing the most appropriate FIR filter
   coefficients. For this purpose, this coefficients are optimized
   comparatively with nine evolutionary algorithms by using combination of
   some of fourteen windowing and four error functions(more than six
   hundred different combinations) as well as can be found via nine
   classical methods. As the evolutionary algorithms use random variables
   to achieve their results, they may not always make same design on each
   run. Therefore, this system is need to make a valid comparison between
   the algorithms employed. The key feature of proposed system is
   artificial intelligence,phase which sorts algorithms from best to worst
   under certain criteria according to chosen error function after using
   Kruskal-Wallis and multiple comparison tests. The proposed new approach
   in this intelligent decision making system, which can be also used for
   special, practical and educational purposes, gives the best results in
   between the algorithms for FIR filter design according to user

Abstract = {{Many problems from the area of AI have been shown tractable for bounded
   treewidth. In order to put such results into practice, quite involved
   dynamic programming (DP) algorithms on tree decompositions have to be
   designed and implemented. These algorithms typically show recurring
   patterns that call for tasks like subset minimization. In this paper we
   present a novel approach to obtain such DP algorithms from simpler
   principles, where the DP formalization of subset minimization is
   performed automatically. We first give a theoretical account of our
   novel method, and then present D-FLAT<\^{}>2, a system that allows one
   to specify the core DP algorithm via answer set programming (ASP). We
   illustrate the approach at work by providing several DP algorithms that
   are more space-efficient than existing solutions, while featuring
   improved readability, reuse and therefore maintainability of ASP code.
   Experiments show that our approach also yields a significant improvement
   in runtime performance.}},

Title = {{Route Selection for Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Networks Using
   Reinforcement Learning: An Experimental Study}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{6304-6324}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) enables unlicensed users to explore and exploit
   underutilized licensed channels (or white spaces). While multi-hop CR
   network has drawn significant research interest in recent years,
   majority work has been validated through simulation. A key challenge in
   multi-hop CR network is to select a route with high quality of service
   (QoS) and lesser number of route breakages. In this paper, we propose
   three route selection schemes to enhance the network performance of CR
   networks, and investigate them using a real testbed environment, which
   consists of universal software radio peripheral and GNU radio units. Two
   schemes are based on reinforcement learning (RL), while a scheme is
   based on spectrum leasing (SL). RL is an artificial intelligence
   technique, whereas SL is a new paradigm that allows communication
   between licensed and unlicensed users in CR networks. We compare the
   route selection schemes with an existing route selection scheme in the
   literature, called highest-channel (HC), in a multi-hop CR network. With
   respect to the QoS parameters (i.e., throughput, packet delivery ratio,
   and the number of route breakages), the experimental results show that
   RL approaches achieve a better performance in comparison with the HC
   approach, and also achieve close to the performance achieved by the SL
   approach.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND SMART ENVIRONMENTS}},

Abstract = {{The vacuum cleaner robot requires the artificial intelligence to solve
   the problem of sweeping of the entire environment areas taking into
   account some factors such as the time and the length of the generated

   environment, we propose the pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) model.
   The latter is based on the firing event in which pulses are emitted from
   a neuron to another until it fires all the neurons. Each neuron has only
   local lateral connections with its neighbors. In addition, this
   mechanism helps the robot to pass through every part of the dynamic
   environment by avoiding obstacles using different sensors. The results
   of simulation and comparison studies demonstrate the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed approach.}},

Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORK WORLD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{253-269}},
Abstract = {{Psychological disorders are generally assessed by screening, behavioral
   features shown by the human. This challenges its accurate differential
   diagnosis and, is also error-prone when there are improper, insufficient
   clinical data and lack of clinical expertise. Thus, neural network based
   assistances in predicting and assessing psychological disorders have
   gained much interest. Childhood autism is a Neuro-psychiatric
   developmental disorder that impairs mainly three functional areas in a
   child: social, communication and behavior. This article demonstrates the
   application of a Possibilistic-Linear Vector Quantization `Po-LVQ'
   neural network for the preliminary screening and grading of childhood
   autistic disorder. The diagnostic system assesses the grades as:
   `Normal', `Mild-Moderate', `Moderate-Severe', `Severe'. It is able to
   perform with an improved overall accuracy of 95\% exactly agreeing to
   the diagnostic criteria. Results of other performance parameters are
   also good enough to support the existing works about the applicability
   of neural network in autism diagnosis. Hence this research proposes a
   Po-LVQ based assessment support system for the diagnostic confirmation
   in grading childhood autism, during uncertain diagnosis due to lack of
   expertise. This helps to reduce the frustration and lengthy delays
   experiencing to parents before obtaining an accurate diagnostic result.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial process monitoring and modeling represent a critical step in

   this paper is to introduce the neo-fuzzy neuron method to be applied in

   assuring a proper accuracy and generalization in the modeled output.
   First, the auxiliary signals in the database are analyzed in order to
   find correlations with the target signal. Second, the neo-fuzzy neuron
   is configured and trained accordingly by means of the auxiliary signal,
   past instants, and dynamics information of the target signal. The
   proposed method is validated by means of real data from a Spanish copper
   rod industrial plant, in which a critical signal regarding copper

   influence of different parameter settings of the chosen rule on the

Title = {{The Forbidden Sentient Computer: Recent Progress in the Electronic
   Monitoring of Consciousness}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{5649-5658}},
Abstract = {{Patients have been known to regain consciousness during surgery while
   still paralyzed by the anesthesia and unable to communicate their
   distress. Recently, electronic engineers have helped resolve this
   problem by improving the real-time monitoring of depth of anesthesia.
   Electronic measurements of the brain's activity are used for many
   clinical and research purposes. This is possible because the brain uses
   electrochemical phenomena in order to process data. Many researchers
   have taken this to mean that advances in computer science will
   eventually result in sentient computers. Some conflate artificial
   consciousness with artificial intelligence even though consciousness and
   intelligence are not positively correlated. Those not trained in
   neurology, or at least medicine, understandably fail to comprehend what
   the rich, complex word ``consciousness'' actually means as a term of
   art. Human consciousness can only be evaluated with surrogate markers
   and is a broad and complex spectrum that ranges from minimally conscious
   to waking consciousness (what the reader is experiencing right now). The
   necessary conditions for waking consciousness include a brain in just
   the right electrical, chemical, and thermal states with sufficient blood
   pressure. These conditions, in turn, require the brain to have a body
   that is maintained in the right environment. Hence, waking consciousness
   is a proper subset of spectrum consciousness and cannot be considered an
   independent phenomenon capable of being disembodied or sliced off of the
   spectrum. The Theory of Mind (TOM) from developmental psychology infers
   that a brain similar to that of humans is a sufficient condition for
   spectrum consciousness. But this theory is precluded for computers
   because a child would not recognize a computer as being a living
   organism that is just like the child. Although TOM could be applied to
   an ideal android, there is a classic mathematical theorem from systems
   science that makes such an android seem infeasible.}},

Title = {{Design of a novel bionic prosthetic knee joint}},
Journal = {{ASSEMBLY AUTOMATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{398-404}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to find a new method that could be applied to
   the high and mid-grade prosthesis knee joint.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on analysis, calculation, modeling,
   simulation and experimental study of the motion law of knee joint, this
   paper not only determines the structure and parameters of the knee joint
   and calculates the instantaneous center but also analyzes the stance
   stability and completes the optimization. With the help of experimental
   tests (fatigue test and gait curve test), the quality and performance of
   the designed knee joint is verified.
   Findings - The experimental results show that the gait curve of the
   designed knee joint is much closer to health people. The designed
   prosthesis knee joint, with adjustable swing speed and gait curve which
   are close to health limb, has a better performance when compared to the
   ordinary knee joint with four-bar linkage structure.
   Originality/value - This paper developed a prosthesis knee joint based

Abstract = {{This paper brings together the disciplines of media and creative
   technologies studies and software systems engineering; it focuses on the
   challenge of finding methodologies to measure, test and decode meaning
   in digital cultural objects. Just as rough set theory is a mathematical
   tool to deal with vagueness and uncertainty in artificial intelligence,
   and approximation accuracy and knowledge granularity are approaches to
   uncertainty research, the authors argue that decoupage analytique is a
   possible method for decoding screen-based information. They draw on a
   variety of examples: interactive online digital art projects; an
   interactive, immersive screen-based art installation; remediated digital
   art installation; expanded cinema; a videogame; and a medical interface
   example, in order to determine if it is possible to map interpretive
   strategies that include a blending of old and new criteria, but
   ultimately promoting an equal partnership between artist and audience,
   and thus, a community of co-creators. Additionally, the authors present
   experimental evidence on the difference introduced by the screen size to
   further qualify the effectiveness of decoupage analytique in relation to
   the amount of screen real estate afforded.}},

Abstract = {{Several web-based educational systems have been designed and widely used

   new mechanism for similarity and indexing based on ontology is proposed
   and elaborated. This paper also compares the performance evaluation of
   indexing system in the vector space model (VSM) and ontology-based

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Clustering is a family of classification techniques, often preceding
   further analysis or application in a number of fields like data
   analysis, strategy selection, supplier selection, etc. Data based neural
   techniques are gaining popularity in clustering applications due to
   flexibility and adaptability. Kohonen's Self Organizing Map (SOM) is
   often used when the objects to be clustered have many attributes. In
   both supervised and un-supervised modes, Kohonen's map exhibit good
   capability to extract a classification which assigns highest weight to
   the most important attribute. In this paper, we have applied SOM for
   classification of firms based on their sources of information for new
   suppliers/customers. Additional data regarding the outsourcing success
   of the firms' is added to see if there is an association between a
   particular set of information sources and the probability of firms'
   success to outsource to partner firms. Using data from World Bank BEEPS
   survey of German industries, we could produce three distinct clusters of
   industries. When successful outsourcing data were included, it still
   showed three clusters. The hits were obtained using specific support
   vector for identification of clusters. We found evidence of associations
   between relational sources and firms' ability to outsource successfully.}},

Title = {{An efficient and scalable Arabic semantic search engine based on a
   domain specific ontology and question answering}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{242-262}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present an efficient and
   scalable Arabic semantic search engine based on a domain-specific
   ontological graph for Colleges of Applied Science, Sultanate of Oman (
   CASOnto). It also supports the factorial question answering and uses two
   types of searching: the keyword-based search and the semantics-based
   search in both languages Arabic and English. This engine is built on
   variety of technologies such as resource description framework data and
   ontological graph. Furthermore, two experimental results are conducted;
   the first is a comparison among entity-search and the classical-search
   in the system itself. The second compares the CASOnto with well-known
   semantic search engines such as Kngine, Wolfram Alpha and Google to
   measure their performance and efficiency.
   Design/methodology/approach - The design and implementation of the
   system comprises the following phases, namely, designing inference,
   storing, indexing, searching, query processing and the user's friendly
   interface, where it is designed based on a specific domain of the IBRI
   CAS ( College of Applied Science) to highlight the academic and
   nonacademic departments. Furthermore, it is ontological inferred data
   stored in the tuple data base ( TDB) and MySQL to handle the
   keyword-based search as well as entity-based search. The indexing and
   searching processes are built based on the Lucene for the keyword
   search, while TDB is used for the entity search. Query processing is a
   very important component in the search engines that helps to improve the
   user's search results and make the system efficient and scalable.
   CASOnto handles the Arabic issues such as spelling correction, query
   completion, stop words' removal and diacritics removal. It also supports
   the analysis of the factorial question answering.
   Findings - In this paper, an efficient and scalable Arabic semantic
   search engine is proposed. The results show that the semantic search
   that built on the SPARQL is better than the classical search in both
   simple and complex queries. Clearly, the accuracy of semantic search
   equals to 100 per cent in both types of queries. On the other hand, the
   comparison of CASOnto with the Wolfram Alpha, Kngine and Google refers
   to better results by CASOnto. Consequently, it seems that our proposed
   engine retrieved better and efficient results than other engines. Thus,
   it is built according to the ontological domain-specific, highly
   scalable performance and handles the complex queries well by
   understanding the context behind the query.
   Research limitations/implications - The proposed engine is built on a
   specific domain ( CAS Ibri-Oman), and in the future vision, it will
   highlight the nonfactorial question answering and expand the domain of
   CASOnto to involve more integrated different domains.
   Originality/value - The main contribution of this paper is to build an
   efficient and scalable Arabic semantic search engine. Because of the
   widespread use of search engines, a new dimension of challenge is
   created to keep up with the evolution of the semantic Web. Whereas,
   catering to the needs of users has become a matter of paramount
   importance in the light of artificial intelligence and technological
   development to access the accurate and the efficient information in less
   possible time. However, the research challenges still in its infancy due
   to lack of research engine that supports the Arabic language. It could
   be traced back to the complexity of the Arabic language morphological
   and grammar rules.}},

Abstract = {{Games became popular, within the formal verification community, after
   their application to automatic synthesis of circuits from

   a very complex single-player strategy game. We show how its solution can
   be encoded and represented as a Bounded Model Checking problem, and then
   solved with a SAT solver. After that, to cope with very complex
   instances of the game, we propose two different ad-hoc
   divide-and-conquer strategies. Those strategies, somehow similar to
   state-of-the-art abstraction-and-refinement schemes, are able to
   decompose deep Bounded Model Checking instances into easier subtasks,
   trading-off between efficiency and completeness. We analyze a vast set
   of difficult hard-to-solve benchmark games, trying to push forward the
   applicability of state-of-the-art SAT solvers in the field. Those
   results show that games may provide one of the next frontier for the SAT

Abstract = {{The application of intelligent systems in industrial environments is
   still restricted, although autonomous systems based on artificial
   intelligence (AI) techniques have been under development for over
   50years and spreading into several areas since the last decade. Such
   integration goes against cultural and technical factors found on the
   shop floor and its project is often challenging. Classical industrial
   systems make use of programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which
   centralise control by using a simple and low-level language. Automated
   planning solutions use a formal language called planning domain
   definition language (PDDL) to address specific problems, with predefined
   initial and target scenarios. Such feature seems to be interesting in
   some cases, since the generic domain models cannot predict all possible
   scenarios in a domain. Therefore, the applicability of intelligent
   systems in industrial cases is directly linked to the development of
   applications that allow integrating different languages, thus ensuring
   the access to PLCs and analysing specific situations. The current paper
   presents an application that integrates automated planning solution and
   PLCs as well as analyses such integrations' functionality. Preliminary
   results are shown by using object process control (OPC) and TCP/IP
   client/server approaches. A comparison with classical approaches was
   presented for a specific case study.}},

   neural network based on backpropagation learning algorithm and a fuzzy
   inference system based on Mamdani model were developed to evaluate the
   risk level of credit applicants. A comparative analysis of the
   performances of both systems was carried out and experimental results
   show that neural network with an overall prediction accuracy of 96.89\%

Abstract = {{Electricity consumption forecast is perceived to be a growing hot topic
   in such a situation that China's economy has entered a period of new

   exploring Chinese electricity consumption influence mechanism and
   forecasting electricity consumption are crucial to formulate electrical

   for exploring the influencing mechanism of various factors on Chinese
   electricity consumption and forecasting electricity consumption in the
   future. The results indicated that the improved ABC algorithm in view of
   the various factors is superior to traditional models just considering
   unilateralism in accuracy and persuasion. The overall findings cast
   light on this model which provides a new scientific and effective way to
   forecast the medium and long term electricity consumption.}},

Title = {{The Robot Path Planning Based on Improved Artificial Fish Swarm
   Algorithm}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Path planning is critical to the efficiency and fidelity of robot
   navigation. The solution of robot path planning is to seek a
   collision-free and the shortest path from the start node to target node.
   In this paper, we propose a new improved artificial fish swarm algorithm
   (IAFSA) to process the mobile robot path planning problem in a real
   environment. In IAFSA, an attenuation function is introduced to improve
   the visual of standard AFSA and get the balance of global search and
   local search; also, an adaptive operator is introduced to enhance the
   adaptive ability of step. Besides, a concept of inertia weight factor is
   proposed in IAFSA inspired by PSO intelligence algorithm to improve the
   convergence rate and accuracy of IAFSA. Five unconstrained optimization
   test functions are given to illustrate the strong searching ability and
   ideal convergence of IAFSA. Finally, the ROS (robot operation system)
   based experiment is carried out on a Pioneer 3-DX mobile robot; the
   experiment results also show the superiority of IAFSA.}},

Journal = {{QUALITY TECHNOLOGY AND QUANTITATIVE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{309-332}},
Abstract = {{Numbers are not data and data analysis does not necessarily produce
   information and knowledge. Statistics, data mining, and artificial
   intelligence are disciplines focused on extracting knowledge from data.
   They provide tools for testing hypotheses, predicting new observations,
   quantifying population effects, and efficiently summarizing data. In
   these fields, quantitative and qualitative data is used to derive
   knowledge. The concept of Information Quality (InfoQ) is defined by
   Kenett and Shmueli as the potential of a dataset to achieve a specific
   (scientific or practical) goal using a given data analysis method. Eight
   dimensions help assess the level of InfoQ of a study. These are: Data
   Resolution, Data Structure, Data Integration, Temporal Relevance,
   Generalizability, Chronology of Data and Goal, Operationalization, and
   Communication. This paper shows with examples, how combining graphical
   analysis with Bayesian analysis in the form of Bayesian networks
   generates high InfoQ. Specifically, we refer to examples from customer
   surveys of high tech companies, risk management of telecom systems,
   monitoring of bioreactors and managing healthcare of diabetic patients.
   These examples support the more general claim made here that Bayesian
   networks generate high information quality (InfoQ).}},

   Logic and Taguchi Method}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{3034-3045}},
Abstract = {{Fuzzy logic Taguchi method (FLTM) is used to optimize parameters for
   wire bonding process. The proposed FLTM integrates orthogonal arrays,
   signal-to-noise ratios, response tables, analysis of variance (ANOVA),
   fuzzy logic, and multiple performance characteristics index. The main
   process parameters for wire bonding are ultrasonication time,
   ultrasonication power, bond force, bond force time, and search force.
   The output responses include ball shear and ball size. The orthogonal
   arrays, signal-to-noise ratios, and response tables reduce the number of
   experiments needed to find the best factor-level combinations. The
   significant control factors are determined by ANOVA. In engineering
   practice, ball size increases as ball shear increases, but an
   excessively large ball size causes a short circuit, whereas an
   excessively small ball size cannot provide enough ball shear. Due to the
   two contradictory output responses, the FLTM is used to find the best
   process parameters. The experimental results show that the process
   parameters obtained by the FLTM result in a smaller ball size and a
   larger ball shear compared with those obtained by statistical methods,
   artificial intelligence techniques, and previous designs.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{2498-2506}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an evolutionary algorithm inspired by biological
   deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) computing is proposed to perform the task of
   optimization. As a novel branch of computational intelligence, DNA
   computing has the strong computing and proliferating capability to in
   DNA strands by DNA encoding and matching in the molecule layer. However,
   it is difficult to apply DNA computing to search processing in a
   nonlinear hyperspace, because traditional DNA computing often relies on
   biochemical reactions of DNA molecules and may result in incorrect or
   undesirable computations. To utilize the advantages and avoid the
   problems of biological DNA computing, this article proposes an
   artificial DNA computing approach, which accelerates the process by
   means of the operation of restriction enzymes based on constructed
   schemata. After DNA encoding, the typical DNA database is constructed
   and evolved by evolutionary algorithms and the schema theory of genetic
   algorithm (GA) integrated to enhance the accuracy and convergence rate
   of exploration in the search space. Meanwhile, to fully utilize
   parallelism characteristics of DNA computing, a novel algorithm, named
   parallel DNA computing algorithm, which is tailored to be implemented in
   graphics processing unit devices, is proposed and exanimated its
   performance on benchmark optimization problems. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed method presents excellent expected
   processing time efficiency, compared with its counterparts without the
   designed accelerating processes, such as schemata, restriction enzyme,
   and migration. As well, the performance is also distinctly superior to
   two renowned GAs.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional thermal relays generally suffer from inaccurate induction

   systems have led to the scope of radically different diagnosis
   strategies based on artificial intelligence techniques. This study use
   fuzzy logic as a software tool and relay logic for external faults

   clustering based Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system is utilized to
   classify five external faults and the normal condition of a low-voltage
   three-phase induction motor using simulation and practical data sets.
   Five external faults- overload, over-voltage, under-voltage,
   single-phasing, and voltage unbalance-along with normal conditions are
   simulated on an induction motor over a wide range of operating voltage
   and load torque; sampled three-phase RMS voltages and currents are used
   as input feature vectors to train the fuzzy inference system. Average
   total classification accuracy and average root means square error
   obtained with ten-times random sub-sampling cross-validation of test
   data sets are used to find the best accurate and generalized fuzzy
   inference system configuration among different cluster radius fuzzy
   inference systems for both simulation and real-time data sets. This
   method accurately detects external faults with 94.37\% average total

Title = {{Manufacturing operations outsourcing through an artificial team process

Abstract = {{The successful applications of artificial intelligence techniques have
   been widely increased during recent years. Today, outsourcing is a
   common strategy to enhance competitive advantages particularly for
   manufacturing industries. When a manufacturer receives a number of
   orders from customers, an internal capacity shortage is inevitable, and
   then the manufacturer may decide to outsource a certain set of orders.
   To get the joint decision on order scheduling and operation outsourcing
   in a parallel machine shop, an intelligent decision making technique
   which is based on an artificial team process algorithm (TPA) is designed
   in current paper. TPA is a recently evolutionary tool where operations
   of exploration and an epitome-based learning behavior is employed, and
   the operation division between elite and plain groups is elaborated. For
   a successful global search, the TPA lets one group (elite) explore more
   global spaces, while, for fast convergence, another group (plain) is
   assigned to local search. So, TPA is an efficient computational-based
   algorithm with the potential of global search during reasonable
   computational efforts. Additionally, a neighborhood search algorithm
   (NSA) with three kinds of neighborhood structures is devised to further
   enhance the quality of solutions at each iteration of TPA. Furthermore,
   the List Scheduling (LS), as a conventional scheduler, a GA and a SA are
   also customized for the addressed problem as benchmark algorithms. The
   comparisons are carried out and the results reveal the superiority of
   suggested method.}},

Abstract = {{Privacy, surveillance, and government abuse of data are concerns of many
   people in our complex digital world. `Big Brother' in the title of this
   article is a metaphorical warning about the consequences if government
   uses modern technologies to maintain power and control people. Issues
   related to the abuse of data and surveillance are not new in the
   academic literature and mass market media, the current threat is however
   greater. Technology has advanced to the point where George Orwell's
   dystopian `Big Brother' vision of a totalitarian state is possible.
   Because of technology advances, barriers associated with collecting and
   processing real-time data about many millions of individuals have been
   removed. This article explores how the capture and use of new data
   streams, and processing with AI and predictive analytics can support
   government control of its citizens. Some components of a system for
   thought control and real-time surveillance are already in use. These
   components like cameras, sensors, No SQL databases, predictive
   analytics, and artificial intelligence can be connected and improved.
   Decision support researchers must understand the issues and resist
   attempts to use information technologies to support current or future
   totalitarian governments.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation about Hall effect sensors' efficiency is confirmed in
   permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive systems. A fuzzy control
   algorithm is used as an artificial intelligence controller. Large scale
   and low slopes are used for creating membership functions and a
   sensitive controller is obtained. Speed is wanted to be taken under
   control and a minimum error value is aimed. PMSM drive systems are
   established using MATLAB-Simulink/SimPower. Simulations are realized
   with real-time parameters in discrete mode. A fuzzy logic controller is
   designed by using the MATLAB/Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. A normalization
   technique and high resolution output of the fuzzy logic controller (FLC)
   are unique aspects of the work. Input variable bandwidths are narrowed
   and the number of membership functions is reduced. The taken steps
   provide positive effects against variation of input parameters. Finally,
   sharp impacts are not produced by the fuzzy controller. Results verified
   that the Hall effect supported controller system gives better results
   than sensorless one. This is especially observed at change points of
   reference speed. Low complitude oscillations and short settling time are
   achieved on speed and torque signals.}},

Title = {{Meta-learning within Projective Simulation}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{2110-2122}},
Abstract = {{Learning models of artificial intelligence can nowadays perform very
   well on a large variety of tasks. However, in practice, different task
   environments are best handled by different learning models, rather than
   a single universal approach. Most non-trivial models thus require the
   adjustment of several to many learning parameters, which is often done
   on a case-by-case basis by an external party. Meta-learning refers to
   the ability of an agent to autonomously and dynamically adjust its own
   learning parameters or meta-parameters. In this paper, we show how
   projective simulation, a recently developed model of artificial
   intelligence, can naturally be extended to account for meta-learning in
   reinforcement learning settings. The projective simulation approach is
   based on a random walk process over a network of clips. The suggested
   meta-learning scheme builds upon the same design and employs clip
   networks to monitor the agent's performance and to adjust its
   meta-parameters on the fly. We distinguish between reflex-type
   adaptation and adaptation through learning, and show the utility of both
   approaches. In addition, a trade-off between flexibility and
   learning-time is addressed. The extended model is examined on three
   different kinds of reinforcement learning tasks, in which the agent has
   different optimal values of the meta-parameters, and is shown to perform
   well, reaching near-optimal to optimal success rates in all of them,
   without ever needing to manually adjust any meta-parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Wavelength converters placement (WCP) in all-optical WDM networks
   belongs to the class of hard combinatorial optimization problems. So
   far, this problem has been solved by various heuristic strategies or by
   application of metaheuristic approaches such as genetic algorithms (GA),
   particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), etc. In
   this paper, we introduce the application of Bee Colony Optimization
   (BCO) metaheuristic to solve the WCP problem in all-optical WDM
   networks. Numerous studies prove that BCO is a fast, robust and
   computationally efficient tool in tackling complex optimization
   problems. The objective of the proposed BCO-WCP algorithm is to find the
   best placement of limited number of wavelength converters in given
   optical network such that the overall network blocking probability is
   minimized. To evaluate the performances of the BCO-WCP algorithm,
   numerous simulation experiments have been performed over some realistic
   optical network examples. The blocking probability performance and
   computational complexity are compared with optimal solution obtained by
   exhaustive search (ES) approach as well as with DE and PSO
   metaheuristics. It will be shown that the BCO-WCP algorithm is not only
   be able to produce high quality (optimal) solution, but significantly
   outperforms the computational efficiency of other considered approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of Nash equilibrium (NE) in real-world settings is often
   impractical due to its too restrictive assumptions. Game theory and
   artificial intelligence provide alternative (relaxed) solution concepts.
   When knowledge about opponents' utilities and types are not available,
   the appropriate solution concept for extensive-form games is the
   self-confirming equilibrium (SCE), which relaxes NE allowing agents to
   have wrong beliefs off the equilibrium path. In this paper, we provide
   the first computational and learning study of the situations in which a
   two-agent extensive-form game is played by heterogeneous populations of
   individuals that repeatedly match (e.g., eBay): we extend the SCE
   concept, we study the equilibrium computation problem, and we study how
   these equilibria affect learning dynamics. We show that SCEs are crucial
   for characterizing both stable states of learning dynamics and the
   dynamics themselves.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of artificial intelligence and pattern recognition fields
   owes greatly the online writer identification challenge. In this work, a
   new method is proposed to the widely neglected problem of
   text-independent online writer identification from Arabic handwriting.
   This method is based on Beta-elliptic model in order to explore the
   utility of this model to discriminate multiples writing styles. In fact,
   Beta-elliptic model provides a rich output in terms of graphical,
   kinematical and biometrical data. The information provided by the
   feature extraction with Beta-elliptic model has been evaluated using
   Feed Forward Neural Network classifier. Experiments are conducted on
   ADAB Database involving respectively 19 and 60 writers show that the
   proposed online Arabic writer identification based on Beta-elliptic

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is achieving a leader-follower
   formation of unmanned aerial vehicles which is a cooperative scenario

   challenges in the formation flying problem which is the base of
   formation flying in living organisms.
   Design/methodology/approach - To achieve the mentioned purposes, a
   feedback linearization technique is used. Moreover, a
   Takagi-Sugeno-based supervisory control strategy for visibility
   maintenance combined with an acceleration estimator to compensate the
   leader maneuvers is proposed.
   Findings - The authors conclude that by using practical seeker sensors,
   all the mentioned objectives (under the proposed strategy) can be

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study is to develop an intelligent
   methodology to find out an optimal feasible assembly sequence while
   considering the assembly predicates.
   Design/methodology/approach - This proposed study is carried out by
   using two artificial immune system-based models, namely, Bone Marrow
   Model and Negative Selection Algorithms, to achieve the following
   objectives: to obtain the possible number of assembly sequences; to
   obtain the feasible assembly sequences while considering different
   assembly predicates; and to obtain an optimal feasible assembly

Abstract = {{The intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) introduced by Atanassov are widely
   applied in all areas such as data analysis, artificial intelligence,

   trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TraIFNs) are able to model
   incomplete and imprecise information based on qualitative in nature.
   Many researchers have proposed different ranking methods on TraIFNs, but
   none of them has covered the entire class of TraIFNs and also almost all
   the methods have disadvantage that they ranked two different IFNs as the
   same at some point of time. In this paper, a complete ranking on the
   class of TraIFNs using axiomatic set of total ordering on some special
   subclasses of TraIFN based on different score functions and an algorithm
   for making decisions from information system with incomplete trapezoidal
   information using proposed ordering, have been studied and also the
   significance of our proposed method over existing methods is shown by
   comparing the proposed method with existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This paper addresses the problem of decision-making in
   relation to the administration of noninvasive mechanical ventilation
   (NIMV) in intensive care units.
   Methods: Data mining methods were employed to find out the factors
   influencing the success/failure of NIMV and to predict its results in
   future patients. These artificial intelligence-based methods have not
   been applied in this field in spite of the good results obtained in
   other medical areas.
   Results: Feature selection methods provided the most influential
   variables in the success/failure of NIMV, such as NIMV hours, PaCO2 at
   the start, PaO2/FiO(2) ratio at the start, hematocrit at the start or
   PaO2/FiO(2) ratio after two hours. These methods were also used in the
   preprocessing step with the aim of improving the results of the
   classifiers. The algorithms provided the best results when the dataset
   used as input was the one containing the attributes selected with the
   CFS method.
   Conclusions: Data mining methods can be successfully applied to
   determine the most influential factors in the success/failure of NIMV
   and also to predict NIMV results in future patients. The results
   provided by classifiers can be improved by preprocessing the data with
   feature selection techniques.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Most approaches to model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) use an
   iterative algorithm to determine the optimum mask. Each iteration
   requires at least one simulation, which is the most time-consuming part
   of model-based OPC. As the layout becomes more complicated and the
   process conditions are driven to the physical limit, the required number
   of iterations increases dramatically. To overcome this problem, we
   propose a method to predict the OPC bias of layout segments with a
   single-hidden-layer neural network. The segments are characterized by
   length and based on intensities at the corresponding control points, and
   these features are used as input to the network, which is trained with
   an extreme learning machine. We obtain a best-error root mean square of
   1.29 nm from training and test experiments for layout clips sampled from
   a random contact layer of a logic device. In addition, we reduced the
   iterations by 27.0\% by initializing the biases in the trained network
   before performing the main iterations of the OPC algorithm. (C) 2016

Journal = {{AI COMMUNICATIONS}},

Pages = {{435-467}},
Abstract = {{One of the claims of Automated Planning is the advantage of representing
   planning tasks in a high-level language where there is a correspondence
   between the real environment and the problem being modelled. However,
   under certain circumstances some representations can be inefficient
   because they contain objects with irrelevant identities. Instead of
   forcing the designer to envision efficient alternatives, we propose an
   automatic compilation that recognises such problems and translates them
   into an alternative representation. In this representation, objects with
   irrelevant names are aggregated and their properties are encoded as
   counters. This class of problems is of special interest in environments
   where objects are created by domain actions and the names assigned to
   these new objects are not relevant for solving the task. The
   experimental results show that our compilation can reduce the size of
   the instantiation and the branching factor, resulting in an important
   improvement of the scalability of planners.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a recently introduced
   optimization method in the research field of swarm intelligence. This
   paper presents an improved ABC algorithm named as OGABC based on
   opposition-based learning (OBL) and global best search equation to
   overcome the shortcomings of the slow convergence rate and sinking into
   local optima in the process of inversion of atmospheric duct. Taking the
   inversion of the surface duct using refractivity from clutter (RFC)
   technique as an example to validate the performance of the proposed
   OGABC, the inversion results are compared with those of the modified
   invasive weed optimization (MIWO) and ABC. The radar sea clutter power
   calculated by parabolic equation method using the simulated and measured
   refractivity profile is utilized to carry out the inversion of the
   surface duct, respectively. The comparative investigation results
   indicate that the performance of OGABC is superior to that of MIWO and
   ABC in terms of stability, accuracy, and convergence rate during the

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{168-183}},
Abstract = {{Environmental and demographic pressures have led to the current
   importance of Water Demand Management (WDM), where the concepts of
   efficiency and sustainability now play a key role. Water must be
   conveyed to where it is needed, in the right quantity, at the required
   pressure, and at the right time using the fewest resources. This paper
   shows how modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can be applied
   on this issue from a holistic perspective. More specifically, the
   multi-agent methodology has been used in order to design an Intelligent
   Decision Support System (IDSS) for real-time WDM. It determines the
   optimal pumping quantity from the storage reservoirs to the
   points-of-consumption in an hourly basis. This application integrates
   advanced forecasting techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks
   (ANNs), and other components within the overall aim of minimizing WDM
   costs. In the tests we have performed, the system achieves a large
   reduction in these costs. Moreover, the multi-agent environment has
   demonstrated to propose an appropriate framework to tackle this issue.}},

Title = {{Intelligent choice-based network revenue management}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIA IRANICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{747-756}},
Abstract = {{Choice-based network revenue management concentrates on importing choice
   models within the traditional revenue management system. Multinomial
   logit is a popular and well-known model which is the basic choice model
   in revenue management. Empirical results indicate inadequacy of this
   model for predicting itinerary shares; therefore, more realistic models,
   such as nested logit, can be proposed for substituting it. Incorporating
   complex choice models in the optimization module based on statistical
   tests without considering the complexity of the obtained mathematical
   model would lead to increase in the complexity of a system without
   obtaining significant improvement. Considering the influence of discrete
   choice model on the structure of optimization model, it is necessary to
   analyze the interaction between specific discrete choice and
   optimization models. In this paper, a knowledge acquisition subsystem is
   introduced for providing intelligence and considering the most suitable
   choice models. We develop the feedforward multilayer perceptron
   artificial neural network for forecasting revenue improvement percent
   obtained by using more realistic choice models. The obtained results
   demonstrate that the new system will decrease the complexity of the
   system, simultaneously, while preserving revenue of the firm. According
   to the computational results, by increasing the resource restriction,
   the process of incorporating more realistic choice model will be more
   important. (C) 2016 Sharif University of Technology. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new metaheuristic algorithm based on the
   artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm for multiobjective optimization

   to the principal framework of multiobjective optimization such as
   Pareto-dominance and crowding distance. A fixed-sized external archive
   to store the nondominated solutions and an improvement procedure to
   promote the convergence to true Pareto front are used. The presented
   approach, IBMO, is compared with four representatives of the
   state-of-the-art algorithms: NSGA2, SPEA2, OMOPSO, and AbYSS. IBMO and
   the selected algorithms from specialized literature are applied to
   several multiobjective benchmark functions by considering the number of
   function evaluations. Then four quality indicators are employed for
   performance evaluations: general distance, spread, maximum spread, and
   hypervolume. The results show that the IBMO is superior to the other

Abstract = {{Microstrip antennas (MAs) have been widely used in the wireless
   communication systems since they have some superiorities over other
   microwave antennas. Compact microstrip antennas (CMAs) are obtained by
   modifying the conductor parts of MAs. CMAs have some advantages over the
   conventional MAs such as smaller size for the same resonant frequency.
   The models of artificial neural network (ANN) and/or adaptive
   neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been used for computing the
   resonant frequency of rectangular ring shaped CMA (RRCMA), C shaped CMA
   (CCMA), E shaped CMA (ECMA), H shaped CMA (HCMA) and L shaped CMA (LCMA)
   in the literature. In this survey study, the results obtained by the ANN
   and ANFIS models used for the resonant frequency computation of these
   slot loaded CMAs were compared with those of the other methods in the
   literature and it is seen that these methods are more successful.
   According to these results, it is seen that ANN and ANFIS networks which
   are the artificial intelligence techniques can be successfully used for
   computing the resonant frequency of slot loaded CMA. Moreover, when the
   ANN and ANFIS studies were investigated, it appears that they are faster
   and more effective than the other methods.}},

Abstract = {{The blast furnace (BF) is the heart of the integrated iron and steel
   industry and used to produce melted iron as raw material for steel. The
   BF has very complicated process to be modeled as it depends on
   multivariable process inputs and disturbances. It is very important to
   minimize operational costs and reduce material and fuel consumption in
   order to optimize overall furnace efficiency and stability, and also to
   improve the lifetime of the furnace within this task. Therefore, if the
   actual flame temperature value is predicted and controlled properly,
   then the operators can maintain fuel distribution such as oxygen
   enrichment, blast moisture, cold blast temperature, cold blast flow,
   coke to ore ratio, and pulverized coal injection parameters in advance
   considering the thermal state changes accordingly. In this paper,
   artificial neural network (ANN), multiple linear regression (MLR), and
   autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models are employed to
   forecast and track furnace flame temperature selecting the most
   appropriate inputs that affect this process parameter. All data were
   collected from Erdemir Blast Furnace No. 2, located in Eregli, Turkey,
   during 3 months of operation and the computational results are
   satisfactory in terms of the selected performance criteria: regression
   coefficient and root mean squared error. When the proposed model outputs
   are considered for the comparison, it is seen that the ANN models show
   better performance than the MLR and ARIMA models.}},

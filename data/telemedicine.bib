Abstract = {{Collaborative processes are very important in telemedicine domain since
   they allow for making right decisions in complex situations with
   multidisciplinary staff. When modelling these collaborative processes,
   some inconsistencies can appear. In semantic modelling (conceptual
   graphs), these inconsistencies are verified using constraints. In this
   work, collaborative processes are represented using an argumentation
   system modelled in a conceptual graph formalism where inconsistencies
   could be particular bad attack relation between arguments. To overcome
   these inconsistencies, two solutions are proposed. The first one is to
   weight the arguments evolving in the argumentation system on the basis
   of the competencies of the health professionals and the credibility of
   the sources justifying their advice (arguments), and the second one is
   to model some law concepts as constraints in order to check their
   compliance of the collaborative process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{WhatsApp Use In The Evaluation of Hematuria}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The advancements in telemedicine provide the possibility
   to send photos of hematuria cases to professionals for further
   evaluation. We aimed to evaluate the inter-rater reliability of WhatsApp
   use in the evaluation of hematuria.
   Materials and methods: Between December 2014 and April 2016, 212
   patients were evaluated prospectively for hematuria by 2 groups of
   urologists; Group A: in direct contact with patients for evaluation;
   Group B: ``blind{''} urologist who had no access to the patients' data
   but received pictures via WhatsApp. Two photos of voided urine in a
   sterile container were taken and sent using WhatsApp. The opinions of
   Group A and B about the grade of hematuria were evaluated. Shapiro-Wilk
   test and Fleiss' kappa statistics were used for statistical analyses.
   Results: The median age of patients was 71 (min 22, max 96). The Group A
   urologists were in accordance in 96.22\% of cases. Group B urologists
   had common opinions in 99.5\% (n = 203) and there was almost perfect
   agreement between 2 groups (lambda = 0.992). The number of common
   opinions among ``blind{''} urologists is more than the number of common
   opinions among the consultants. When further classification is performed
   as serious and non-serious hematuria, the rate of misdiagnosing serious
   cases is approximately 6.5-7\%. However, using WhatsApp, the urologists
   can differentiate normal urine and any form of hematuria with 100\%
   accuracy.
   Conclusion: It is possible to evaluate hematuria remotely and also
   reduce unnecessary costs of services for hematuria of mild clinical
   significance by using telemedicine. WhatsApp can provide valuable aid to
   tertiary hospitals where the urologist is not always present as well as
   in rural areas.}},

Title = {{Remote Presence Robotic Technology Reduces Need for Pediatric
   Interfacility Transportation from an Isolated Northern Community}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Providing acutely ill children in isolated communities access
   to specialized care is challenging. This study aimed to evaluate remote
   presence robotic technology (RPRT) for enhancing pediatric remote
   assessments, expediting initiation of treatment, refining triaging, and
   reducing the need for transport.Methods:We conducted a pilot prospective
   observational study at a primary/urgent care clinic in an isolated
   northern community. Participants (n=38) were acutely ill children <17
   years presenting to the clinic, whom local healthcare professionals had
   considered for interfacility transportation (IFT). Participants were
   assessed and managed by a tertiary center pediatric intensivist through
   a remote presence robot. The intensivist triaged participants to either
   remain at the clinic or be transported to regional/tertiary care.
   Controls from a pre-existing local transport database were matched using
   propensity scoring. The primary outcome was the number of IFTs among
   participants versus controls.Results:Fourteen of 38 (37\%) participants
   required transport, whereas all controls were transported (p < 0.0001).
   Six of 14 (43\%) transported participants were triaged to a nearby
   regional hospital, while no controls were regionalized (p=0.0001). All
   participants who remained at the clinic stayed <24h, and were matched to
   controls who stayed 4.9 days in tertiary care (p < 0.001). There was no
   statistically significant difference in hospital length of stay between
   transported participants and controls (6.0 vs. 5.7
   days).Conclusions:RPRT reduced the need for specialized pediatric IFT,
   while enabling regionalization when appropriate. This study may have
   implications for the broader implementation of RPRT, while reducing
   costs to the healthcare system.}},

Title = {{Patterns and Correlates of Internet Use, Cell Phone Use, and Attitudes
   Toward Patient Portals Among a Predominantly Mexican-American Clinic
   Population}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe access and
   health-related use of the Internet and cell phones, and attitudes toward
   patient portals among a predominantly Hispanic patient population
   residing along the U.S.-Mexico border.
   Methods: A bilingual cross-sectional survey was conducted in two clinics
   to describe use and attitudes toward use of Web 2.0 technology for
   health-related activities. Univariate and multivariable analyses were
   conducted to identify factors associated with past Web 2.0 use and
   willingness to use these technologies in the future.
   Results: Two hundred and one participants were recruited (response rate:
   53.3\%). Respondents had an average age of 61.5 years, were
   predominantly female (63.2\%), Hispanic (71.6\%), of low income (93.0\%
   <\$25,000), and low educational attainment (49.8\% <high school). 44.8\%
   reported Internet access and 39.3\% reported Internet use. Barriers
   identified included access (80\%) and not knowing how to use the
   Internet (76.5\%). A majority (98.5\%) reported having a cell phone
   available in their house and 76.5\% had used a cell phone. 16.3\% had
   heard of a patient portal; 94.5\% agreed it was a good idea to review
   medical records, but only 49.2\% thought it was a good idea to review
   medical records online. In multivariable analyses, younger age (p <
   0.001) and higher health literacy were associated with willingness to
   use patient portals and younger age with text messaging.
   Conclusion: Significant barriers to use of Web 2.0 exist; incorporating
   Web 2.0 strategies into healthcare may still leave certain populations
   underserved.}},

Abstract = {{Telemedicine is a complex field including various applications and
   target groups. Especially telehealthcare is seen by many as a means to
   revolutionize medicine. It gives patients the opportunity to take charge
   of their own health by using self-tracking devices and allows health
   professionals to treat patients from a distance. To some, this means an
   empowerment of patient autonomy as well as an improvement in the quality
   of care. Others state the dangers of depersonalization of medicine and
   the pathologization of daily life. This paper examines the ethical
   implications of telehealthcare, focusing on patient autonomy and quality
   of care by analyzing metareviews, randomized controlled trials and
   narrative ethical analyses on the topic. As a result, we conclude that
   the technically enhanced encounter between patients and health
   professionals may mean an empowerment of patient autonomy when it goes
   along with a personal relationship based on trust, assistance and
   support. When it comes to the quality of care, telehealthcare may lead
   to an improvement as long it is adopted to the patient's individual
   needs.}},

Abstract = {{Several different applications of telehealth technologies have been used
   in the care of respiratory patients, including telemonitoring,
   teleconsultations, tele-education, and telehealth-pulmonary
   rehabilitation (PR). Telehealth technology provides an opportunity to
   assist in the management of chronic respiratory diseases and improve
   access to PR programs. While there is inconclusive evidence as to the
   effectiveness of telemonitoring to reduce healthcare utilization and
   detection of exacerbations, teleconsultations have been shown to be an
   effective means to assess patients' disease prior to the initiation of
   PR, and telehealth PR has been shown to be as effective as
   institution-based PR at improving functional exercise capacity and
   health-related quality of life. To improve PR access across Canada and
   ensure a high standard of program quality, a team of clinicians and
   researchers has developed and begun to implement a national standardized
   PR program that can be delivered across different settings of practice,
   including remote satellite sites via telehealth PR. The program has
   adapted the Living Well with COPD self-management program and includes
   standardized reference guides and resources for patients and
   practitioners. A progressive and iterative process will evaluate the
   success of program implementation and outcomes. This initiative will
   address nationwide accessibility challenges and provide PR content as
   well as evaluations that are in accordance with clinical standards and

Abstract = {{This study aimed to investigate computer and internet access and
   education attained in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease (COPD) as potential barriers to implementation of telemedicine.
   We prospectively assessed 98 patients admitted with an acute
   exacerbation of COPD (mean age: 70.5 +/- 9.3 years; force expired volume
   in the first second: 0.75 +/- 0.39 L; 59\% male) recording educational
   level attained and home computer and internet access. Hospital
   readmission surveillance occurred up to 2.7 (2.6-2.8) years following
   the index hospital admission. Only 16\% of patients had a computer and
   only 14\% had internet access; this group were younger and more educated
   than those without a computer. There was no difference in hospital
   readmissions over 2 years between those with and without access to a
   computer or internet. Only 12\% of the whole cohort were educated to a
   school leaving age of 16 years and this group were more likely to be
   still working. School leaving age was directly associated with fewer
   hospital readmissions (r = 0.251, p = 0.031). In conclusion, these data
   highlight the current challenges to the widespread implementation of
   telehealth in COPD patients as there is limited availability of computer
   and internet access with such patients demonstrating a lower level of
   education achievement.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart
   arrhythmia. It is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and
   mortality and its prevalence rises with age. The arrhythmia is often
   asymptomatic, and systematic AF screening could help identify
   asymptomatic individuals to implement therapeutic and preventive
   strategies. The main study aims were to test the technical feasibility
   and citizens' acceptance of a freely offered service in older people
   using community pharmacies.
   Materials and methods During 2 months, a 30-s single-lead
   electrocardiogram (ECG) with a telemedicine device was used for
   screening in 20 pharmacies in a mixed rural-urban health district of
   Northern Italy.
   Results A total of 289/335 older adults 70 years old or more agreed to
   participate in the study. A cardiologist considered 80\% of the ECG
   tracings readable and unknown AF was identified in 1.3\%.
   Conclusions The screening scheme appears technically feasible and
   acceptable both to professionals and citizens/participants. Training the
   pharmacists could ensure broader participation and substantially improve
   the pharmacies' overall performance.}},

Title = {{A Cost Comparison for Telehealth Utilization in the Kidney Transplant
   Waitlist Evaluation Process}},
Journal = {{TRANSPLANTATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{279-283}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background. There have been limited publications on telehealth
   utilization in transplantation with no prior reports of
   telehealthrelated costs for pretransplant evaluations. The aim of this
   study is to compare costs throughout the evaluation process for those
   patients assessed initially by telehealth with those seen in-person.
   Methods. All patients approved for kidney transplant waitlist evaluation
   at our center from March 2013 thru May 2016 with decisions were included
   in this study. Patients approved for evaluation were scheduled for
   either an initial telehealth or in-person visit, partly based on patient
   factors. Clinically related and travelrelated costs were calculated.
   Time estimates for patient time needed to complete visit, time from
   application approval to initial visit, and time from application
   approval to decision were obtained. Comparisons were made using t tests.
   Results. Thirty-nine months were included for 302 patients. All
   categories of clinically or travel-related costs were significantly less
   for the telehealth cohort (P < 0.0001). Total mean cost per patient was
   US\$656.11 versus US\$1108.91 for the cohort initially evaluated by
   telehealth versus in-person (P < 0.001). The time needed to complete an
   evaluation (1.7 vs 2.4 days, P < 0.001) and the time to initial
   evaluation (51.4 vs 87.9.0 days, P < 0.001) were significantly less in
   the telehealth cohort. The cohort seen by telehealth was older with
   increased comorbidities (< 0.001). Conclusions. As telemedicine
   applications continue to proliferate, we present our experience with
   telehealth for initial kidney transplant waitlist evaluations with
   associated reductions in cost and time which may also improve access to
   transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Information Communication and Technology for Health (ICT4H) initiatives,
   such as telemedicine, can potentially bridge the gap between the health
   care services available in rural and urban areas. However most of such
   initiatives have not been able to sustain or obtain optimal results.
   Comprehending knowledge about what drives success in telemedicine
   initiatives would be highly valuable for practitioners, policymakers and
   academicians. In this study, through a qualitative analysis of
   doctor-patient interactions over a telemedicine initiative in India, we
   attempt to identify the mechanisms that can enable successful
   telemedicine interventions. Based on the perspective of critical
   realism, we explore the phenomenon through the lens of `generative
   mechanisms'. Specifically, we identify three different mechanisms that
   underlie successful telemedicine, namely, (1) Mechanism of rich
   connectivity, which refers to the expanding scope of information flow
   between the nodes to include multiple aspects-clinical, managerial and
   technological; and both online and offline communication; (2) Mechanism
   of tutoring, which involves learning and skill development of the
   peripheral doctor; and (3) Mechanism of moulding, which concerns the
   moulding of naive patients to expert patients, both in technology use
   and self management of disease. In addition, the paper demonstrates the
   efficacy of critical realism as a philosophical perspective for
   providing substantive insights in the field of ICT4H initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{Stroke is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in Spain and in
   Galicia in particular. Tissue viability after stroke depends on the time
   taken to restore circulation. The widely dispersed and aging population
   of this region challenges efforts to provide equal care for patients
   with time-sensitive emergencies such as stroke. Two regional hospitals
   (Hospital do Salnes and Hospital do Barbanza) and the reference Hospital
   Clinic de Santiago launched a telestroke pilot program in 2011 in which
   patients whose treatment was guided at a distance were discharged with
   lower levels of stroke severity and mortality. That outcome was probably
   attributable to more rapid diagnosis. Given those preliminary results
   and the characteristics of the population, the centrally coordinated
   Galician Stroke Care Plan was launched in 2016 to provide a telemedicine
   service that connects all hospitals in the health system of Galicia.
   This paper summarizes the experience of developing and implementing the
   program.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundTelemedical care and monitoring programs for patients with
   chronic heart failure have shown beneficial effects on survival in
   several small studies. The utility in routine care remains unclear.
   MethodsWe evaluated a large-sized telemedicine program in a routine care
   setting, enrolling in total 2,622 patients (54.7 percent male, mean age:
   73.7years) with chronic heart failure. We used reimbursement data from a
   large statutory health insurance and approached a matched control
   analysis. In a complex propensity score matching procedure, 3,719
   suitable controls (54.2 percent male, mean age: 74.5years) were matched
   to 1,943 intervention patients (54.1 percent male, mean age: 74.4years).
   The primary endpoint of our analysis was survival after 1year.
   ResultsAnalyses revealed a higher survival probability among subjects of
   the intervention group compared to controls group after 1year (adjusted
   OR: 1.47, CI 95 percent: 1.21-1.80, p<.001) and 2years (adjusted OR:
   1.51, CI 95 percent: 1.28-1.77, p<.001), respectively.
   ConclusionsThe probabilities to survive after 1 and 2years were
   significantly increased in the intervention group. Our findings confirm
   previous results of controlled trials and importantly indicate that
   patients with chronic heart failure may benefit from telemonitoring
   programs in routine care.}},

Abstract = {{The growing worldwide population has increased the need for
   technologies, computerised software algorithms and smart devices that
   can monitor and assist patients anytime and anywhere and thus enable
   them to lead independent lives. The real-time remote monitoring of
   patients is an important issue in telemedicine. In the provision of
   healthcare services, patient prioritisation poses a significant
   challenge because of the complex decision-making process it involves
   when patients are considered `big data'. To our knowledge, no study has
   highlighted the link between `big data' characteristics and real-time
   remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation process, as
   well as the inherent challenges involved. Thus, we present comprehensive
   insights into the elements of big data characteristics according to the
   six `Vs': volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value and variability.
   Each of these elements is presented and connected to a related part in
   the study of the connection between patient prioritisation and realtime
   remote healthcare monitoring systems. Then, we determine the weak points
   and recommend solutions as potential future work. This study makes the
   following contributions. (1) The link between big data characteristics
   and real-time remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation
   process is described. (2) The open issues and challenges for big data
   used in the patient prioritisation process are emphasised. (3) As a
   recommended solution, decision making using multiple criteria, such as
   vital signs and chief complaints, is utilised to prioritise the big data
   of patients with chronic diseases on the basis of the most urgent cases.}},

Journal = {{LARYNGOSCOPE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{350-355}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objectives/Hypothesis: Prolonged wait times have become common.
   Electronic consultations (eConsults) have been shown in previous studies
   to reduce unnecessary face-to-face consultations to specialists, but no
   prior study has investigated the feasibility or efficacy of eConsults in
   an otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OTO-HNS) practice.
   Study Design: Prospective observational study.
   Methods: The Champlain BASE eConsult system is a secure web portal
   allowing primary care physicians (PCPs) to communicate asynchronously
   with specialists about a patient, without requiring a formal
   face-to-face consult. The data from all eConsults sent through this
   portal to OTO-HNS practices between July 2011 and January 2015 were
   collected and analyzed.
   Results: Response time was rapid; over 40\% of eConsults received a
   response within 24 hours, and nearly all eConsults were answered within
   7 calendar days. The median response time was nearly 29 times faster
   than traditional face-to-face consultation. Unnecessary face-to-face
   referrals were avoided in 33.4\% of all eConsults, and in nearly 50\% of
   cases where the PCP initially planned a formal referral. PCPs reported
   adopting a new or additional course of action over 50\% of the time
   following an eConsult. Eighty-eight percent of PCPs reported the service
   to be valuable for their patients, and 92\% found it valuable for
   themselves. eConsults require only a limited time commitment from
   specialists, with over 75\% taking less than 10 minutes to complete.
   Conclusions: eConsultation is a cost-effective system that can lead to
   decreased wait times, improved communication between PCPs and
   otolaryngologists, and help guide the development of targeted continuing
   professional development modules for PCPs.}},

   Triage Environments}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: With the development of the commercial space industry,
   growing numbers of spaceflight participants will engage in activities
   with a risk for pulmonary injuries, including pneumothorax, ebullism,
   and decompression sickness, as well as other concomitant trauma. Medical
   triage capabilities for mishaps involving pulmonary conditions have not
   been systematically reviewed. Recent studies have advocated the use of
   point-of-care ultrasound to screen for lung injury or illness. The
   operational utility of portable ultrasound systems in disaster relief
   and other austere settings may be relevant to commercial spaceflight.
   METHODS: A systematic review of published literature was conducted
   concerning the use of point-of-care pulmonary ultrasound techniques in
   austere environments, including suggested examination protocols for
   triage and diagnosis.
   RESULTS: Recent studies support the utility of pulmonary ultrasound
   examinations when performed by skilled operators, and comparability of
   the results to computed tomography and chest radiography for certain
   conditions, with important implications for trauma management in austere
   environments.
   DISCUSSION: Pulmonary injury and illness are among the potential health
   risks facing spaceflight participants. Implementation of point-of-care
   ultrasound protocols could aid in the rapid diagnosis, triage, and
   treatment of such conditions. Though operator-dependent, ultrasound,
   with proper training, experience, and equipment, could be a valuable
   tool in the hands of a first responder supporting remote spaceflight
   operations.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Demographic trends with extended life expectancy are placing increasing
   pressures on the UK state-funded healthcare budgets. eHealth innovations
   are expected to facilitate new avenues for cost-effective and safe
   methods of care, for enabling elderly people to live independently at
   their own homes and for assisting governments to cope with the
   demographic challenges. However, despite heavy investment in these
   innovations, large-scale deployment of eHealth continues to face
   significant obstacles, and lack of sustainable business models (BMs) is
   widely regarded as part of the greatest barriers. Through various
   empirical methods that include facilitated workshops, case studies of
   relevant organizations, and user groups, this paper investigates the
   reasons the private market of eHealth innovations has proved difficult
   to establish, and therefore it develops a framework for sustainable BMs
   that could elimiesnate barriers of eHealth innovation commercialization.
   Results of the study suggest that to achieve sustainable
   commercialization, BM frameworks and innovation diffusion
   characteristics should be considered complements but not substitutes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Tremendous interest and need lie at the intersection of
   telemedicine and minimally invasive surgery. Robotics provides an ideal
   environment for surgical telementoring and telesurgery given its
   endoscopic optics and mechanized instrument movement. We review the
   present status, current challenges and future promise of telemedicine in
   endoscopic and minimally invasive surgery with a focus on urological
   applications.
   Materials and Methods: Two paired investigators screened PubMed (R),
   Scopus (R) and Web of Science (R) databases for all full text English
   language articles published between 1995 and 2016 using the key words
   ``telemedicine,{''} ``minimally invasive surgical procedure,{''}
   ``robotic surgical procedure,{''} ``education{''} and ``distance.{''} We
   categorized and included studies of level of interaction between
   proctors and trainees. Research design, special equipment,
   telecommunication network bandwidth and research outcomes of each study
   were ascertained and analyzed.
   Results: Of 65 identified reports 38 peer-reviewed studies qualified for
   inclusion. Series were categorized into 4 advancing levels, ie verbal
   guidance, guidance with telestration, guidance with tele-assist and
   telesurgery. More advanced levels of surgical telementoring provide more
   effective and experiential teaching but are associated with increased
   telecommunication network bandwidth requirements and expenses. Concerns
   regarding patient safety and legal, financial, economic and ethical
   issues remain to be reconciled.
   Conclusions: Telementoring and telesurgery in minimally invasive surgery
   are becoming more practical and cost effective in facilitating teaching
   of advanced surgical skills worldwide and delivery of surgical care to
   underserved areas, yet many challenges remain. Maturity of these
   modalities depends on financial incentives, favorable legislation and
   collaboration with cybersecurity experts to ensure safety and
   cost-effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Seafarers are an understudied and essential workforce,
   isolated from medical care. This study describes injuries, illness, and
   risk factors for resultant disability in one shipping company with a
   majority of American seafarers.
   Methods: The study used a telemedicine database of injury and illness
   incidence in seafarers, and applied descriptive statistical methods and
   logistic regression modeling.
   Results: Illnesses were more frequently reported than injuries (860 vs
   479). The overall injury rate was 113 per 1000 person-years, and the
   overall illness rate was 211 per 1000 person-years. Seafarer ratings had
   higher risk for disability compared to officers (OR = 1.60; 95\%CI 1.17,
   2.18), and incidents on dry cargo ships (OR = 2.70; 95\%CI 1.49, 4.91)
   and articulated tug-barges (ATBs) (OR = 2.21; 95\%CI 1.26, 3.86) had

Abstract = {{Background:Patient-targeted Googling (PTG) describes the searching on
   the Internet by healthcare professionals for information about patients
   with or without their knowledge.Introduction:Little research has been
   conducted into PTG internationally. PTG can have particular ethical
   implications within the field of mental health. This study was
   undertaken to identify the extent of PTG by New Zealand mental
   healthcare professionals and needs for further guidance regarding this
   issue.Materials and Methods:All (1,850) psychiatrists, clinical
   psychologists, and psychotherapists working in New Zealand were
   electronically surveyed about their experience of PTG and knowledge
   about the associated practice of therapist-targeted Googling (TTG) using
   a questionnaire that had previously been developed with a German sample.
   Due to ethics and advertising restrictions, only one indirect approach
   was made to potential participants.Results:Eighty-eight clinicians (5\%)
   responded to the survey invitation. More than half (53.4\%, N=47) of
   respondents reportedly being engaged in PTG, but only a minority
   (10.3\%, N=9) had ever received any education about the subject. Reasons
   for undertaking PTG included facilitating the therapeutic process,
   information being in the public domain, and mitigating risks. Reasons
   against undertaking PTG included impairment of therapeutic relationship,
   unethical invasion of privacy, and concerns regarding the accuracy and
   clinical relevance of online information. Two-thirds of participants
   reported being the subject of TTG.Discussion:New Zealand psychiatrists,
   clinical psychologists, and psychotherapists are engaging in PTG with
   limited education and professional guidance. Further discussion and
   research are required, and so, PTG is undertaken in a manner that is
   safe and useful for patients and health practitioners.}},

Title = {{Rate of Symptomatic Intracerebral Hemorrhage Related to Intravenous tPA
   Administered Over Telestroke Within 4.5-Hour Window}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) remains the
   cornerstone medical treatment for acute ischemic stroke. The
   establishment of telestroke technology has allowed patients presenting
   to hospitals that lack expert stroke care to be evaluated and receive
   tPA. The safety of tPA administered through telestroke has been
   evaluated only when tPA is given within the 3-h window of last known
   normal. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of tPA when
   administered through telestroke within a 4.5-h window.Methods:A
   retrospective analysis on the prospectively collected database for all
   patients who received tPA at the Medical University of South Carolina
   Comprehensive Stroke Center (MUSC) (hub), as well as the MUSC telestroke
   network partner hospitals (spokes), was performed. Collected data
   included demographics, baseline characteristics, time from last known
   well to tPA administration, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage
   (sICH) rates. Logistic regression was used to examine the odds of a sICH
   in patients at spoke sites compared with the hub controlling for patient
   stroke severity, gender, age, and race.Results:A total of 830 patients
   were identified. Median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale was
   significantly higher among patients treated at the hub (9 vs. 8,
   p=0.013), and the hub treated a higher percentage of nonwhite patients
   (p=0.039). sICH occurred in 27 (4.8\%) in the spoke group and 10 (3.8\%)
   in the hub group (p=0.523). Logistic regression results found no
   significant difference in the odds of sICH if tPA is given in a spoke
   site.Conclusions:Our study shows similar rates of sICH when intravenous
   tPA is administered at spokes through telestroke network compared with
   the hub.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, ubiquitous-based telemedicine has become increasingly
   popular in many countries; this is a new discipline that can break
   distance barriers in order to improve access to various medical
   services. Due to recent progress in telecare services, scientists
   provided those pregnant women with advanced medical care via medical
   cyber-physical systems (MCPS) to achieve eugenics. The MCPS presents a
   new level of integrated intelligence that is characterized by
   interaction and coordination of computing processes with physical
   processes. In an environment of MCPS, security is one of the key
   objectives for ubiquitous telemonitoring. In this paper, we take
   advantage of the cloud characteristics and the high efficiency of MCPS
   to achieve the desired medical monitoring and also to effectively
   protect pregnancy-related privacy. We establish a cloud computing

Title = {{Validation of Electronic Activity Monitor Devices During Treadmill
   Walking}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of
   the step count measurement of commercial electronic activity monitor
   devices. Two popular models, Fitbit Charge HR and Mi Band 2, were
   selected for treadmill walking in a single session.
   Materials and Methods: Thirty healthy volunteers walked at five
   predetermined speeds (0.90, 1.12, 1.33, 1.54, and 1.78 m/s) on a
   treadmill with both Fitbit Charge HR and Mi Band 2 worn on their
   dominant hand's wrist. Observers counted the steps, with the aid of
   taped video, which was taken as the criterion measure for steps. The
   validity of the electronic activity devices was assessed by (1) Paired
   sample t test with the criterion measures and (2) Pearson's correlation
   coefficients and the corresponding p-values were calculated to compare
   the output of devices with manual step count. In addition, Bland-Altman
   plots were constructed to visually inspect the data and to assess
   agreement with the criterion measures.
   Results: There were no significant differences in step measurement
   between Fitbit Charge HR and Mi Band 2 with the criterion measures.
   Besides, there was a very strong agreement between step count
   measurements obtained using the Fitbit Charge HR (r = 0.99) and the Mi
   Band 2 (r = 0.99), at five predetermined speeds while comparing with the
   observed step counts.
   Conclusion: Both Fitbit Charge HR and Mi Band 2 provided accurate step
   count measurement in the treadmill walking test.}},

Title = {{A Virtual Environment-Based Training System for a Blind Wheelchair User
   Through Use of Three-Dimensional Audio Supported by
   Electroencephalography}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{People with disabilities encounter many difficulties, especially when a
   diagnosis of more than one dysfunction is made, as is the case for
   visually impaired wheelchair users. In fact, this scenario generates a
   degree of incapacity in terms of the performance of basic activities on
   the part of the wheelchair user. The treatment of disabled patients is
   performed in an individualized manner according to their particular
   clinical aspects. People with visual and motor disabilities are
   restricted in independent navigation. In this navigation scenario, there
   is a requirement for interaction that justifies the use of virtual
   reality (VR). In addition, locomotion needs to be under natural control
   to be successfully incorporated. Based on such a condition,
   electroencephalography (EEG) has shown great advances in the area of
   health by employing spontaneous brain signals. This research
   demonstrates, through an experiment, the use of a wheelchair adapted to
   have the support of VR and EEG for training of locomotion and
   individualized interaction of wheelchair users with visual impairment.
   The objective was to provide efficient interactions, thus allowing the
   social inclusion of patients who are considered otherwise incapacitated.
   This project was based on the following criteria: natural control,
   feedback, stimuli, and safety. A multilayer computer rehabilitation
   system was developed that incorporated natural interaction supported by
   EEG, which activated the movements in the virtual environment and real
   wheelchair through adequately performed experiments. This research
   consisted of elaborating a suitable approach for blind wheelchair user
   patients. The results demonstrated that the use of VR with EEG signals
   has the potential for improving the quality of life and independence of
   blind wheelchair users.}},

Title = {{Teledermatology in the United States: An Update in a Dynamic Era}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background: Teledermatology is rapidly advancing in the United States.
   The last comprehensive survey of U.S. teledermatology programs was
   conducted in 2011.
   Introduction: This article provides an update regarding the state of
   teledermatology programs in the United States.
   Materials and Methods: Active programs were identified and surveyed from
   November 2014 to January 2017. Findings regarding practice settings,
   consult volumes, payment methods, and delivery modalities were compared
   to those from the 2011 survey. Findings from the Veterans Affairs (VA)
   were reported as an aggregate.
   Results: There were 40 active nongovernmental programs, amounting to a
   48\% increase and 30\% discontinuation rate over five years. Academia
   remained the most common practice setting (50\%). Median annual
   consultation volume was comparable with 263 consultations, but maximum
   annual consultation volume increased (range: 20-20,000). The most
   frequent payment method was self-pay (53\%). Store-and-forward continued
   to be the most common delivery modality. In Fiscal Year 2016, the VA
   System consisted of 62 consultation sites and performed a total of
   101,507 consultations.
   Discussion: The limitations of this study were that consult volume and
   payment methods were not available from all programs.
   Conclusion: U.S. teledermatology programs have increased in number and
   annual consultation volume. Academia is the most prevalent practice
   setting, and self-pay is the dominant accepted payment method.
   Innovative platforms and the provision of direct-to-patient care are
   changing the practice of teledermatology.}},

Title = {{Clinical Inertia in a Randomized Trial of Telemedicine-Based Chronic
   Disease Management: Lessons Learned}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Treatment nonadherence and clinical inertia perpetuate poor
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor control. Telemedicine
   interventions may counter both treatment nonadherence and clinical
   inertia.Introduction:We explored why a telemedicine intervention
   designed to reduce treatment nonadherence and clinical inertia did not
   improve CVD risk factor control, despite enhancing treatment adherence
   versus usual care.Methods:In this analysis of a randomized trial, we
   studied recipients of the 12-month telemedicine intervention. This
   intervention comprised two nurse-administered components: (1) monthly
   self-management education targeting improved treatment adherence; and
   (2) quarterly medication management facilitation designed to support
   treatment intensification by primary care (thereby reducing clinical
   inertia). For each medication management facilitation encounter, we
   ascertained whether patients met treatment goals, and if not, whether
   primary care recommended treatment intensification following the
   encounter. We assessed disease control associated with encounters, where
   intensification was/was not recommended.Results:We examined 455
   encounters across 182 intervention recipients (100\% African Americans
   with type 2 diabetes). Even after accounting for valid reasons for
   deferring intensification (e.g., treatment nonadherence),
   intensification was not recommended in 67.5\% of encounters in which
   hemoglobin A1c was above goal, 72.5\% in which systolic blood pressure
   was above goal, and 73.9\% in which low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
   was above goal. In each disease state, treatment intensification was
   more likely with poorer control.Conclusions:Despite enhancing treatment
   adherence, this intervention was unsuccessful in countering clinical
   inertia, likely explaining its lack of effect on CVD risk factors. We
   identify several lessons learned that may benefit investigators and
   healthcare systems.}},

   Care: Multi-center Randomized Controlled Trial}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:This study was performed to determine the effectiveness of
   the Smart Care service on glucose control based on telemedicine and
   telemonitoring compared with conventional treatment in patients with
   type 2 diabetes.Materials and Methods:This 24-week prospective
   multi-center randomized controlled trial involved 338 adult patients
   with type 2 diabetes at four university hospitals in South Korea. The
   patients were randomly assigned to a control group (group A, n=113), a
   telemonitoring group (group B, n=113), or a telemedicine group (group C,
   n=112). Patients in the telemonitoring group visited the outpatient
   clinic regularly, accompanied by an additional telemonitoring service
   that included remote glucose monitoring with automated patient decision
   support by text. Remote glucose monitoring was identical in the
   telemedicine group, but assessment by outpatient visits was replaced by
   video conferencing with an endocrinologist.Results:The adjusted net
   reductions inHbA1c concentration after 24 weeks were similar in the
   conventional, telemonitoring, and telemedicine groups (-0.66\%1.03\% vs.
   -0.66\%+/- 1.09\% vs. -0.81\%+/- 1.05\%; p > 0.05 for each pairwise
   comparison). Fasting glucose concentrations were lower in the
   telemonitoring and telemedicine groups than in the conventional group.
   Rates of hypoglycemia were lower in the telemedicine group than in the
   other two groups, and compliance with medication was better in the
   telemonitoring and telemedicine than in the conventional group. No
   serious adverse events were associated with
   telemedicine.Conclusions:Telehealthcare was as effective as conventional
   care at improving glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes without
   serious adverse effects.}},

Abstract = {{The global availability, strong resiliency and bandwidth management
   capability of the satellite technology together with the need of ICT
   solutions for the provision of reliable e-health services lead to the
   development of innovative technological mechanisms to be adopted in a
   comprehensive network resources management system for integrated
   professional medical services. A new paradigm of satellite telemedicine
   is proposed by the European Space Agency project, KosmoMed. Its aim is
   to design, develop, deploy and validate an ICT Professional Medical
   Platform for the delivery of innovative applications through an
   integrated satellite terrestrial network. To satisfy the end-user
   requirements in terms of perceived quality, a distributed booking
   databases system for the network resource management has been developed.
   A user-transparent system that automatically adapts the satellite
   bandwidth resources and activates the proper quality of service (QoS)
   strategies based on the requested service has been implemented. The
   overall system has been validated and an experimental campaign has been
   carried out. The fulfilment of the identified requirements is
   demonstrated by the QoS and quality of experience (QoE) results. This

Title = {{Teleneurology for Veterans in a Major Metropolitan Area}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background: The recent growth in telehealth has been facilitated by the
   need to deliver healthcare to patients living in remote or rural areas.
   In contrast, the role of telehealth in more urban settings is less
   clear. A teleneurology program was established in 2011 at the Tibor
   Rubin VA Medical Center (TRVAMC) in Long Beach, California. A review of
   teleneurology encounters was conducted to assess the feasibility of
   applying this telehealth modality to patients with chronic neurological
   disorders living in an urban setting.
   Methods: Teleneurology encounters were conducted by clinical video
   telehealth (CVT) between a provider at the TRVAMC and patients at local
   community-based outpatient clinics from November 2011 to December 2014.
   In a random sampling of veterans, they were asked to complete a patient
   satisfaction survey.
   Results: A total of 745 teleneurology encounters were performed
   including 570 unique patients. Veterans with a broad range of
   neurological disorders were seen, including Parkinson's disease,
   headaches, epilepsy, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral
   nervous system disorders, multiple sclerosis, and other problems such as
   dizziness and paresthesia. Compared with patients in face-to-face
   clinics, patients in teleneurology clinics consistently kept their
   appointments. Technical problems were rare and easily resolved. The
   majority of patients were satisfied with the care they received through
   teleneurology, and preferred CVT rather than a face-to-face encounter.
   Conclusions: This report demonstrates the successful application of
   telehealth to evaluate and manage a diverse group of neurological
   disorders in an urban setting. Despite the relatively short distances
   involved, the majority of patients preferred telehealth over
   face-to-face encounters.}},

Title = {{A Systematic Review on the Validity of Teledentistry}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Objectives:The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the
   validity of using teledentistry in oral care examination and
   diagnosis.Methods:In June 2016, a systematic search of the literature
   was conducted without time restrictions in three electronic databases
   (Ebscohost, Pubmed, and Scopus). Two reviewers screened the retrieved
   articles first by title and then by abstract to determine relevant
   articles for full text review. Studies included were as follows: (1)
   related to teledentistry, (2) available in full text and English, (3)
   compared teledentistry application to a gold standard, and (4) provided
   clear statistical tests for validity. The methodological quality of
   studies was determined using the Quality Assessment of Studies of
   Diagnostic Accuracy (QUADAS).Results:Seventy-nine studies met the
   initial search criteria. Following removal of duplicate articles, only
   58 were remaining and reviewed by title and abstract, yielding 14
   full-text articles. Nine of the full-text articles met the inclusion
   criteria. Results of the QUADAS assessment varied from 9 to 13 out of 14
   items; therefore, studies demonstrated high quality (>60\%). Validity of
   teledentistry varied and is reported by range for the following
   statistics: sensitivity (n=8, 25-100\%), specificity (n=7, 68-100\%),
   positive predictive value (n=5, 57-100\%), and negative predictive value
   (n=5, 50-100\%). Kappa statistics were also reported for evaluation of
   reliability between gold standard and teledentistry examination (n=6,
   46-93\%).Conclusions:Teledentistry could be comparable to face-to-face
   for oral screening, especially in school-based programs, rural areas and
   areas with limited access to care, and long-term care facilities.
   Identification of oral diseases, referrals, and teleconsultations are
   possible and valid. The need for methodologically designed studies with
   appropriate statistical tests to determine the validity of teledentistry
   exists.}},

Title = {{Validity and Reliability Evaluation of Four Commercial Activity
   Trackers' Step Counting Performance}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Introduction:Activity trackers are useful tools for physical
   rehabilitation purposes. Most available activity trackers are designed
   for fitness and wellness use, lacking in both accuracy and precision at
   lower speeds. Validity and reliability at all clinically relevant speeds
   are crucial selection criteria for use in clinical practice. The aim of
   this study was to assess the validity and reliability of four
   consumer-based activity trackers at clinical relevant walking speeds for
   patient groups undergoing rehabilitation.Methods:The four commercial
   activity trackers Fitbit Surge (FS), Fitbit Charge HR (FC), Microsoft
   Band 2 (MB), and A\&D 101NFC Activity Monitor (A\&D) were evaluated at
   2, 4, 4.5, and 5.5km/h. Twenty healthy participants aged 25.62 years
   walked on a treadmill at the four velocities in two trials of 100 steps
   each. Mean average percentage error (MAPE), intraclass correlation
   coefficient (ICC), and Bland-Altman 95\% limits of agreement were
   calculated to assess validity and reliability.Results:MAPE levels were
   between -8\% and -6\% for FS, -15\% and 0\% for MB, 7\% and 21\% for FC,
   and -53\% and 1\% for AD. The biggest inaccuracies were seen at 2km/h,
   where AD underestimated by 53\%. The highest accuracy was predominantly
   found with MB and AD, which overestimated 2\% at velocities 4km/h. ICC
   was moderate (0.73) for FS, good (0.88) for MB, moderate (0.52) for FC,
   and excellent (0.98) for AD.Conclusions:MB, FS, and AD accurately
   counted steps, when participants walked with velocities corresponding to
   a brisk walk (4km/h). Walking at lower speeds (2km/h) was not counted
   accurately. Thus, the four evaluated activity trackers are not useful
   for patient groups walking at lower speeds during rehabilitation, nor
   for counting indoor walking.}},

Title = {{Development and Validation of Telemedicine for Disaster Response: The
   North Atlantic Treaty Organization Multinational System}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Disasters, whether natural or manmade, are unpredictable.
   While there may be some forewarning as in natural disasters like a
   hurricane, response is often suboptimal. There is a need for an
   integrated and structured action for all three well defined phases of
   disaster management (pre-, during, and postdisaster) that must be
   addressed to ameliorate the impact on life and the necessary steps for
   recovery. Over the past several decades, telemedicine has been
   integrated in some form of disaster response. This adoption and
   integration has been shown to be effective. Since 2013, North Atlantic
   Treaty Organization (NATO), under the auspices of the Science for Peace
   and Security Programme, has worked on developing a Multinational
   Telemedicine System (MnTS) for disaster response.Methods:A group of
   subject matter experts from Europe and the United States developed the
   MnTS by establishing the network and a concept of operations, to be used
   in disaster management between countries.Results:An integrated system,
   including personnel, hardware, communication protocols, portable power
   generation, medical kits, and Web-based tools, was developed and
   successfully tested in the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination
   Centre's Exercises Ukraine 2015. The field exercise tested and validated
   the MnTS and identified areas of improvement. The system and its
   evaluation provide additional information for establishing deployment
   capabilities.Conclusions:A MnTS approach to telemedicine in disaster
   response and management is possible and should be further advanced.}},

Title = {{A Hybrid Form of Telemedicine: A Unique Way to Extend Intensive Care
   Service to Neonates in Medically Underserved Areas}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:More than 90\% of neonatal intensive care units(NICUs) in the
   United States are in urban areas, denying rural residents' easy NICU
   access. Telemedicine use for patient contact and management, although
   studied in adults and children, is understudied in neonates. A hybrid
   telemedicine system, with 24/7 neonatal nurse practitioner coverage and
   with a neonatologist physically present 3 days per week and telemedicine
   coverage the remaining days, was recently implemented at Comanche County
   Memorial Hospital's (CCMH) Level II NICU.Objective:To compare outcomes
   of moderately ill infants between 32-35 weeks gestational age (GA)
   managed by our hybrid telemedicine program with outcomes of similar
   neonates receiving standard care in a Level IV NICU at Oklahoma
   University Medical Center (OUMC).Design/Methods:This was a
   retrospective, noninferiority study comparing outcomes of neonates
   receiving hybrid telemedicine versus standard care. All 32-35 weeks GA
   infants admitted between July 2013 and June 2015 were included. OUMC
   infants came from areas geographically comparable with CCMH. Infants
   requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation or advanced subspecialty
   services were excluded. Outcome variables were length of stay, type and
   duration of respiratory support, length of antibiotic therapy, and time
   to full enteral feedings.Results:Eighty-seven neonates at CCMH and 56
   neonates at OUMC were included in the analysis. Compared with neonates
   at OUMC, neonates at CCMH had shorter hospitalizations, fewer days of
   supplemental oxygen, and fewer noninvasive ventilation support days, and
   reached full enteral feeds sooner.Conclusions:The hybrid telemedicine
   system is a safe and effective strategy for extending intensive care to
   neonates in medically underserved areas.}},

Title = {{The Influence of Telepathology on Coordination Practices}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Coordination between physicians and allied professionals is
   essential to the effective delivery of care services and is associated
   with positive patient outcomes. As information technology can radically
   transform how professionals collaborate, both researchers and healthcare
   accreditation bodies are devoting a growing interest to the means of
   achieving better coordination.Introduction:The primary aim of this study
   is to explain the extent to which and how coordination practices between
   pathologists, technologists, and surgeons are transformed when
   telepathology is being implemented.Materials and Methods:An interpretive
   case study was conducted. A total of 60 semistructured interviews with
   key participants were conducted, in addition to several days of direct
   observation of telepathology-based intraoperative consultations
   (IOCs).Results:Three major kinds of transformation of coordination
   practices were observed. First, the telepathology system itself
   constrains and disrupts coordination routines, such as the presentation
   of slides. Second, anticipating IOC, proactively performed by the
   laboratory personnel in traditional settings, requires more formal
   requests in a telepathology context. Third, local technologists become
   more autonomous in performing complex macroscopy manipulations and
   managing the laboratory tasks traditionally performed by
   pathologists.Conclusions:Successful coordination of work in a
   telepathology-based IOC context requires that significant
   transformations be anticipated and accounted for. Project managers need
   to formalize new work processes, support the transformations in
   professional roles, and mitigate the major hindrances that small
   material changes may have on work routines.}},

Title = {{Pediatric Dentistry in Primary Healthcare: Creation, Development, and
   Evaluation of a Distance Education Course}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background: Oral health in childhood is a major problem for global
   public health. In Brazil, the prevalence of childhood tooth decay varies
   from 12\% to 46\%. Dental care treatment in Brazil is almost the
   exclusive responsibility of primary healthcare (PHC). Therefore, it is
   essential these professionals are prepared to conduct restorative,
   endodontic, and exodontic treatments and preventive care in children.
   Introduction: Children make up a large proportion of the population in
   territories requiring advanced dental care provided by PHC in Brazil. To
   care for these patients, it is necessary to have both manual dexterity
   and technical knowledge of pediatric dentistry. Accordingly, this study
   aimed to develop a distance course on pediatric dentistry.
   Materials and Methods: A pretest questionnaire consisting of 15
   questions was used to assess initial dental knowledge of participants.
   After completion of a five-module course, participants retook the same
   initial dental knowledge questionnaire (post-test). Descriptive
   statistic and paired t test, one-way analysis of variance, and Pearson
   and Spearman correlation were used, and a significance level of 5\% was
   set.
   Results: The majority of participants completing the five-module course
   were women who earned specialty degrees beyond undergraduate studies and
   currently worked in PHC (>5 years). Participant performance on the
   dental knowledge questionnaire after completion of the five-module
   course improved pre- to post-test.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that completion of a distance course on
   pediatric dentistry can be an effective tool for improving knowledge of
   pediatric dentistry in PHC professionals.}},

Title = {{Nursing Home Provider Perceptions of Telemedicine for Providing
   Specialty Consults}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background: Nursing homes (NHs) provide care to a complex patient
   population and face the ongoing challenge of meeting resident needs for
   specialty care. A NH telemedicine care model could improve access to
   remote specialty providers.
   Introduction: Little is known about provider interest in telemedicine
   for specialty consults in the NH setting. The goal of this study was to
   survey a national sample of NH physicians and advanced practice
   providers to document their views on telemedicine for providing
   specialty consults in the NH.
   Materials and Methods: We surveyed physician and advanced practice
   providers who attended the 2016 AMDA-The Society for Post-Acute and
   Long-Term Care Medicine Annual Conference about their likelihood of
   referral to and perceptions of a telemedicine program for providing
   specialty consults in the NH.
   Results: We received surveys from 524 of the 1,274 conference attendees
   for a 41.1\% response rate. Respondents expressed confidence in the
   ability of telemedicine to fill existing service gaps and provide
   appropriate, timelier care. Providers showed the highest level of
   interest in telemedicine for dermatology, geriatric psychiatry, and
   infectious disease. Only 13\% of respondents indicated that telemedicine
   was available for use in one of their facilities.
   Discussion: There appears to be unmet demand for telemedicine in NHs for
   providing specialty consults to residents.
   Conclusions: The responses of NH providers suggest support for the
   concept of telemedicine as a modality of care that can be used to offer
   specialty consults to NH residents.}},

Title = {{Emergency Department Telemedicine Shortens Rural Time-to-Provider and
   Emergency Department Transfer Times}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background: Emergency department (ED)-based telemedicine has been
   implemented in many rural hospitals to provide specialty care and
   expertise to patients with critical time-sensitive conditions.
   Introduction: The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of
   ED-based telemedicine on timeliness of care in participating rural
   hospitals.
   Materials and Methods: Matched cohort study of patients seen in 1 of 14
   rural hospitals in a large Midwestern telemedicine network. Telemedicine
   cases were matched 2: 1 with controls based on age, diagnosis, and
   hospital. The primary outcome was door-to-provider time, and secondary
   outcomes included ED length-of-stay (LOS) and time-to-transfer in those
   transferred to other hospitals.
   Results: Of 127,928 qualifying ED encounters, 2,857 consulted
   telemedicine and were matched with nontelemedicine controls.
   Door-to-provider time was shorter in telemedicine patients by 6.0min
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 4.3-7.8 min). The first provider seeing
   the patient was a telemedicine provider in 41.7\% of telemedicine
   encounters, and in these cases, telemedicine was 14.7min earlier than
   local providers. ED LOS was 22.1 min shorter (95\% CI 3.1-41.2) among
   transferred patients, but total ED LOS was longer (40.2min, 95\% CI
   30.8-49.6 min) for all telemedicine patients.
   Conclusions: Telemedicine decreases ED door-to-provider time, most
   commonly because the telemedicine provider was the first provider seeing
   a patient. Among transferred patients, ED LOS at the first hospital was
   shorter in patients who had telemedicine consulted. Future work will
   focus on the clinical impact of more timely rural ED care.}},

Title = {{A Study of Users with Suicidal Ideation on Sina Weibo}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death in China, and so suicide
   intervention on social media is an important issue in the field of
   public health. Sina Weibo (Weibo) is an emerging surveillance tool that
   may provide online assistance for users at the risk of suicide.
   Materials and Methods: Keyword-based methods and supervised classifiers
   were employed to conduct this research. A control group was established
   to explore the differences between Weibo users with suicidal ideation
   (USI) and the general population.
   Results: A total of 114 USI were detected from 1 million active Weibo
   users. By studying the negative postings of these USI, disclosure of the
   reasons for their bad moods was the most common theme. The emotions of
   USI tend to be particularly down between 05: 00 pm and midnight. Use of
   the first-person pronoun by Weibo USI is significantly frequent.
   Conclusions: Our findings may help to identify individuals with suicidal
   ideation who are not identified by the traditional clinical approach.
   Consequently, detecting and helping individuals who may be at risk of
   committing suicide may become more efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Background: While prevalent in everyday life, smartphones are also
   finding increasing use as a medical care adjunct. The use of smartphone
   technology as a postoperative cosmetic surgery adjunct for care has
   received little attention in the literature.
   Objectives: The purpose of this effort was to assess the potential
   efficacy of a smartphone-based cosmetic surgery early postoperative
   follow-up program. Specifically, could smartphone photography provided
   by the patient to the plastic surgeon in the first few days after
   surgery allay patient's concerns, improve the postoperative experience
   and, possibly, detect early complications?
   Methods: From August 2015 to March 2016 a smartphone-based postoperative
   protocol was established for patients undergoing cosmetic procedures. At
   the time of discharge, the plastic surgeon sent a text to the patient
   with instructions for the patient to forward a postoperative photograph
   of the operated area within 48 to 72 hours. The plastic surgeon then
   made a return call/text that same day to review the patient's progress.
   A postoperative questionnaire evaluated the patients' postoperative
   experience and satisfaction with the program.
   Results: A total of 57 patients were included in the study. Fifty-two
   patients responded to the survey. A total of 50 (96.2\%) patients
   reported that the process improved the quality of their postoperative
   experience. The protocol allowed to detect early complications in 3
   cases. The physician was able to address and treat the complications the
   following day prior to the scheduled clinic follow up.
   Conclusions: The smartphone can be effectively utilized by the surgeon
   to both enhance the patient's postoperative experience and alert the
   surgeon to early postoperative problems.}},

Title = {{Internet Village Motoman Project in rural Cambodia: bridging the digital
   divide}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& PEOPLE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{2-20}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Community wireless networking has become a growing trend in
   both metropolitan and rural areas around the world. However, few studies
   have sought to understand what motivates people to use community
   wireless networks and the unintended effects that those technologies
   have on communities, particularly for rural users. The purpose of this
   paper is to explore the benefits and usage of an asynchronous wireless
   internet system in a rural village of Cambodia to examine the issues and
   challenges in the acceptance of a new technology in a less-developed
   country.
   Design/methodology/approach - By employing qualitative methods of
   in-depth case analysis, the authors revealed various usage motivations
   and unintended effects of the system.
   Findings - The authors identified five reasons that motivated users to
   use the system: avowed identity, a means to an end, maintaining personal
   ties, power and influence, and psychological commitment and ownership.
   The unintended effects of the system included increased number of
   interactions among actors and other uses of the system, including
   internet commerce, telemedicine, and e-government.
   Research limitations/implications - This study explores the wireless
   internet project known as the ``Internet Village Motoman Project{''}
   that was initiated by a non-governmental organization with funding from
   private donors, supplemented with matching funds from the Asian
   Development Bank and the World Bank.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the academic understanding
   of rural regions of Cambodia and its evidence supports the current
   theoretical assumptions that user behaviors are not determined only by
   users' decisions alone (as proposed by traditional cognitive IS
   research), but also by users and their social interactions as stated in
   the four-dimensional social actor framework proposed by Lamb and Kling
   (2003). The latter provides better explanation of the motivation for
   internet use in the region. The theoretical contribution of this study
   is the useful adoption of the actor-network approach in a
   non-organizational setting. The findings also contribute to the
   literature on how practical internet engineering can bridge the digital
   divide. Fulfilling the needs identified in the research and
   understanding unintended effects of the system will contribute to the
   successful implementation of new internet projects in other rural areas.}},

   trial: Study design and sample characteristics}},
Journal = {{CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{64}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pain is the most common presenting somatic symptom in
   medical outpatients, and depression and anxiety are the two most common
   mental disorders. They frequently co-occur, are under-treated, and
   result in substantial disability and reduced health-related quality of
   life.
   Objectives: The Comprehensive vs. Assisted Management of Mood and Pain
   Symptoms (CAMMPS) study is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial
   designed to test the relative effectiveness of a lower-resource vs. a
   higher-resource technology-assisted intervention for the management of
   patients suffering from pain plus anxiety and/or depression.
   Methods/design: CAMMPS has enrolled 294 primary care patients with
   chronic pain plus comorbid anxiety and/or depression and randomized them
   to either: 1) Assisted Symptom Management (ASM) consisting of automated
   symptom monitoring by interactive voice recording or Internet and
   prompted pain and mood self-management; or 2) Comprehensive Symptom
   Management (CSM) which combines ASM with optimized medication management
   delivered by a nurse-physician specialist team and facilitated mental
   health care. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
   The primary outcome is a composite pain-anxiety-depression (PAD)
   severity score. Secondary outcomes include individual pain, anxiety, and
   depression scores, health-related quality of life, disability,
   healthcare utilization, and treatment satisfaction.
   Discussion: CAMMPS provides an integrated approach to PAD symptoms
   rather than fragmented care of single symptoms; coordinated symptom
   management in partnership with primary care clinicians and psychologists
   embedded in primary care; efficient use of health information
   technology; attention to physical and psychological symptom comorbidity;
   and the coupling of self-management with optimized medication management
   and facilitated mental health care.}},

Title = {{Remote Collaborative Depression Care Program for Adolescents in
   Araucania Region, Chile: Randomized Controlled Trial}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite evidence on efficacious interventions, a great
   proportion of depressed adolescents do not receive evidence-based
   treatment and have no access to specialized mental health care. Remote
   collaborative depression care (RCDC) may help to reduce the gap between
   needs and specialized mental health services.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility,
   acceptability, and effectiveness of an RCDC intervention for adolescents
   with major depressive disorder (MDD) living in the Araucania Region,
   Chile.
   Methods: A cluster randomized, assessor-blind trial was carried out at
   16 primary care centers in the Araucania Region, Chile. Before
   randomization, all participating primary care teams were trained in
   clinical guidelines for the treatment of adolescent depression.
   Adolescents (N=143; 13-19 years) with MDD were recruited. The
   intervention group (RCDC, N=65) received a 3-month RCDC treatment that
   included continuous remote supervision by psychiatrists located in
   Santiago, Chile's capital city, through shared electronic health records
   (SEHR) and phone patient monitoring. The control group (enhanced usual
   care or EUC; N=78) received EUC by clinicians who were encouraged to
   follow clinical guidelines. Recruitment and response rates and the use
   of the SEHR system were registered; patient adherence and satisfaction
   with the treatment and clinician satisfaction with RCDC were assessed at
   12-week follow-up; and depressive symptoms and health-related quality of
   life (HRQoL) were evaluated at baseline and 12-weeks follow-up.
   Results: More than 60.3\% (143/237) of the original estimated sample
   size was recruited, and a response rate of 90.9\% (130/143) was achieved
   at 12-week follow-up. A mean (SD) of 3.5 (4.0) messages per patient were
   written on the SEHR system by primary care teams. A third of the
   patients showed an optimal adherence to psychopharmacological treatment,
   and adolescents in the RCDC intervention group were more satisfied with
   psychological assistance than those in EUC group. Primary care
   clinicians were satisfied with the RCDC intervention, valuing its
   usefulness. There were no significant differences in depressive symptoms
   or HRQoL between groups. Satisfaction with psychological care, in both
   groups, was related to a significant change in depressive symptomatology
   at 12-weeks follow-up (beta=-4.3, 95\% CI -7.2 to -1.3).
   Conclusions: This is the first trial of its kind in Latin America that
   includes adolescents from vulnerable backgrounds, with an intervention
   that proved to be feasible and well accepted by both patients and
   primary care clinicians. Design and implementation issues may explain
   similar effectiveness across arms. The effectiveness of the intervention
   seems to be comparable with an already nationwide established treatment
   program that proved to be highly efficacious under controlled
   conditions.}},

Title = {{Effect of Contract Compliance Rate to a Fourth-Generation Telehealth
   Program on the Risk of Hospitalization in Patients With Chronic Kidney
   Disease: Retrospective Cohort Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in Taiwan and it
   is associated with high all-cause mortality. We have shown in a previous
   paper that a fourth-generation telehealth program is associated with
   lower all-cause mortality compared to usual care with a hazard ratio of
   0.866 (95\% CI 0.837-0.896).
   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of renal function
   status on hospitalization among patients receiving this program and to
   evaluate the relationship between contract compliance rate to the
   program and risk of hospitalization in patients with CKD.
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 715 patients receiving the
   telehealth care program. Contract compliance rate was defined as the
   percentage of days covered by the telehealth service before
   hospitalization. Patients were stratified into three groups according to
   renal function status: (1) normal renal function, (2) CKD, or (3)
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and on maintenance dialysis. The outcome
   measurements were first cardiovascular and all-cause hospitalizations.
   The association between contract compliance rate, renal function status,
   and hospitalization risk was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards
   model with time-dependent covariates.
   Results: The median follow-up duration was 694 days (IQR 338-1163).
   Contract compliance rate had a triphasic relationship with
   cardiovascular and all-cause hospitalizations. Patients with low or very
   high contract compliance rates were associated with a higher risk of
   hospitalization. Patients with CKD or ESRD were also associated with a
   higher risk of hospitalization. Moreover, we observed a significant
   interaction between the effects of renal function status and contract
   compliance rate on the risk of hospitalization: patients with ESRD, who
   were on dialysis, had an increased risk of hospitalization at a lower
   contract compliance rate, compared with patients with normal renal
   function or CKD.
   Conclusions: Our study showed that there was a triphasic relationship
   between contract compliance rate to the telehealth program and risk of
   hospitalization. Renal function status was associated with risk of
   hospitalization among these patients, and there was a significant
   interaction with contract compliance rate.}},

Title = {{eHealth Technologies, Multimorbidity, and the Office Visit: Qualitative
   Interview Study on the Perspectives of Physicians and Nurses}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: eHealth is a broad term referring to the application of
   information and communication technologies in the health sector, ranging
   from health records to telemedicine and multiple forms of health
   education and digital tools. By providing increased and anytime access
   to information, opportunities to exchange experiences with others, and
   self-management support, eHealth has been heralded as transformational.
   It has created a group of informed, engaged, and empowered patients as
   partners, equipped to take part in shared decision making and
   effectively self-manage chronic illness. Less attention has been given
   to health care professionals' (HCPs) experiences of the role of eHealth
   in patient encounters.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to examine HCPs' perspectives
   on how eHealth affects their relationships with patients living with
   multiple chronic conditions, as well as its ethical and practical
   ramifications.
   Methods: We interviewed HCPs about their experiences with eHealth and
   its impact on the office visit. Eligible participants needed to report a
   caseload of >= 25\% of patients with multimorbidity to address issues of
   managing complex chronic conditions and coordination of care. We used a
   semistructured discussion guide for in-depth interviews, and follow-up
   interviews served to clarify and expand upon initial discussions.
   Constant comparisons and a narrative approach guided the analyses, and a
   relational ethics conceptual lens was applied to the data to identify
   emergent themes.
   Results: A total of 12 physicians and nurses (6 male, 6 female; median
   years of practice >= 13) participated. eHealth tools most frequently
   described were Web-based educational resources for patients and
   Web-based resources for HCPs such as curated scientific summaries on
   diagnostic criteria, clinical therapies, and dosage calculators.
   Analysis centered on a grand theme of the two-way conversation between
   HCPs and patients, which addresses a general recentering of the ethical
   relationship between HCPs and patients around engagement. Subthemes
   explain the evolution of the two-way conversation, and having, using,
   and supporting the two-way conversation with patients, primarily as this
   relates to achieving adherence and health outcomes.
   Conclusions: Emerging ethical concerns were related to the ambiguity of
   the ideal of empowered patients and the ways in which health
   professionals described enacting those ideals in practice, showing how
   the cultural shift toward truly mutually respectful and collaborative
   practice is in transition. HCPs aim to act in the best interests of
   their patients; the challenge is to benefit from emergent technologies
   that may enhance patient-HCP interactions and effective care, while
   abiding by regulations, dealing with the strictures of the technology
   itself, and managing changing demands on their time.}},

Title = {{Telemedicine in the Management of Type 1 Diabetes}},
Journal = {{PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Veterans with type 1 diabetes who live in rural Alabama and Georgia face
   barriers to receiving specialty diabetes care because of a lack of
   endocrinologists in the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System.
   Telemedicine is a promising solution to help increase access to needed
   health care. We evaluated telemedicine's effectiveness in delivering
   endocrinology care from Atlanta-based endocrinologists.
   Methods
   We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who were enrolled
   in the Atlanta VAMC Endocrinology Telehealth Clinic from June 2014 to
   October 2016. Outcomes of interest were hemoglobin A1c levels, changes
   in glycemic control, time savings for patients, cost savings for the US
   Veterans Health Administration, appointment adherence rates, and patient
   satisfaction with telehealth.
   Results
   Thirty-two patients with type 1 diabetes received telehealth care and in
   general received the recommended processes of diabetes care. Patients
   trended toward a decrease in mean hemoglobin A1c and glucose variability
   and a nonsignificant increase in hypoglycemic episodes. Patients saved
   78 minutes of travel time (one way), and the VA saved \$72.94 in travel
   reimbursements per patient visit. Patients adhered to 88\% of scheduled
   telehealth appointments on average, and 100\% of surveyed patients
   stated they would recommend telehealth to other veterans.
   Conclusions
   Specialty diabetes care delivered via telemedicine was safe and was
   associated with time savings, cost savings, high appointment adherence
   rates, and high patient satisfaction. Our findings support growing
   evidence that telemedicine is an effective alternative method of health
   care delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the association of physical activity (PA) and
   sedentary behaviour with diabetic retinopathy (DR) in type 2 diabetes
   adults.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study of adults with type 2
   diabetes. DR was assessed from disc- and macula-centred fundus
   photograph, and categorised into mild, moderate non-proliferative DR
   (NPDR), and Vision-Threatening DR (VTDR). Worse eye was used to
   determine the person's DR severity. PA was assessed using WHO Global
   Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). All of the PA components,
   including daily sitting time, walking distance, sleeping duration, and
   exercise were converted based on the physical activity ratio and then
   calculated to obtain the mean physical activity level (PAL). The mean
   PAL was then classified into sedentary, moderate, and vigorous
   lifestyle.
   Results: There were 1116 participants, 43.1\% with any DR and 26.3\%
   VTDR. The prevalence of DR/VTDR in sedentary, moderate, and vigorous
   physical activity group was 41.9\%/22.7\%, 39.2\%/23.9\%, and
   32.7\%/20.4\% respectively. A longer duration of daily sedentary
   lifestyle (>3 hours) was significantly associated with presence of DR
   (OR 1.66; 95\% CI 1.17-2.35; p < 0.01) and VTDR (OR 1.74; 1.16-2.62; p <
   0.01). These associations remained significant after adjusting for age,
   gender, duration of diabetes, systolic blood pressure and physical
   activity. There was no significant association between sleeping
   duration, walking distance, and vigorous activity and DR.
   Conclusions: In this study, prolonged daily sedentary activity was
   strongly associated with VTDR. This finding suggests that public health
   campaign for reducing daily sedentary activities in individuals with
   type 2 diabetes may offer benefit to reduce the burden of DR and VTDR.}},

   Methods: ROP screening via indirect ophthalmoscopy followed by RetCam
   imaging was performed from 2014 to 2015. Three ROP-experienced
   ophthalmologists interpreted images remotely. Incidence of ROP was
   determined by combining bedside and telemedicine diagnoses.
   Results: Of 139 examined infants and 137 complete records, 20 (14.6\%)
   patients developed ROP, with 11 (8.0\%) stage 1, six (4.4\%) stage 2,
   and three (2.2\%) stage 3 based on combined diagnoses. Perinatal
   asphyxia was significantly associated with ROP incidence (p = 0.01). ROP
   incidence by combined diagnosis (20/137 or 14.6\%) versus clinician
   diagnosis alone (21/137 or 15.3\%, p = 0.50) was similar. Telemedicine
   changed diagnoses in 4/21 (19.0\%) ROP cases.
   Conclusions: Telemedicine may be helpful in confirming ROP incidence and
   may serve as a training and support model for less experienced and
   professionally isolated ROP examiners.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: RNs are adopting an ever-larger role in health care models
   designed to reduce costs, increase patient satisfaction, and improve
   patient outcomes. Most research exploring such models has focused on
   those involving physicians or advanced practice nurses rather than RNs.
   This study explored the perspectives of patients, RNs, and other
   providers regarding a new prenatal connected care model for low-risk
   patients aimed at reducing in-office visits and creating virtual
   patient-RN connections. Methods: This qualitative evaluation was
   performed as part of a larger randomized controlled trial of the new
   care model. Individual interviews and asynchronous online focus groups
   were conducted with a total of 41 patients, up to 10 unit and connected
   care RNs, and up to 17 other providers (up to eight physicians and nine
   certified nurse midwives {[} CNMs]). Results: Thematic analysis
   indicated that patients in the new care model valued connectedness and
   relationships with the connected care RNs, including the ability to
   contact them as needed outside the office setting. Patients also valued
   their relationships with physicians and CNMs. Physicians appreciated
   having more time to care for higher-risk patients, and the connected
   care RNs appreciated being able to work to a fuller scope of practice,
   although participants in all provider groups suggested the increased use
   of protocols and other systems to ensure patient safety and improve
   communication among providers. Conclusions: A prenatal connected care
   model for low-risk women allowed patients to decrease the number of
   scheduled in-person clinic visits with physicians or CNMs while building
   stronger nurse-patient relationships through virtual connected care
   visits with an RN. The results included increased patient satisfaction
   and greater autonomy for RNs, allowing them to work to a fuller scope of
   practice. Although the new model gave physicians more time in which to
   see higher-risk patients, CNM-patient relationships may have been
   limited.}},

   PubMed papers were reviewed, of which 74 were assessed.Expert
   commentary: Papers showed that evidence regarding telemedicine solutions
   is mostly conflictive. Simple SMS reminders might work for patients who
   do not take their medication because of forgetfulness. Educational
   interventions and coaching interventions, primarily delivered by
   telephone or via a web-based platform can be effective tools to enhance
   medication adherence. Finally, it should be noted that current
   developments in software engineering may dramatically change the way
   non-adherence is addressed in the nearby future.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses endovascular thrombectomy in acute ischemic
   stroke. This treatment is vascular medicine's most significant leap in
   years. This treatment is complicated, and various technical aspects are
   discussed. Close cooperation is required between different specialties
   since patient selection for treatment is complex. Interventionists need
   close collaboration with stroke neurologists. Government needs to be
   involved as this treatment mandates structural changes which will incur
   more manpower and financial resources. Telemedicine is also discussed as
   it has been shown to be advantageous for augmenting thrombolytic
   administration for acute ischemic stroke. Due to technical advances, it
   has been easier to provide such service, but hurdles need to be resolved
   so it can be fully implemented. It is likely that telemedicine will also
   play a role in thrombectomy. This article proposes how thrombectomy
   could be delivered in Iceland. It will prove difficult to provide such
   complex treatment in a scattered population of 343.000 people where
   expertise is limited to one or two sites. It is important to remember,
   that coronary intervention was a formidable challenge at one time, but
   it was accomplished. Can we learn from that experience?}},

Abstract = {{Background: Telemonitoring can improve heart failure (HF) management,
   but there is no standardized evaluation framework to comprehensively
   evaluate its impact.
   Objective: Our objectives were to list the criteria used in published
   evaluations of noninvasive HF telemonitoring projects, describe how they
   are used in the evaluation studies, and organize them into a consistent
   scheme.
   Methods: Articles published from January 1990 to August 2015 were
   obtained through MEDLINE, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Articles were
   eligible if they were original reports of a noninvasive HF
   telemonitoring evaluation study in the English language. Studies of
   implantable telemonitoring devices were excluded. Each selected article
   was screened to extract the description of the telemonitoring project
   and the evaluation process and criteria. A qualitative synthesis was
   performed.
   Results: We identified and reviewed 128 articles leading to 52
   evaluation criteria classified into 6 dimensions: clinical, economic,
   user perspective, educational, organizational, and technical. The
   clinical and economic impacts were evaluated in more than 70\% of
   studies, whereas the educational, organizational, and technical impacts
   were studied in fewer than 15\%. User perspective was the most
   frequently covered dimension in the development phase of telemonitoring
   projects, whereas clinical and economic impacts were the focus of later
   phases.
   Conclusions: Telemonitoring evaluation frameworks should cover all 6
   dimensions appropriately distributed along the telemonitoring project
   lifecycle. Our next goal is to build such a comprehensive evaluation
   framework for telemonitoring and test it on an ongoing noninvasive HF
   telemonitoring project.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Community-based strategies to test for HIV, hepatitis B
   virus (HBV), and sickle cell disease (SCD) have expanded opportunities
   to increase the proportion of pregnant women who are aware of their
   diagnosis. In order to use this information to implement evidence-based
   interventions, these results have to be available to skilled health
   providers at the point of delivery. Most electronic health platforms are
   dependent on the availability of reliable Internet connectivity and,
   thus, have limited use in many rural and resource-limited settings.
   Objective: Here we describe our work on the development and deployment
   of an integrated mHealth platform that is able to capture medical
   information, including test results, and encrypt it into a patient-held
   smartcard that can be read at the point of delivery without the need for
   an Internet connection.
   Methods: We engaged a team of implementation scientists, public health
   experts, and information technology specialists in a
   requirement-gathering process to inform the design of a prototype for a
   platform that uses smartcard technology, database deployment, and mobile
   phone app development. Key design decisions focused on usability,
   scalability, and security.
   Results: We successfully designed an integrated mHealth platform and
   deployed it in 4 health facilities across Benue State, Nigeria. We
   developed the Vitira Health platform to store test results of HIV, HBV,
   and SCD in a database, and securely encrypt the results on a Quick
   Response code embedded on a smartcard. We used a mobile app to read the
   contents on the smartcard without the need for Internet connectivity.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that it is possible to develop a
   patient-held smartcard and an mHealth platform that contains vital
   health information that can be read at the point of delivery using a
   mobile phone-based app without an Internet connection.}},

Abstract = {{Background: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic
   heart failure (CHF) frequently coexist in older people, reducing
   patients' quality of life (QoL) and increasing morbidity and mortality.
   Objective: we studied the feasibility and efficacy of an integrated
   telerehabilitation home-based programme (Telereab-HBP), 4 months long,
   in patients with combined COPD and CHF. The primary outcome was exercise
   tolerance evaluated at the 6-min walk test (6MWT). Secondary outcomes
   were time-to-event (hospitalisation and death), dyspnoea (MRC), physical
   activity profile (PASE), disability (Barthel) and QoL (MLHFQ and CAT).
   Study design: randomised, open, controlled, multicenter trial.
   Methods: the Telereab-HBP included remote monitoring of
   cardiorespiratory parameters, weekly phone-calls by the nurse, and
   exercise programme, monitored weekly by the physiotherapist. All
   outcomes were studied again after 2 months of a no-intervention period.
   Results: in total, 112 patients were randomised, 56 per group. Their
   mean (SD) age was 70 (9) years, and 92 (82.1\%) were male. After 4
   months, the IG were able to walk further than at baseline: mean (95\%
   CI).6MWT was 60 (22.2,97.8) m; the CG showed no significant improvement:
   -15 (-40.3,9.8) m; P = 0.0040 between groups. In IG, the media time to
   hospitalisation/death was 113.4 days compared with 104.7 in the CG (P =
   0.0484, log-rank test). Other secondary outcomes: MRC (P = 0.0500), PASE
   (P = 0.0015), Barthel (P = 0.0006), MLHFQ (P = 0.0007) and CAT (P =
   0.0000) were significantly improved in the IG compared with the CG at 4
   months. IG maintained the benefits acquired at 6 months for outcomes.
   Conclusions: this 4-month Telereab-HBP was feasible and effective in
   older patients with combined COPD and CHF.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine correlations between height
   and weight with mandibular cortical width (MCW) that may aid
   identification of bone mineral density (BMD) in a pediatric population.
   A total of 122 patients (69 boys and 53 girls) aged 4 to 6 years old who
   were patients at the Dental Hospital of Faculty of Dentistry (UHS, Lao
   P.D.R.) participated in the study. Anthropometric data of height and
   weight were recorded. Digital panoramic radiographs were taken and
   transferred to Nihon University, Tokyo via telemedicine system. MCW was
   measured using a SDS-DICOM viewer application. The Mann-Whitney U test
   was performed to analyze MCW gender differences. Tukey - Kramer method
   was performed to determine means of MCW, Height, Weight between each age
   group. The Pearson's correlation test was performed to analyze the
   correlation between MCW and Height or Weight. P values less than 0.05
   were considered statistically significant. The range of MCW were between
   1.40-3.03 mm in males and 1.68-2.80 mm in females, with no sexual
   differences. As age increased, each parameter (MCW, Height, Weight)
   increased, but no significant difference between age groups was detected
   in MCW. There were positive significant correlations between height and
   MCW, but not between weight and MCW. This pilot study has shown that MCW
   does not appear to be a useful indicator for the diagnosis of hidden
   children osteogenesis. Further studies are needed to examine if other
   panoramic radiomorphometric indices could be more relevant.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose:The accessibility of ophthalmologists appears to influence the
   quality of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR). The principal
   objective of this study was to analyze the effect of automobile travel
   time to the closest ophthalmologist on the time to DR
   screening.Methods:This historical cohort study used reimbursement
   databases from the principal national health insurance fund. Patients
   were included if they had been reimbursed at least thrice for oral
   antidiabetic medications in the 12 months before the study start date.
   Patients were followed up from January 1, 2008, for 4 years. The
   expected event was a DR screening by an ocular fundus examination. The
   automobile travel time to the nearest ophthalmologist was calculated by
   the distance between communes, estimated by appropriate software. A
   Kaplan-Meier curve and a multivariate Cox model were used to model the
   effect of travel time on the time until DR screening. A sensitivity
   analysis of travel time described the results of the Cox
   model.Results:At the start of 2008, 6,573 patients living in 328
   different municipalities were included. The multivariate model found
   that patients living 60min or more away from an ophthalmologist had a
   lower instantaneous probability of DR screening than those living <30min
   away (adjusted risk ratio=0.82; 95\% confidence interval 0.71-0.95;
   p=0.009). The sensitivity analysis showed that this difference became
   significant at 35min of travel time.Conclusion:Increased automobile
   travel time for patients with diabetes to the nearest ophthalmologist
   was associated with a longer time to DR screening.}},

Abstract = {{Background:Telemedicine in the intensive care unit (tele-ICU) is
   expected to address geographic health disparities through more efficient
   resource allocation. Our previous economic evaluation demonstrated
   tele-ICU to be cost-effective in most cases and cost saving in some
   cases, compared to conventional intensive care unit (ICU) care without
   adequate intensivist coverage.Introduction:This study's objective is to
   examine how to optimize the cost-effectiveness of tele-ICU use by
   selecting highest risk (i.e., both highest mortality and highest cost)
   subpopulations. We also explore potential cost savings.Materials and
   Methods:We conducted simulation analyses among a hypothetical adult ICU
   patient cohort defined by the literature, distinguishing four types of
   hospitals: urban tertiary (primary analysis), urban community, rural
   tertiary, and rural community. The selected tele-ICU use was assumed to
   affect per-patient ICU cost and hospital mortality among highest risk
   subpopulations (10-100\% of all ICU patients), defined by an established
   illness-severity measure.Results:We found a U-shaped relationship
   between the economic efficiency and selected tele-ICU use among all 4
   hospital types. Optimal cost-effectiveness was achieved when tele-ICU
   was applied to the 30-40\% highest risk patients among all ICU patients
   (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio=\$25,392 {[}2014 U.S. dollars] per
   extending a quality-adjusted life year) in urban tertiary hospitals
   (primary analysis). Our break-even analyses indicated that cost saving
   seems more feasible when reducing ICU medical care cost, rather than
   lowering the cost to operate telemedicine alone.Discussion and
   Conclusions:A selected use of tele-ICU based on severity of illness is
   likely to improve tele-ICU cost-effectiveness. To achieve cost saving,
   tele-ICU must reduce more than just telemedicine-related cost.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction:The intent was to evaluate time to match initial investment
   of a new, statewide correctional system telehealth program based upon
   cumulative savings by avoidance of transportation and custody-related
   costs.Materials and Methods:The setting was a statewide correctional
   system where prisoners received medical care through enhanced
   telemedicine technology supported by newly recruited specialty providers
   delivered through an open architecture system. The patients were
   incarcerated persons requiring nonemergent consultations in 10
   specialties. A financial model was created to estimate transportation
   expenses, including vehicular use and custody staff, during the out of
   prison travel for traditional face-to-face care. Cost savings were then
   estimated by multiplying transportation expenses by the number of
   telehealth encounters (avoided cost) and summed cumulatively. Savings
   were mapped monthly. Private sector specialists were recruited, provided
   security clearance, trained in the use of the technology, and provided a
   secure site to provide services.Measurements and Main Results:Based on
   the financial model, 1.2 million dollars in savings, equaling the
   initial capital investment, were achieved at 32 months. The total number
   of patient telemedicine encounters increased from 2,365 (98/month) to
   3,748 during the first 32 months of operation (July 2013 through January
   2016: +/- 117/month) with 89\% of the established specialties performed
   by telemedicine technologies.Discussion:It was initially estimated to
   require 48 months to achieve the investment savings, but savings were
   achieved in 32 months, demonstrating greater adoption than expected.
   While finances were quantifiable, enhanced public safety by avoidance of
   out of prison time is unquantifiable, but judged to be significant.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Mobile phone messaging software robots allow clinicians and
   healthcare systems to communicate with patients without the need for
   human intervention. The purpose of this study was to (1) describe a
   method for communicating with patients postoperatively outside of the
   traditional healthcare setting by utilizing an automated software and
   mobile phone messaging platform and to (2) evaluate the first week of
   postoperative pain and opioid use after common ambulatory hand surgery
   procedures. Materials and Methods: The investigation was a prospective,
   multicenter investigation of patient-reported pain and opioid usage
   after ambulatory hand surgery. Inclusion criteria included any adult
   with a mobile phone capable of text messaging, who was undergoing a
   common ambulatory hand surgical procedure at one of three tertiary care
   institutions. Participants received daily, automated text messages
   inquiring about their pain level and how many tablets of prescription
   pain medication they had taken in the past 24h. Initial 1-week response
   rate was assessed and compared between different patient demographics.
   Patient-reported pain and opioid use were also quantified for the first
   postoperative week. Statistical significance was set as p<0.05. Results:
   Forty-seven (n=47) patients were enrolled in this investigation. Total
   response rate of both pain and opioid medication questions through 7
   days was 88.3\%. Pain trended down on a daily basis for the first
   postoperative week, with the highest levels of pain being reported in
   the first 48h after surgery. Patients reported an average use of
   15.914.8 tablets of prescription opioid pain medication. Conclusions: We
   find that a mobile phone messaging software robot allows for effective
   data collection of postoperative pain and pain medication use. Patients
   undergoing common ambulatory hand procedures utilized an average of 16
   tablets of opioid medication in the first postoperative week.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a pilot telehealth
   program applied to a wide population of patients with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Design:Vital signs data were
   transmitted from the home of the patient on a daily basis using a
   patient monitoring system for review by community nurse to assist
   decisions on management.Setting:Community services for patients
   diagnosed with COPD.Participants:Two Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) enrolled
   321 patients diagnosed with COPD into the telehealth program. Two
   hundred twenty-seven (n=227) patients having a complete baseline record
   of at least 88 days of continuous remote monitoring and meeting all
   inclusion criteria were included in the statistical
   analysis.Intervention:Remote monitoring.Methods:Resource and cost data
   associated with patient events (inpatient hospitalization, accident and
   emergency {[}A\&E], and home visits) 12 months before, immediately
   before and during monitoring, equipment, start-up, and administration
   were collected and compared to determine cost-effectiveness of the
   program.Main Outcome Measures:Cost-effectiveness of program, impact on
   resource usage, and patterns of change in resource
   usage.Results:Cost-effectiveness was determined for the two PCTs and the
   two periods before monitoring to provide four separate estimates.
   Cost-effectiveness had high variance both between the PCTs and between
   the comparison periods ranging from a saving of 140,800 (\$176,000) to
   an increase of 9,600 pound (\$12,000). The average saving was 1,023
   pound (\$1,280) per patient per year. The largest impact was on length
   of stay with a fall in the average length of inpatient care in PCT1 from
   11.5 days in the period 12 months before monitoring to 6.5 days during
   monitoring, and similarly in PCT2 from 7.5 to 5.2 days.Conclusion:There
   was a wide discrepancy in the results from the two PCTs. This places
   doubt on outcomes and may indicate also why the literature on
   cost-effectiveness remains inconclusive. The wide variance on savings
   and the uncertainty of monitoring cost do not allow a definitive
   conclusion on the cost-effectiveness as an outcome of this study. It
   might well be that the average saving was 1,023 pound (\$1,280) per
   patient per year, but the variance is too great to allow this to be
   statistically significant. Each locality-based clinical service provides
   a service to achieve the same clinical goal, but it does so in
   significantly different ways. The introduction of remote monitoring has
   a profound effect on team learning and clinical practice and thus
   distorts the cost-effectiveness evaluation of the use of the technology.
   Cost-effectiveness studies will continue to struggle to provide a
   definitive answer because outcome measurements are too dependent on
   factors other than the technology.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in technology such as telemedicine (TM) have made access to
   cost-effective, quality health care feasible for remote patients. TM is
   especially well suited for patients with chronic disorders such as
   haemophilia and related haemostatic disorders that benefit not only from
   more frequent interaction with care providers at a specialized
   haemophilia treatment center but also from consultations with other
   specialists. Telehealth refers to a broader application of TM and
   includes non-clinical services such as education, provider training,
   administrative meetings etc. Collaboration with the local primary care
   provider for management and implementation is key for successful and
   sustainable TM. This review article provides an overview of types of
   telemedicine, technical aspects, its benefits and challenges and focuses
   on the applicability of this technology to persons with bleeding and
   other blood disorders. Examples of TM strategies, process flow of TM
   clinic and experiences at the authors haemophilia treatment center (HTC)
   setting are shared. In addition, mobile health (mHealth) and electronic
   health (eHealth), both a part of telehealth, and their applications are
   briefly described. Clearly, widespread adoption of this technology will
   not only enhance care of patients but will enable more people,
   especially in underserved areas, to receive specialty care.}},

Title = {{Evaluating barriers to adopting telemedicine worldwide: A systematic
   review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TELEMEDICINE AND TELECARE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{4-12}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction and objective: Studies on telemedicine have shown success
   in reducing the geographical and time obstacles incurred in the receipt
   of care in traditional modalities with the same or greater
   effectiveness; however, there are several barriers that need to be
   addressed in order for telemedicine technology to spread. The aim of
   this review is to evaluate barriers to adopting telemedicine worldwide
   through the analysis of published work.
   Methods: The authors conducted a systematic literature review by
   extracting the data from the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied
   Health Literature (CINAHL) and PubMed (MEDLINE) research databases. The
   reviewers in this study analysed 30 articles (nine from CINAHL and 21
   from Medline) and identified barriers found in the literature. This
   review followed the checklist from Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009. The reviewers
   organized the results into one table and five figures that depict the
   data in different ways, organized by: barrier, country-specific
   barriers, organization-specific barriers, patient-specific barriers, and
   medical-staff and programmer-specific barriers.
   Results: The reviewers identified 33 barriers with a frequency of 100
   occurrences through the 30 articles. The study identified the issues
   with technically challenged staff (11\%), followed by resistance to
   change (8\%), cost (8\%), reimbursement (5\%), age of patient (5\%), and
   level of education of patient (5\%). All other barriers occurred at or
   less than 4\% of the time.
   Discussion and conclusions: Telemedicine is not yet ubiquitous, and
   barriers vary widely. The top barriers are technology-specific and could
   be overcome through training, change-management techniques, and
   alternating delivery by telemedicine and personal patient-to-provider
   interaction. The results of this study identify several barriers that
   could be eliminated by focused policy. Future work should evaluate
   policy to identify which one to lever to maximize the results.}},

Title = {{Determining the cost of implementing and operating a remote patient
   monitoring programme for the elderly with chronic conditions: A
   systematic review of economic evaluations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TELEMEDICINE AND TELECARE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) in conjunction with home
   nursing visits is becoming increasingly popular for the follow-up of
   patients with chronic conditions and evidence exists that it improves
   patients' health outcomes. Current cost data is reported inconsistently
   and often gathered from studies of poor methodological quality, making
   it difficult for decision-makers who consider implementing this service
   in their organizations. This study reviewed the cost of RPM programmes
   targeting elderly patients with chronic conditions.
   Methods: After evaluation against the inclusion and exclusion criteria
   and appraisal against two criteria which are important for economic
   evaluations, data from selected studies were extracted and grouped into
   meaningful cost categories, then adjusted to reflect November 2015 US
   dollars.
   Results: In the 13 selected studies, the newly-created cost category
   `Combined intervention cost' (reflecting equipment purchasing, servicing
   and monitoring cost) for the various RPM programmes ranged from
   US\$275-US\$7963 per patient per year. The three main findings are: (a)
   RPM programme costs have decreased since 2004 due to cheaper technology;
   (b) monitoring a single vital sign is likely to be less costly than
   monitoring multiple vital signs; and (c) programmes targeting
   hypertension or congestive heart failure are less costly than those
   targeting respiratory diseases or multiple conditions.
   Conclusions: This review recommends that future studies present their
   cost data with more granularity, that grouping of costs should be
   minimized and that any assumptions, such as amortization, should be made
   explicit. In addition, studies should compare programmes with similar
   characteristics in terms of type of conditions, number of vital signs
   monitored, etc. for more generalizable results.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Telepsychiatric modalities are used widely in the
   treatment of many mental illnesses. It has also been proposed that
   telepsychiatric modalities could be a way to reduce readmissions. The
   purpose of the study was to conduct a systematic review of the
   literature on the effects of telepsychiatric modalities on readmissions
   in psychiatric settings.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, CINAHL,
   Embase, Cochrane, PsycINFO and Joanna Briggs databases in October 2015.
   Inclusion criteria were (a) patients with a psychiatric diagnosis, (b)
   telepsychiatric interventions and (c) an outcome related to readmission.
   Results: The database search identified 218 potential studies, of which
   eight were eligible for the review. Studies were of varying quality and
   there was a tendency towards low-quality studies (five studies) which
   found positive outcomes regarding readmission, whereas the more
   methodological sound studies (three studies) found no effect of
   telepsychiatric modalities on readmission rates.
   Discussion: Previous studies have proven the effectiveness of
   telepsychiatric modalities in the treatment of various mental illnesses.
   However, in the present systematic review we were unable to find an
   effect of telepsychiatric modalities on the rate of readmission. Some
   studies found a reduced rate of readmissions, but the poor
   methodological quality make the findings questionable. At the present
   time there is no evidence to support the use of telepsychiatry due to
   heterogeneous interventions, heterogeneous patient groups and lack of
   high-quality studies.}},

Title = {{Is telemonitoring useful for supporting persons with consciousness

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Preliminary evidences showed that telemedicine may allow a
   reduction of costs and an enhancement of patients' satisfaction and
   quality of life (QoL), with the same effectiveness of conventional
   methods of healthcare delivery. Literature is quite absent in relation
   to the use of telemedicine for patients with disorders of consciousness
   (DoC) whose management is delegated almost entirely to the family. In
   order to promote an alternative setting to manage persons affected by
   DoC, also supporting their families, a pilot project was designed to
   test the feasibility of home-care assistance based on a system of
   telemonitoring.
   Methods: In total, 11 patients were supported by a telemonitoring system
   via a workstation installed at the patients' homes. All patients
   underwent a clinical and functional evaluation at enrolment, after two
   months, after six months and at the end of the project, after 12 months
   by means of clinical scales (Glasgow Coma Scale, Rancho Los Amigos
   Levels of Cognitive Functioning Scale, Glasgow Outcome Scale, Disability
   Rating Scale), while the World Health Organization (WHO) QoL, the
   Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and
   a satisfaction score were completed by caregivers.
   Results: Patients' scores at the clinical scales did not show
   statistically significant differences from T0 to T3. A trend toward the
   improvement of caregivers' QoL, anxiety and depression, as well as a
   high degree of satisfaction with regard to the intervention, were
   reported. The economic evaluation showed an average cost/day for a
   patient of about (Sic)70.
   Discussion: Preliminary data suggest that the use of telemonitoring
   services in the management of persons affected by DoC is feasible and
   well accepted by caregivers, with a potential positive effect on their
   mood and QoL. Therefore, telemonitoring should be considered in the
   management of DoC patients to favour discharge from acute care and to
   support families in home care.}},

   healthcare delivery to underserved populations. However, there are
   challenges including wide variations in the rules, regulations, and
   practice guidelines surrounding telehealth. Nurse practitioners should
   implement practical advice and tips for utilizing telehealth, as well as
   risk management strategies to ensure better patient care and avoid
   malpractice litigation or licensing issues.}},

Abstract = {{Telehealth literature has grown over the years to be a substantial body
   of work. However, research still highlights problems in extracting value
   from telehealth activities. In this paper, we analyse the telehealth
   literature over the period 2000-2015. The methodology focuses on
   paradoxes or surprises in the findings. We explain the lack of an
   operating model for telehealth as a debilitating feature of its history.
   We also note that many of the barriers cited in the literature have not
   changed over the period. We call for a focused research agenda on
   telehealth that provides clear evidence for some of the benefits such as
   cost savings and patient benefits. If telehealth activities are to
   progress, fundamental issues need to be addressed both in research and
   practice. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Potentially avoidable hospitalizations (PAHs) of skilled nursing
   facility (SNF) patients are common and costly. Telemedicine represents a
   unique approach to manage and potentially reduce PAHs in SNFs, having
   been used in a variety of settings to improve coordination of care and
   enhance access to providers. Nonetheless, broad implementation and use
   of telemedicine lags in SNFs relative to other health care settings. To
   understand why, we surveyed SNF administrative staff attending a 1-day
   telemedicine summit. Participants saw the highest value of telemedicine
   in improving the quality of care and reducing readmissions. They
   identified hospital and managed care telemedicine requirements as
   primary drivers of adoption. The most significant barrier to adoption
   was the initial investment required. A joint research-policy effort to
   improve the evidence base around telemedicine in SNFs and introduce
   incentives may improve adoption and continued use of telemedicine in
   this setting.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEIn acute stroke, thromboembolism or spontaneous
   hemorrhage abruptly reduces blood flow to a part of the brain. To limit
   necrosis, rapid radiological identification of the pathological
   mechanism must be conducted to allow the initiation of targeted
   treatment. The aim of the Norwegian Acute Stroke Prehospital Project is
   to determine if anesthesiologists, trained in prehospital critical care,
   may accurately assess cerebral computed tomography (CT) scans in a
   mobile stroke unit (MSU).
   METHODSIn this pilot study, 13 anesthesiologists assessed unselected
   acute stroke patients with a cerebral CT scan in an MSU. The scans were
   simultaneously available by teleradiology at the receiving hospital and
   the on-call radiologist. CT scan interpretation was focused on the
   radiological diagnosis of acute stroke and contraindications for
   thrombolysis. The aim of this study was to find inter-rater agreement
   between the pre- and in-hospital radiological assessments.
   Aneuroradiologist evaluated all CT scans retrospectively. Statistical
   analysis of inter-rater agreement was analyzed with Cohen's kappa.
   RESULTSFifty-one cerebral CT scans from the MSU were included.
   Inter-rater agreement between prehospital anesthesiologists and the
   in-hospital on-call radiologists was excellent in finding radiological
   selection for thrombolysis (kappa .87). Prehospital CT scans were
   conducted in median 10 minutes (7 and 14 minutes) in the MSU, and median
   39 minutes (31 and 48 minutes) before arrival at the receiving hospital.
   CONCLUSIONThis pilot study shows that anesthesiologists trained in
   prehospital critical care may effectively assess cerebral CT scans in an
   MSU, and determine if there are radiological contraindications for
   thrombolysis.}},

Abstract = {{Aims and objectivesTo describe the lived experiences of quality of life
   among a group of patients living with chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease who were included in a telemedical intervention after
   hospitalisation for disease exacerbation.
   BackgroundPatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have high
   symptom burden, poor control of symptoms and a need for greater
   requirements in care. Telemedicine can provide benefits for patients
   with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by improving self-management.
   DesignDescriptive phenomenological approach.
   MethodsTen in-depth interviews were conducted with chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease patients participating in a telemedical intervention.
   The collected data were analysed using a descriptive phenomenological
   research method.
   ResultsLiving with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was experienced
   as creating physical and mental limitations of the diseased body and an
   increasing identity as a patient, which led to impaired quality of life.
   Being included in the telemedicine intervention increased accessibility
   to healthcare services and support from telemedicine nurses.
   Self-measurement of health data increased participants' clinical insight
   and created a mutual clinical language in dialogue with telemedicine
   nurses, which led to increased quality of life. However, receiving care
   through telemedicine was also experienced as a dual chore.
   ConclusionsTelemedicine can reduce the perceived limitations imposed by
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease through four key elements: (i)
   improving accessibility to healthcare services, (ii) increasing support
   from health professionals, (iii) strengthening clinical insight and (iv)
   developing a mutual clinical language, thus increasing quality of life.
   The transparency facilitated through telemedicine in this healthcare
   context encourages open decision-making, where the participants can
   increase their knowledge and improve acknowledgement of and
   collaboration with telemedicine nurses.
   Relevance to clinical practiceTelemedicine can be beneficial when
   rethinking care for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by providing
   knowledge on how living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can
   affect the experience of receiving care through telemedicine and further
   determine for whom telemedicine is useful.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To evaluate the proportion of otolaryngology-head and neck
   surgery (OHNS) providers who are rural versus urban based from 2002 to
   2013. Secondary objective was to present perspectives of rural primary
   care providers on unmet needs for OHNS services.
   Study Design Mixed methods database analysis and prospective survey.
   Setting National administrative database.
   Subjects and Methods The Canadian Medical Association OHNS provider
   Masterfile and the Statistics Canada postal code file were used to
   determine provincial, urban, rural, and Aboriginal group care coverage.
   The Society of Rural Physicians of Canada was surveyed to explore care
   delivery and unmet needs for OHNS and audiology. Descriptive statistics
   and linear regression were used to describe results.
   Results Ontario and Quebec had the largest annual OHNS physician growth
   (6.38 providers/year; r(2) = 0.94) versus stagnant growth in the
   territories. The clear majority of OHNS providers are in urban centers,
   and rural OHNS coverage is decreasing annually (-0.33 providers/year,
   r(2) = 0.28). There are no OHNS providers in 485 population centers
   where Aboriginal groups are located. A survey of 40 rural primary care
   providers reported that OHNS care is most commonly delivered through
   seasonal visits to a local facility, with otology (hearing loss, chronic
   ear disease) and rhinology (nonmalignant nasal or sinus conditions) as
   the most frequently reported unmet needs.
   Conclusion From 2002 to 2013, OHNS coverage showed a trend for urban
   consolidation. Most Aboriginal groups may have decreased access to care,
   as there are no OHNS providers in 485 population centers where reserves
   are located. There is an unmet need for specialized OHNS services
   reported by rural primary care physicians, especially otology and
   rhinology.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Faster treatment with intravenous alteplase in
   acute ischemic stroke is associated with better outcomes. Starting in
   2015, Kaiser Permanente Northern California redesigned its acute stroke
   workflow across all 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California stroke
   centers to (1) follow a single standardized version of a modified
   Helsinki model and (2) have all emergency stroke cases managed by a
   dedicated telestroke neurologist. We examined the effect of Kaiser
   Permanente Northern California's Stroke EXpediting the PRrocess of
   Evaluating and Stopping Stroke program on door-to-needle (DTN) time,
   alteplase use, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates.
   Methods-The program was introduced in a staggered fashion from September
   2015 to January 2016. We compared DTN times for a seasonally adjusted
   9-month period at each center before implementation to the corresponding
   9-month calendar period from the start of implementation. The primary
   outcome was the DTN time for alteplase administration. Secondary
   outcomes included rate of alteplase administrations per month,
   symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and disposition at time of
   discharge.
   Results-This study included 310 patients treated with alteplase in the
   pre-EXpediting the PRrocess of Evaluating and Stopping Stroke period and
   557 patients treated with alteplase in the EXpediting the PRrocess of
   Evaluating and Stopping Stroke period. After implementation, alteplase
   administrations increased to 62/mo from 34/mo at baseline (P<0.001).
   Median DTN time decreased to 34 minutes after implementation from 53.5
   minutes prior (P<0.001), and DTN time of <60 minutes was achieved in
   87.1\% versus 61.0\% (P<0.001) of patients. DTN times <30 minutes were
   much more common in the Stroke EXpediting the PRrocess of Evaluating and
   Stopping Stroke period (40.8\% versus 4.2\% before implementation).
   There was no significant difference in symptomatic intracranial
   hemorrhage rates in the 2 periods (3.8\% versus 2.2\% before
   implementation; P=0.29).
   Conclusions-Introduction of a standardized modified Helsinki protocol
   across 21 hospitals using telestroke management was associated with
   increased alteplase administrations, significantly shorter DTN times,
   and no increase in adverse outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Automated telemedicine interventions could potentially
   improve adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.
   Objectives: Examining the effects of telemedicine-delivered obstructive
   sleep apnea (OSA) education and CPAP telemonitoring with automated
   patient feedback messaging on CPAP adherence.
   Methods: This four-arm, randomized, factorial design clinical trial
   enrolled 1,455 patients (51.0\% women; age, 49.1 +/- 12.5 yr {[}mean +/-
   SD]) referred for suspected OSA. Nine hundred and fifty-six underwent
   home sleep apnea testing, and 556 were prescribed CPAP. Two telemedicine
   interventions were implemented: 1) web-based OSA education (Tel-Ed) and
   2) CPAP telemonitoring with automated patient feedback (Tel-TM).
   Patients were randomized to 1) usual care, 2) Tel-Ed added, 3) Tel-TM
   added, or 4) Tel-Ed and Tel-TM added (Tel-both).
   Measurements and Main Results: The primary endpoint was 90-day CPAP
   usage. Secondary endpoints included attendance to OSA evaluation, and
   change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. CPAP average daily use at 90
   days was 3.8 +/- 2.5, 4.0 +/- 2.4, 4.4 +/- 2.2, and 4.8 +/- 2.3 hours in
   usual care, Tel-Ed, Tel-TM, and Tel-both groups. Usage was significantly
   higher in the Tel-TM and Tel-both groups versus usual care (P = 0.0002
   for both) but not for Tel-Ed (P=0.10). Medicare adherence rates were
   53.5, 61.0, 65.6, and 73.2\% in usual care, Tel-Ed, Tel-TM, and Tel-both
   groups (Tel-both vs. usual care, P = 0.001; Tel-TM vs. usual care, P =
   0.003; Tel-Ed vs. usual care, P = 0.07), respectively. Telemedicine
   education improved clinic attendance compared with no telemedicine
   education (show rate, 68.5 vs. 62.7\%; P = 0.02).
   Conclusions: The use of CPAP telemonitoring with automated feedback
   messaging improved 90-day adherence in patients with OSA.
   Telemedicine-based education did not significantly improve CPAP
   adherence but did increase clinic attendance for OSA evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has recently
   implemented video-to-home (V2H) telehealth as part of a strategy to
   improve access to mental health treatment. Implementation research of
   this modality is needed, given that V2H telehealth transforms the
   traditional face-to-face delivery of mental health services. To address
   this need, V2H implementation was evaluated by examining barriers and
   facilitators that were associated with level of staff V2H experience and
   factors that differentiated facilities with various levels of V2H
   performance.
   Methods: Semistructured interviews with VHA personnel (N=33) from three
   facilities were conducted. The facilities were selected by overall
   number of mental health V2H visits during fiscal year (FY) 2015 as well
   as by growth in number of visits from FY 2014 through FY 2015. Factors
   influencing implementation were identified through qualitative analyses
   that contrasted responses by groups of participants with three different
   levels of V2H experience (no experience, limited experience, most
   experience) as well as three facilities that differed in V2H
   productivity (high visit count, high visit growth, and low visit count
   and low visit growth).
   Results: Providers seemed to encounter different barriers and
   facilitators depending on their level of experience with V2H. Site-level
   analyses illustrated the importance of logistical support, especially
   for providers who are newly adopting the technology. Other factors that
   differentiated the facilities were also identified and described.
   Conclusions: Key factors related to implementation of V2H telehealth
   pertained to provider buy-in and logistical support. Facility-level
   strategies that address these factors may enhance provider progression
   from nonuse to sustained use.}},

   Methods: The technique was introduced to the humanitarian care setting

   Results: Fifteen cases of myringoplasty were successfully completed.
   Conclusion: The apparent advantages of the endoscopic approach over the
   traditional microscopic one were the ease of transporting the equipment
   and the optimal view obtained of the tympanic membrane. The ability for
   pathology and operative technique to be observed equally well by the
   surgeon and local staff was helpful for teaching, and enables a move
   towards self-sufficiency of care. Easy image capture also has potential
   for remote telemedicine applications.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVETo evaluate whether telemedicine (TM) follow-up of patients
   with diabetes-related foot ulcers (DFUs) in primary health care in
   collaboration with specialist health care was noninferior to standard
   outpatient care (SOC) for ulcer healing time. Further, we sought to
   evaluate whether the proportion of amputations, deaths, number of
   consultations per month, and patient satisfaction differed between the
   two groups.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSPatients with DFUs were recruited
   from three clinical sites in western Norway (2012-2016). The
   cluster-randomized controlled noninferiority trial included 182 adults
   (94/88 in the TM/SOC groups) in 42 municipalities/districts. The
   intervention group received TM follow-up care in the community; the
   control group received SOC. The primary end point was healing time.
   Secondary end points were amputation, death, number of consultations per
   month, and patient satisfaction.RESULTSUsing mixed-effects regression
   analysis, we found that TM was noninferior to SOC regarding healing time
   (mean difference -0.43 months, 95\% CI -1.50, 0.65). When competing risk
   from death and amputation were taken into account, there was no
   significant difference in healing time between the groups (subhazard
   ratio 1.16, 95\% CI 0.85, 1.59). The TM group had a significantly lower
   proportion of amputations (mean difference -8.3\%, 95\% CI -16.3\%,
   -0.5\%), and there were no significant differences in the proportion of
   deaths, number of consultations, or patient satisfaction between groups,
   although the direction of the effect estimates for these clinical
   outcomes favored the TM group.CONCLUSIONSThe results suggest that use of
   TM technology can be a relevant alternative and supplement to usual
   care, at least for patients with more superficial ulcers.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Telehealth can improve access to specialist care. Very few
   reports of the use of smartphones for teleotolaryngology exist. The
   objective of this study is to evaluate the use of mobile
   teleotolaryngology facilitated by a nonotolaryngologist physician.
   Methods: A prospective study in adult patients attending a general
   otolaryngology outpatient clinic. The telehealth encounter with a remote
   otolaryngologist was facilitated by a final-year medical student
   simulating a general physician prior to the scheduled visit. The patient
   and the remote otolaryngologist rated their satisfaction with the
   encounter. The remote otolaryngologist formulated a diagnosis and rated
   the level of certainty of this diagnosis. Diagnoses from the telehealth
   encounter and the face-to-face encounter were compared.
   Results: Forty-eight patients with an average age of 42.5 years
   participated in this study. In 79.2\% of the consultations, there was
   concordance between the diagnoses. The average patient and remote
   otolaryngologist satisfaction with the encounter was 9.5 +/- 0.9 and 8.7
   +/- 1.3, respectively. Twenty-four of the 48 visits (50\%) were defined
   as unnecessary. In the otology group, concordance rates and rates of
   preventable visits were highest.
   Conclusions: Synchronous telehealth consultations, facilitated by a
   general physician, can be an alternative to visiting a general
   otolaryngology clinic, especially for otologic patients.}},

Title = {{Assessment of Ileostomy Output Using Telemedicine: A Feasibility Trial}},
Journal = {{DISEASES OF THE COLON \& RECTUM}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{61}},

Pages = {{77-83}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Ileostomies are a routine part of the care of patients with
   rectal cancer, but are associated with significant risk for dehydration,
   readmission, and acute kidney injury. Telemedicine has proven beneficial
   in decreasing readmission in chronic medical illnesses, but its utility
   in patients with an ileostomy is not well studied.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of
   televideoconferencing in the assessment of ileostomy output.
   DESIGN: An institutional review board-approved, prospective clinical
   trial was conducted at a single institution from November 2014 through
   December 2015.
   SETTINGS: The study was conducted in a single, large academic medical
   center.
   PATIENTS: Patients >18 years of age undergoing surgery with plans for
   ileostomy were eligible.
   INTERVENTIONS: Televideoconference assessments of ileostomy output and
   the need for medical intervention were conducted during the
   postoperative stay and compared with in-person assessment.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point of the trial was the
   feasibility of using teleconferencing to assess the need for medical
   intervention, defined as 90\% agreement between telemedicine and
   in-person assessments. Secondary end points included patient/provider
   satisfaction, and correlative studies examined dehydration events and
   readmission.
   RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients underwent 44 teleconferencing assessments
   of ileostomy output. Compared with in-person treatment decisions, there
   was a 95\% match (95\% CI, 85\%-99\%). The readmission rate for the
   study participants was 31\%, and 18\% experienced dehydration events.
   Both patients and faculty responded favorably to surveys regarding the
   use of telemedicine in the perioperative period.
   LIMITATIONS: The study is limited by its in-hospital use of technology
   and small sample size.
   CONCLUSIONS: Televideoconference evaluation is a feasible, reliable
   means of assessing ileostomy output with high patient and physician
   acceptance. Our pilot study provides rationale for further study in the
   postdischarge setting for patients with ileostomies. The incorporation
   of televideoconference assessment within a teledischarge program may
   enable early intervention to improve patient outcomes. See Video

Abstract = {{Light microscopy is an essential tool in histological examination of
   tissue samples. However, the required equipment for a correct and rapid
   diagnosis is sometimes unavailable. Smartphones and mobile phone
   networks are widespread, and could be used for diagnostic imaging and
   telemedicine. Macrovesicular steatosis (MS) is a major risk factor for
   liver graft failure, and is only assessable by microscopic examination
   of a frozen tissue section. The aim of this study was to compare the
   microscopic assessment of MS in liver allograft biopsies by a smartphone
   with eyepiece adaptor (BLIPS device) to standard light microscopy. Forty
   liver graft biopsies were evaluated in transmitted light, using an
   Iphone 5s and 4 different mini-objective, add-on lenses. A significant
   correlation was reported between the two different approaches for graft
   MS assessment (Spearman's correlation coefficient: r(s)=0.946; p<.001).
   Smartphone with eyepiece adaptor had similar discriminatory power to
   identify MS in liver grafts than standard light microscopy. Based on
   these findings, a smartphone integrated with a low-cost eyepiece adaptor
   can achieve adequate accuracy in the assessment of MS in liver graft,
   and could be used as an alternative to standard light microscope when
   unavailable.}},

Title = {{Real-time teleophthalmology video consultation: an analysis of patient
   satisfaction in rural Western Australia}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPTOMETRY}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundTeleophthalmology, particularly real-time video consultation,
   holds great potential in Australia and similar countries worldwide,
   where geography, population and medical workforce distribution make it
   difficult to provide specialist eye services outside of major cities.
   Assessment and referrals from rural optometrists are vital to the
   success of teleophthalmology. While there is good evidence for the
   efficacy of such services, there is limited evidence for patient
   satisfaction with video consultation.
   MethodsTo evaluate patient satisfaction with teleophthalmology, the
   current study recruited patients who underwent a video consultation with
   Lions Outback Vision, for a follow-up telephone-based questionnaire
   assessing satisfaction. Regression analysis was performed assessing
   which demographic features and which features of the video consultation
   itself were associated with highest overall satisfaction.
   ResultsOne hundred and nine of the 137 eligible patients completed the
   questionnaire (79.6 per cent; 55 per cent male; mean age 64.61 years).
   The majority of the participants were either Very satisfied' (69.1 per
   cent) or Satisfied' (24.5 per cent) with the service. No one reported
   being either Dissatisfied' or Very dissatisfied'. Linear regression did
   not reveal any demographic or follow-up variables as predictive of
   greater total satisfaction; however, participants who were older, felt
   they could easily explain their medical problems to the doctor in the
   video consultation and believed that telemedicine enabled them to save
   money and time, and were more likely to report higher overall
   satisfaction.
   ConclusionTeleophthalmology is a promising new way to overcome barriers
   to the delivery of eye care services to rural and remote populations.
   This study demonstrates a high level of overall satisfaction with
   teleophthalmological video consultation and patients are accepting of
   this emerging consultation modality, regardless of age.}},

Title = {{Stakeholder influence in public sector information systems strategy
   implementation-The case of public hospitals in South Africa}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{39-48}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recent literature on organisational strategy has called for greater
   emphasis on individuals (stakeholders) and what they do in the process
   of strategizing. Public sector organisations have to engage with an
   array of heterogeneous stakeholders in fulfilling their mandate. The
   public health sector in particular needs to engage with a diversity of
   stakeholders at local, regional and national levels when strategising.
   The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of stakeholder
   relations on the implementation of Information Systems (IS) strategy in
   public hospitals in South Africa. An interpretive approach using two
   provinces was employed. The Activity Analysis and Development (ActAD)
   framework, an enhanced form of activity theory, was used as the
   theoretical framework. Data was collected using semi-structured
   interviews, meetings, documents analysis, physical artefacts and
   observation. The collected data was analysed using thematic analysis.
   Findings reveal that IS strategy implementation in public hospitals
   involves a large and complex network of stakeholder groups at different
   levels, and over different time periods. These stakeholder groups act in
   accordance with formal and informal roles, rules and modalities. Various
   contextual conditions together with the actions of, and interactions
   between stakeholder groups give rise to the situationality of
   stakeholder relations dynamics and strategy implementation. The multiple
   actions and interactions over time lead to the realisation of some
   aspects of the IS strategy in public hospitals. Given the complexity and
   dynamism of the context there are also certain unplanned implementations
   as well. These relationships are captured in a Stakeholder Relations
   Influence (SRI) framework. The SRI framework can be assistive in the
   assessment and mapping of stakeholders and stakeholder relations, and
   the assessment of the implications of these relations for effective IS
   strategy implementation in public hospitals. The framework can also
   provide the basis for the development of appropriate corrective measures
   in the implementation of strategies and policies in public institutions
   such as public hospitals.}},

   in Norway: a mixed methods study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Norway has a long history of using telemedicine, especially
   for geographical reasons. Despite the availability of promising
   telemedicine applications and the implementation of national initiatives
   and policies, the sustainability and scaling-up of telemedicine in the
   health system is still far from accomplished. The main objective of this
   study was to explore and identify the multi-level (micro, meso and
   macro) factors affecting telemedicine utilization in Norway.
   Methods: We used a mixed methods approach. Data from a national registry
   were collected to analyze the use of outpatient visits and telemedicine
   contacts in Norway from 2009 to 2015. Interviews with key stakeholders
   at national, regional and local level helped complete and contextualize
   the data analysis and explore the main issues affecting the use of
   telemedicine by health authorities and hospitals. Relevant national
   documents were also used to support, contradict, contextualize or
   clarify information and data.
   Results: Telemedicine use in Norway from 2009 to 2015 remained very low,
   not exceeding 0.5\% of total outpatient activity at regional level and
   0.1\% at national level. All four regions used telemedicine. Of the 29
   hospitals, 24 used it at least once over the 7-year period. Telemedicine
   was not used regularly everywhere, with some hospitals using it
   sporadically. Telemedicine was mostly used in selected specialties,
   including rehabilitation, neurosurgery, skin and venereal diseases.
   Three major themes affecting implementation and utilization of
   telemedicine in Norway emerged: (i) governance and strategy; (ii)
   organizational and professional dimensions; (iii) economic and financial
   dimensions. For each theme, a number of factors and challenges faced at
   different health care levels were identified.
   Conclusions: This study allowed shedding light on multi-level and
   interdependent factors affecting utilization of telemedicine in Norway.
   The identification of the main implementation and utilization challenges
   might support decision makers and practitioners in the successful
   scaling-up of telemedicine. This work provides a knowledge base useful
   to other countries which intend to implement telemedicine or other
   digital health services into their healthcare systems.}},

Title = {{Advancing beyond the system: telemedicine nurses' clinical reasoning
   using a computerised decision support system for patients with COPD - an
   ethnographic study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Telemedicine is changing traditional nursing care, and
   entails nurses performing advanced and complex care within a new
   clinical environment, and monitoring patients at a distance.
   Telemedicine practice requires complex disease management, advocating
   that the nurses' reasoning and decision-making processes are supported.
   Computerised decision support systems are being used increasingly to
   assist reasoning and decision-making in different situations. However,
   little research has focused on the clinical reasoning of nurses using a
   computerised decision support system in a telemedicine setting.
   Therefore, the objective of the study is to explore the process of
   telemedicine nurses' clinical reasoning when using a computerised
   decision support system for the management of patients with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease. The factors influencing the reasoning and
   decision-making processes were investigated.
   Methods: In this ethnographic study, a combination of data collection
   methods, including participatory observations, the think-aloud
   technique, and a focus group interview was employed. Collected data were
   analysed using qualitative content analysis.
   Results: When telemedicine nurses used a computerised decision support
   system for the management of patients with complex, unstable chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease, two categories emerged: ``the process of
   telemedicine nurses' reasoning to assess health change{''} and ``the
   influence of the telemedicine setting on nurses' reasoning and
   decision-making processes{''}. An overall theme, termed ``advancing
   beyond the system{''}, represented the connection between the reasoning
   processes and the telemedicine work and setting, where being familiar
   with the patient functioned as a foundation for the nurses' clinical
   reasoning process.
   Conclusion: In the telemedicine setting, when supported by a
   computerised decision support system, nurses' reasoning was enabled by
   the continuous flow of digital clinical data, regular video-mediated
   contact and shared decision-making with the patient. These factors
   fostered an in-depth knowledge of the patients and acted as a foundation
   for the nurses' reasoning process. Nurses' reasoning frequently advanced
   beyond the computerised decision support system recommendations. Future
   studies are warranted to develop more accurate algorithms, increase
   system maturity, and improve the integration of the digital clinical
   information with clinical experiences, to support telemedicine nurses'
   reasoning process.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness among
   working-age adults. Early diagnosis through effective screening programs
   is likely to improve vision outcomes. The ETDRS seven-standard-field
   35-mm stereoscopic color retinal imaging (ETDRS) of the dilated eye is
   elaborate and requires mydriasis, and is unsuitable for screening. We
   evaluated an image analysis application for the automated diagnosis of
   DR from non-mydriatic single-field images. Patients suffering from
   diabetes for at least 5 years were included if they were 18 years or
   older. Patients already diagnosed with DR were excluded. Physiologic
   mydriasis was achieved by placing the subjects in a dark room. Images
   were captured using a Bosch Mobile Eye Care fundus camera. The images
   were analyzed by the Retinal Imaging Bosch DR Algorithm for the
   diagnosis of DR. All subjects also subsequently underwent
   pharmacological mydriasis and ETDRS imaging. Non-mydriatic and mydriatic
   images were read by ophthalmologists. The ETDRS readings were used as
   the gold standard for calculating the sensitivity and specificity for
   the software. 564 consecutive subjects (1128 eyes) were recruited from
   six centers in India. Each subject was evaluated at a single outpatient
   visit. Forty-four of 1128 images (3.9\%) could not be read by the
   algorithm, and were categorized as inconclusive. In four subjects,
   neither eye provided an acceptable image: these four subjects were
   excluded from the analysis. This left 560 subjects for analysis (1084
   eyes). The algorithm correctly diagnosed 531 of 560 cases. The
   sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values
   were 91\%, 97\%, 94\%, and 95\% respectively. The Bosch DR Algorithm
   shows favorable sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing DR from
   non-mydriatic images, and can greatly simplify screening for DR. This
   also has major implications for telemedicine in the use of screening for
   retinopathy in patients with diabetes mellitus.}},

Title = {{Belo Horizonte-Telehealth: Incorporation of Teleconsultations in a
   Health Primary Care System}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Introduction:The Belo Horizonte Telehealth program, a pioneer in
   telemedicine within the Brazilian National Health System (Sistema unico
   de SauUde in Portuguese), was implemented by the Belo Horizonte City
   Health Department (SMSA-BH) in 2004. The purpose of the present study is
   to analyze opinions on the obstacles, difficulties, and suggestions on
   the use of teleconsultations.Methods:Semi-structured interviews were
   conducted among primary healthcare professionals and health managers.
   Content analysis for the latter was carried out using NVIVO (R) software
   to categorize responses. Simple descriptive quantitative aspects were
   analyzed to verify the use of the system over the years by the primary
   care unit (PCU) professionals.Results:The difficulties encountered were
   related to the use of the system, inadequate response to
   teleconsultation requests, infrastructure problems, lack of practicality
   for the use of the program, difficulty in incorporating the program into
   the organizational culture, and lack of managerial support. Changes in
   management organization over the years have interfered with the use of
   the teleconsultation system. The most requested specialties were
   neurology, cardiology, endocrinology, and angiology.Discussion:The main
   suggestions for increasing the number of teleconsultations requests
   included dissemination of information and prioritization by the
   management; improvement of the infrastructure; organization of the time
   and the agenda of the PCU professional; training the professionals for
   its use; and preconditioning the referrals to secondary level care to a
   previous teleconsultation.Conclusion:Teleconsultations need to be
   incorporated in the daily routine of PCUs by both managers and health
   professionals to assure its usage and improve the quality of care.}},

Title = {{Identification and Evaluation of Medical Translator Mobile Applications
   Using an Adapted APPLICATIONS Scoring System}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Importance:With an increasing number of patients requiring translator
   services, many providers are turning to mobile applications (apps) for
   assistance. However, there have been no published reviews of medical
   translator apps.Objective:To identify and evaluate medical translator
   mobile apps using an adapted APPLICATIONS scoring system.Design:A list
   of apps was identified from the Apple iTunes and Google Play stores,
   using the search term, medical translator. Apps not found on two
   different searches, not in an English-based platform, not used for
   translation, or not functional after purchase, were excluded. The
   remaining apps were evaluated using an adapted APPLICATIONS scoring
   system, which included both objective and subjective criteria. App
   comprehensiveness was a weighted score defined by the number of
   non-English languages included in each app relative to the proportion of
   non-English speakers in the United States.Setting:The Apple iTunes and
   Google Play stores.Participants:Medical translator apps identified using
   the search term medical translator.Main Outcomes and
   Measures:Compilation of medical translator apps for provider
   usage.Results:A total of 524 apps were initially found. After applying
   the exclusion criteria, 20 (8.2\%) apps from the Google Play store and
   26 (9.2\%) apps from the Apple iTunes store remained for evaluation. The
   highest scoring apps, Canopy Medical Translator, Universal Doctor
   Speaker, and Vocre Translate, scored 13.5 out of 18.7 possible
   points.Conclusions and Relevance:A large proportion of apps initially
   found did not function as medical translator apps. Using the
   APPLICATIONS scoring system, we have identified and evaluated medical
   translator apps for providers who care for non-English speaking

Title = {{Frequent Hub-Spoke Contact Is Associated with Improved Spoke Hospital
   Performance: Results from the Massachusetts General Hospital Telestroke
   Network}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:For acute ischemic stroke patients, shorter time to
   thrombolytic (tissue plasminogen activator {[}tPA]) is associated with
   improved outcomes.Introduction:Telestroke increases tPA use at spoke
   hospitals, yet its effect on door-to-needle (DTN) times for tPA
   administration is unknown. We hypothesize that spoke hospitals with more
   frequent contact to a hub hospital will have shorter DTN times than
   those with less frequent contact.Materials and Methods:We identified 375
   patients treated with tPA by conventional or telestroke methods in an
   academic hub-and-spoke telestroke network for whom date and time data
   were available. Strength of the spoke-hub connection was the primary
   predictor variable, defined as the number of all telestroke consults
   (tPA and non-tPA) done at each spoke hospital during the year of the
   patient's presentation. Patient-level regression analyses examined the
   relationship between DTN time and spoke-hub connection during the year
   of the patient's presentation, controlling for temporal trends and
   clustering within hospitals.Results:Sixteen spoke hospitals contributed
   data on 375 tPA-treated patients from 2006-2015. Hospitals treated a
   median of 13.5 patients with tPA per year; median hospital-level DTN was
   78.8min (interquartile range {[}IQR] 71.3-85). Median number of
   telestroke consults per year was 34 (range 3-137). Among all 375
   patients, median DTN was 76min (IQR 60-97). Strength of spoke-hub
   connection was significantly associated with faster DTN time for
   patients (1.3min gain per 10 additional consults,
   p=0.048).Conclusions:More frequent contact between a telestroke spoke
   and its hub was associated with faster tPA delivery for patients, even
   after accounting for secular trends in DTN improvements.}},

Title = {{Telehealth Alerts and Nurse Response}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Health monitoring within a telehealth program is a strategy
   to efficiently care for older adults with heart failure (HF). Limited
   description is identified in the literature for the extent participant
   submissions trigger an alert or monitoring nurses transfer telehealth
   alert-range data to the medical record.Introduction:The aim was to
   describe the initial 90 days of participant submissions measuring within
   alert range and nurse response to alerts with documentation to the
   medical record.Materials and Methods:Review of telehealth and medical
   records of 187 older veterans with HF participating at one Veterans
   Administration Care Coordination Home Telehealth program led to
   reporting the proportion of participant telehealth submissions measuring
   within alert range and nurse response to alert-range data.Results:Less
   than 2.5\% of self-rated health status and nearly one-quarter of
   physiologic submissions measured within alert range. Timely nurse
   response averaged 28.7\% and increased when submissions for vital signs,
   weight, or medication alerted for consecutive days. Neither alert nor
   nurse response data were significantly associated with characteristic
   measures.Discussion:Clinical relevance of alert-range telehealth data is
   uncertain partly due to frequent alerts triggered by physiologic
   submissions, few health status changes noted by the participant or the
   monitoring nurse, and the nonsignificant association between the
   proportion of alerts or nurse response, respectively, with demographic
   or clinical baseline measures.Conclusions:Future studies are needed to
   identify telehealth program measures that decrease alerting data not
   associated with clinical worsening and increase recognition-of-change in
   HF health status by the participant and monitoring nurse.}},

Title = {{Telemedicine in Pediatric Gastroenterology: An Overview of Utility}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:The availability of pediatric subspecialty services is a
   problem evident throughout the United States. Access to pediatric
   gastroenterology services, especially in rural areas, can be scarce.
   Telemedicine has been proposed as a tool capable of decreasing
   healthcare costs while extending medical care.Objective:The purpose of
   this article is to review available literature regarding the utility of
   telemedicine as it applies to pediatric gastroenterology, specifically
   its role in eliminating healthcare disparities.Methods:Research articles
   were identified through a PubMed search with key words focusing on
   telemedicine initiatives in pediatric gastroenterology, pediatric
   subspecialty, rural pediatric care, and adult gastroenterology. Studies
   were categorized based on the following areas of application: financial,
   time management, communication/community, and patient health and
   satisfaction.Results:We reached the conclusion that evidence-supported
   trends in available literature provide a framework for pediatric
   gastroenterology telemedicine initiatives that can provide
   resource-sparing, community-enriching, and physician-improving services
   that ultimately serve to better patient health.}},

Title = {{What Is the Proportion of Studies Reporting Patient and Practitioner
   Satisfaction with Software Support Tools Used in the Management of Knee
   Pain and Is This Related to Sample Size, Effect Size, and Journal Impact
   Factor?}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Introduction:E-health software tools have been deployed in managing knee
   conditions. Reporting of patient and practitioner satisfaction in
   studies regarding e-health usage is not widely explored. The objective
   of this review was to identify studies describing patient and
   practitioner satisfaction with software use concerning knee
   pain.Materials and Methods:A computerized search was undertaken: four
   electronic databases were searched from January 2007 until January 2017.
   Key words were decision dashboard, clinical decision, Web-based
   resource, evidence support, and knee. Full texts were scanned for effect
   of size reporting and satisfaction scales from participants and
   practitioners. Binary regression was run; impact factor and sample size
   were predictors with indicators for satisfaction and effect size
   reporting as dependent variables.Results:Seventy-seven articles were
   retrieved; 37 studies were included in final analysis. Ten studies
   reported patient satisfaction ratings (27.8\%): a single study reported
   both patient and practitioner satisfaction (2.8\%). Randomized control
   trials were the most common design (35\%) and knee osteoarthritis the
   most prevalent condition (38\%). Electronic patient-reported outcome
   measures and Web-based training were the most common interventions. No
   significant dependency was found within the regression models (p >
   0.05).Discussion and Conclusions:The proportion of reporting of patient
   satisfaction was low; practitioner satisfaction was poorly represented.
   There may be implications for the suitability of administering e-health,
   a medium for capturing further meta-evidence needs to be established and
   used as best practice for implicated studies in future. This is the
   first review of its kind to address patient and practitioner
   satisfaction with knee e-health.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Telemedicine to Traditional Face-to-Face Care for Children
   with Special Needs: A Quasiexperimental Study}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Services for Children with Special Healthcare Needs (CSHCN)
   have been challenging in terms of cost and access to appropriate
   healthcare services.Objectives:The objectives of this study were to
   examine cost, caring, and family-centered care in relationship to
   pediatric specialty services integrating telemedicine visits compared to
   traditional face-to-face visits only for (CSHCN) in rural, remote, and
   medically underserved areas.Methods:This study used a prospective,
   quasiexperimental research design with 222 parents or legal guardians of
   CSHCN receiving pediatric specialty care. The traditional group (n=110)
   included families receiving face-to-face pediatric specialty care and
   the telemedicine group (n=112) included families who had telemedicine
   visits along with traditional face-to-face pediatric specialty
   care.Results:Results indicated no significant differences in family
   costs when the telemedicine group was compared to traditional
   face-to-face care. When the telemedicine group was asked to anticipate
   costs if telemedicine was not available, there were significant
   differences found across all variables, including travel miles, cost of
   travel, missed work hours, wages lost, child care cost, lodging cost,
   other costs, and total family cost (p < 0.001). There were no
   differences in the families' perceptions of care as caring.
   Parents/guardians perceived the system of care as significantly more
   family-centered when using telemedicine (p=0.003).Conclusions:The
   results of this study underscore the importance of facilitating access
   to pediatric specialty care by use of telemedicine. We endorse efforts
   to increase healthcare access and decrease cost for CSHCN by expanding
   telemedicine and shaping health policy accordingly.}},

Title = {{Which strategies might improve local primary healthcare in Germany? An
   explorative study from a local government point of view}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Facing rising inequities and poorer accessibility of
   physicians in rural areas, new healthcare delivery structures are being
   considered to support local healthcare in German communities. To better
   understand perspectives on and attitudes towards different supplementary
   models, we examined attitudes among local politicians in the German
   federal state of Lower Saxony towards the suitability of supplementary
   care models.
   Methods: As part of a cross-sectional study, we surveyed local
   politicians in Lower Saxony at the local authority and district levels
   (n = 449) by mail questionnaire. We asked for an assessment of four
   potential supplementary healthcare models at the local level: the use of
   trained medical assistants, patients' buses, mobile physicians' offices,
   and telemedicine.
   Results: The response rate was 71.0\% for mayors (n = 292) and 81.6\% (n
   = 31) for county administrators. In summary, 72.4\% of respondents
   supported the use of trained medical assistants, 48.9\% voted for
   patients' buses, 22.0\% for mobile physicians' offices, and 13.9\% for
   telemedicine. Except for telemedicine, the politicians' approval of the
   supplementary models in rural areas was higher than in urban areas. The
   assessment regarding the suitability of each model was not significantly
   connected with indicators of a positively or negatively assessed local
   healthcare situation. The analyses showed that the use of trained
   medical assistants was associated with the positive effects of division
   of labor and potential to relieve physicians. In contrast, there was
   skepticism about technical support via telemedicine, mostly due to
   concerns about its unsuitability for elderly people and the potential
   lower quality of healthcare delivery.
   Conclusion: Local politicians widely accept the use of trained medical
   assistants, whereas the applicability of technical solutions such as
   telemedicine is perceived with skepticism. Therefore, the knowledge gap
   between evidence for and prejudices against telemedicine needs to be
   addressed more effectively. Reasons for the assessments of the presented
   models are more likely traceable to personal views than to assessments
   of the actual estimated local primary care situation.}},

Title = {{Communication with Orthopedic Trauma Patients via an Automated Mobile
   Phone Messaging Robot}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Communication with orthopedic trauma patients is
   traditionally problematic with low response rates (RRs). The purpose of
   this investigation was to (1) evaluate the feasibility of communicating
   with orthopedic trauma patients postoperatively, utilizing an automated
   mobile phone messaging platform; and (2) assess the first 2 weeks of
   postoperative patient-reported pain and opioid use after lower extremity
   orthopedic trauma procedures.Materials and Methods:This was a
   prospective investigation at a Level 1 trauma center in the United
   States. Adult patients who were capable of mobile phone messaging and
   were undergoing common, lower extremity orthopedic trauma procedures
   were enrolled in the study. Patients received a daily mobile phone
   message protocol inquiring about their current pain level and amount of
   opioid medication they had taken in the past 24h starting on
   postoperative day (POD) 3 and continuing through POD 17. Our analysis
   considered (1) Patient completion rate of mobile phone questions, (2)
   Patient-reported pain level (0-10 scale), and (3) Number and percentage
   of daily prescribed opioid medication patients reported
   taking.Results:Twenty-five patients were enrolled in this investigation.
   Patients responded to 87.5\% of the pain and opioid medication inquiries
   they received over the 2-week study period. There were no differences in
   RRs by patient age, sex, or educational attainment. Patient-reported
   pain decreased over the initial 2-week study period from an average of
   4.91.7 on POD 3 to 3 +/- 2.2 on POD 16-17. Patients took an average of
   68\% of their maximum daily narcotic prescription on POD 3 compared with
   35\% of their prescribed pain medication on POD 16-17.Conclusions:We
   found that in orthopedic trauma patients, an automated mobile phone
   messaging platform elicited a high patient RR that improved upon prior
   methods in the literature. This method may be used to reliably obtain
   pain and medication utilization data after trauma procedures.}},

Title = {{User Experience of an Innovative Mobile Health Program to Assist in
   Insulin Dose Adjustment: Outcomes of a Proof-of-Concept Trial}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many patients with diabetes require insulin therapy to
   achieve optimal glycemic control. Initiation and titration of insulin
   often require an insulin dose adjustment (IDA) program, involving
   frequent exchange of blood glucose levels (BGLs) and insulin
   prescription advice between the patient and healthcare team. This
   process is time consuming with logistical barriers. Objective: To
   develop an innovative mobile health (m-Health) mobile-based IDA program
   (mIDA) and evaluate the user adherence and experience through a
   proof-of-concept trial. Methods: In the program, an m-Health system was
   designed to be integrated within a clinical IDA service, comprising a
   Bluetooth-enabled glucose meter, smartphone application, and clinician
   portal. Insulin-requiring patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus and
   stable BGL were recruited to use the m-Health system to record and
   exchange BGL entries, insulin dosages, and clinical messages for 2
   weeks. The user experience was evaluated by a Likert scale
   questionnaire. Results: Nine participants, aged 5814 years (mean +/-
   SD), completed the trial with average daily records of 3.1 BGL entries
   and 1.2 insulin dosage entries. The participants recognized the
   potential value of the clinical messages. They felt confident about
   managing their diabetes and were positive regarding ease of use and
   family support of the system, but disagreed that there were no technical
   issues. Finally, they were satisfied with the program and would continue
   to use it if possible. Conclusions: The m-Health system for IDA showed
   promising levels of adherence, usability, perception of usefulness, and
   satisfaction. Further research is required to assess the feasibility and
   cost-effectiveness of using this system in outpatient settings.}},

Title = {{Changes in User Perceptions of a Telemedicine System Over Time: From
   Initial Implementation to Everyday Use}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Benefits associated with telemedicine are contingent upon
   positive user perceptions. Despite this, research on user perceptions of
   telemedicine remains limited.Introduction:Usability approaches offer a
   robust way to assess user perceptions, but have rarely been applied in
   telemedicine. In this study, a usability approach was employed to
   examine how user perceptions toward a telemedicine system changed over
   the course of everyday use.Materials and Methods:A telemedicine system
   was introduced to a hospital in the home service. Ten mobile nurses
   completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) after initial use, then again
   after 18 months of everyday use. Results were compared. Analysis
   included Bangor et al.'s (2009) adjective rating scale.Results:The
   initial SUS mean was 83 (standard deviation {[}SD]=7.98), indicating
   excellent usability. After 18 months, the SUS mean was 64.38, indicating
   OK usability (SD=14.25, p < 0.05, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]). Over
   time, users had lower desire to use the system frequently (p < 0.05,
   95\% CI), found it more complex (p < 0.05, 95\% CI), and perceived
   greater inconsistency in its design (p < 0.05, 95\%
   CI).Discussion:Considered with existing evidence, our usability findings
   indicate that a temporary period of positive user perceptions occurs
   when new telemedicine systems are used for the first few months. This
   fades with everyday use, with design inconsistency and perceived
   complexity becoming more noticeable. Although other factors such as user
   satisfaction and efficiency may also contribute, further studies are
   needed for confirmation.Conclusions:User perceptions of telemedicine
   vary with time. To help maximize the benefits and longevity of
   telemedicine systems, responding to intermittent user appraisal is
   desirable.}},

Title = {{Who Uses eConsult? Investigating Physician Characteristics Associated
   with Usage (and Nonusage)}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:The Champlain BASE eConsult Service was developed in a Local
   Health Integration Network (LHIN) in Ontario, Canada in 2010 to reduce
   wait times and improve access to specialist care. The service allows
   primary care providers to receive advice from specialists via a secure
   electronic platform without necessarily requiring a face-to-face
   consultation.Introduction:As of 2015, over half of the LHIN's family
   physicians were registered and trained to use the service. However, 24\%
   of registrants never went on to submit a case. The purpose of this study
   is to examine the demographic characteristics associated with
   usage.Materials and Methods:Usage data for the pool of physicians
   registered between January 1, 2011 and September 30, 2015 were linked to
   physician characteristics retrieved from the College of Physicians and
   Surgeons of Ontario database. Probit regressions were estimated to
   determine characteristics associated with usage.Results:Neither sex,
   being an international medical school graduate-documented predictors of
   electronic medical records adoption-nor proximity to specialists were
   found to explain usage. Only length of time in practice was found to be
   predictive. Being out of medical school an additional 10 years was
   estimated to decrease the probability of ever using eConsult by five
   percentage points (p < 0.01).Conclusion:Lower use by veteran physicians
   may reflect their lower need for services like eConsult given their
   well-established specialist networks, or their greater confidence in
   practicing medicine. Future work should explore the reasons and barriers
   for not registering, or not using eConsult, with an aim toward
   increasing the appropriate use of this cost-effective and innovative
   service.}},

Title = {{Internet Use and Technology-Related Attitudes of Veterans and Informal
   Caregivers of Veterans}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Healthcare systems are interested in technology-enhanced
   interventions to improve patient access and outcomes. However, there is
   uncertainty about feasibility and acceptability for groups who may
   benefit but are at risk for disparities in technology use. Thus, we
   sought to describe characteristics of Internet use and
   technology-related attitudes for two such groups: (1) Veterans with
   multi-morbidity and high acute care utilization and (2) informal
   caregivers of Veterans with substantial care needs at home.Materials and
   Methods:We used survey data from two ongoing trials, for 423 Veteran and
   169 caregiver participants, respectively. Questions examined Internet
   use in the past year, willingness to communicate via videoconferencing,
   and comfort with new technology devices.Results:Most participants used
   Internet in the past year (81\% of Veterans, 82\% of caregivers); the
   majority of users (83\% of Veterans, 92\% of caregivers) accessed
   Internet at least a few times a week, and used a private laptop or
   computer (81\% of Veterans, 89\% of caregivers). Most were willing to
   use videoconferencing via private devices (77-83\%). A majority of
   participants were comfortable attempting to use new devices with
   in-person assistance (80\% of Veterans, 85\% of caregivers), whereas
   lower proportions were comfortable on your own (58-59\% for Veterans and
   caregivers). Internet use was associated with comfort with new
   technology devices (odds ratio 2.76, 95\% confidence interval
   1.70-4.53).Conclusions:Findings suggest that technology-enhanced
   healthcare interventions are feasible and acceptable for Veterans with
   multi-morbidity and high healthcare utilization, and informal caregivers
   of Veterans. In-person assistance may be important for those with no
   recent Internet use.}},

Title = {{Telemedicine in Pediatric Critical Care: A Retrospective Study in an
   International Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Program}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Introduction:Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an invaluable
   rescue technique for critically ill children with imminent or present
   cardiopulmonary collapse. However, medical team expertise to optimize
   results and decrease complications is scarce. Telemedicine can be used
   to enhance the delivery of quality interventions.Materials and
   Methods:This is a retrospective review of pediatric patients assisted
   with ECMO in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) at Fundacion
   Cardiovascular de Colombia from July 2011 to June 2015 (telemedicine)
   compared with similar patients from a previous period (pretelemedicine).
   Collected information included demographic data, cardiac diagnosis, risk
   adjustment for congenital heart surgery (RACHS-1), hospital mortality,
   CICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), ECMO type, and ECMO run hours as
   well as specific telemedicine information.Results:Fifty-seven patients
   in the pretelemedicine and 109 in the telemedicine periods were included
   in the analysis. Forty-nine teleconsulted patients received 218
   teleconsultations, with a recommendation for diagnostic or
   interventional catheterization in 38 patients (77.5\%). A surgical
   procedure for significant residual lesions was recommended in 30
   patients (61.2\%). Patients in the telemedicine period were older (4.7
   months vs. 1.6 months, p=0.006), more likely to receive operating room
   ECMO (43.1\% vs. 24.6\%, p=0.02), and had a higher proportion of
   patients with two-ventricle physiology (73.4\% vs. 54.4\%, p=0.013).
   Hospital survival was higher during the telemedicine period (54.1\% vs.
   29.8\%, p=0.002), with a longer hospital LOS (67 days vs. 28 days, p <
   0.001).Conclusion:The implementation of telemedicine-assisted
   interventions in a pediatric ECMO program delivered valuable diagnostic
   and therapeutic advice, was associated with significant changes in
   selection criteria and model of care, and an increased hospital
   survival.}},

Abstract = {{Telemedicine is an emerging field in recent medical achievements with
   rapid development. The ``smartphone{''} availability has increased in
   both developed and developing countries even among people in rural and
   remotes areas. Tele-based services can be used for screening ophthalmic
   diseases and also monitoring patients with known diseases. Electronic
   ophthalmologic records of the patients including captured images by
   smartphones from anterior and posterior segments of the eye will be
   evaluated by ophthalmologists, and if patients require further
   evaluations, they will be referred to experts in the relevant field. Eye
   diseases such as cataract, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration,
   diabetic retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity are the most common
   causes of blindness in many countries and beneficial use of
   teleophthalmology with smartphones will be a good way to achieve the aim
   of VISION 2020 all over the world. Numerous studies have shown that
   teleophthalmology is similar to the conventional eye care system in
   clinical outcomes and even provides more patient satisfaction as it
   saves time and cost. This review explains how teleophthalmology helps to
   improve patient outcomes through smartphones.}},

Title = {{Using Home-Program Adherence App in Pediatric Therapy: Case Study of
   Sensory Processing Disorder}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Pediatric therapies adopt a family-centered approach that
   encourages a caregiver's involvement in therapy. Contextual
   interventions in the child's natural environment have been effective in
   generalization of skills and increasing of child participation in daily
   activities. The use of home programs is common across a variety of
   conditions, but adherence has been challenging. Apps have been
   demonstrated to promote medication adherence and physical activity
   maintenance.Introduction:This study suggested and tested a construct for
   features required for caregivers' behavioral modification during home
   programs in pediatric therapy.Materials and Methods:SensoryTreat is an
   adherence promoting app for home-program treatments of children with
   sensory processing disorders. The app was evaluated by testing
   availability of desired features, usage frequency, impact on adherence
   with home programs, and parental sense of competence.Results:Results
   suggest a strong significant correlation between SensoryTreat usage
   frequency and families' adherence with home programs, as well as a
   strong significant correlation between relevancy and usefulness of
   SensoryTreat's interventional content, and parental competence and their
   adherence with home programs.Discussion:Using SensoryTreat twice or more
   per week increases parental adherence with home programs. Content plays
   an important role in promoting adherence and parental sense of
   competence, yet, as usage frequency grows the interventional content
   habituates, and other features as goal setting and feedback logs have
   significant impact on parental competence and adherence with home
   programs over time.Conclusions:These findings indicate that the content
   and features of SensoryTreat app have the potential to promote adherence
   of families with pediatric therapy home programs.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE A deep learning system (DLS) is a machine learning technology
   with potential for screening diabetic retinopathy and related eye
   diseases.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the performance of a DLS in detecting referable
   diabetic retinopathy, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, possible
   glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in community and
   clinic-based multiethnic populations with diabetes.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Diagnostic performance of a DLS for
   diabetic retinopathy and related eye diseases was evaluated using 494
   661 retinal images. A DLS was trained for detecting diabetic retinopathy
   (using 76 370 images), possible glaucoma (125 189 images), and AMD(72
   610 images), and performance of DLS was evaluated for detecting diabetic
   retinopathy (using 112 648 images), possible glaucoma (71 896 images),
   and AMD(35 948 images). Training of the DLS was completed in May 2016,
   and validation of the DLS was completed in May 2017 for detection of
   referable diabetic retinopathy (moderate nonproliferative diabetic
   retinopathy or worse) and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy
   (severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy orworse) using a primary
   validation data set in the Singapore National Diabetic Retinopathy
   Screening Program and 10 multiethnic cohorts with diabetes.
   EXPOSURES Use of a deep learning system.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity of the DLS
   with professional graders (retinal specialists, general
   ophthalmologists, trained graders, or optometrists) as the reference
   standard.
   RESULTS In the primary validation dataset (n = 14 880 patients; 71 896
   images; mean {[}SD] age, 60.2 {[}2.2] years; 54.6\% men), the prevalence
   of referable diabetic retinopathy was 3.0\%; vision-threatening diabetic
   retinopathy, 0.6\%; possible glaucoma, 0.1\%; and AMD, 2.5\%. The AUC of
   the DLS for referable diabetic retinopathy was 0.936 (95\% CI,
   0.925-0.943), sensitivity was 90.5\%(95\% CI, 87.3\%-93.0\%), and
   specificity was 91.6\% (95\% CI, 91.0\%-92.2\%). For vision-threatening
   diabetic retinopathy, AUC was 0.958 (95\% CI, 0.956-0.961), sensitivity
   was 100\% (95\% CI, 94.1\%-100.0\%), and specificity was 91.1\% (95\%
   CI, 90.7\%-91.4\%). For possible glaucoma, AUC was 0.942 (95\% CI,
   0.929-0.954), sensitivity was 96.4\%(95\% CI, 81.7\%-99.9\%), and
   specificity was 87.2\%(95\% CI, 86.8\%-87.5\%). For AMD, AUC was 0.931
   (95\% CI, 0.928-0.935), sensitivity was 93.2\%(95\% CI, 91.1\%-99.8\%),
   and specificity was 88.7\%(95\% CI, 88.3\%-89.0\%). For referable
   diabetic retinopathy in the 10 additional datasets, AUC range was 0.889
   to 0.983 (n = 40 752 images).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this evaluation of retinal images from
   multiethnic cohorts of patients with diabetes, the DLS had high
   sensitivity and specificity for identifying diabetic retinopathy and
   related eye diseases. Further research is necessary to evaluate the
   applicability of the DLS in health care settings and the utility of the
   DLS to improve vision outcomes.}},

Title = {{Developing a Newborn Resuscitation Telemedicine Program: A Comparison of
   Two Technologies}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Early work has demonstrated the feasibility and acceptance of
   newborn resuscitation telemedicine programs (NRTPs). The technology
   requirements for providing this type of emergency telemedicine service
   are unclear.Introduction:We hypothesized that during NRTP consults, a
   wired telemedicine cart would provide a more reliable and higher-quality
   user experience than a consumer-grade wireless tablet.Materials and
   Methods:In this retrospective observational study, six spoke sites used
   consumer-grade wireless tablets during preintervention and wired
   coder/decoder (CODEC)-based telemedicine carts during postintervention.
   Both technologies used the same videoconferencing software. After the
   telemedicine consult, providers completed surveys assessing connection
   reliability, user satisfaction, and audio and video quality using a 1-5
   Likert scale.Results:Preintervention, users completed 99 consults and 95
   surveys. Postintervention, users completed 73 consults and 192 surveys.
   Successful connection on first attempt was significantly improved with
   the wired cart compared with the wireless tablet (82.7\% vs. 69.5\%,
   p=0.01), and the percentage of consults complicated by an unplanned
   disconnection was reduced (6.4\% vs. 14.7\%, p=0.02). User satisfaction
   and video and audio quality ratings were significantly higher for the
   wired cart.Discussion:The wired telemedicine cart increased connection
   reliability, which is important given the critical nature and long
   duration of NRTP consults. Audio-video quality was also improved,
   allowing for better visualization of the neonate and communication with
   the care team.Conclusions:Consumer-grade wireless tablets did not meet
   the program's technical requirements. Wired telemedicine carts improved
   reliability, user satisfaction, and audio-video quality. Wired carts may
   not fully meet NRTP requirements because of cart size and limited
   mobility.}},

Title = {{A Randomized Study of a Mobile Behavioral Parent Training Application}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background/Introduction:Never before have parents had such immediate
   access to parenting support. The extension of the Internet to
   smartphones, offers the opportunity to provide families with the
   highest-quality information at the time and place that it can be the
   most useful. However, there remain considerable barriers to getting the
   right information to the right people at the right time.Materials and
   Methods:This study includes the initial feasibility testing of a
   smartphone application ParentNet that attempts to deliver on the
   potential of empirically supported therapy by connecting family members
   with specific behavioral goals and outcomes in real time. Participation
   was solicited from community parenting support groups and through online
   social media. Data were collected from 73 parents and 88 children on
   child behavior (adult only) and satisfaction.Results:Data analyses
   showed positive satisfaction and utilization results: (1) users rated
   the ParentNet app very positively (i.e., 85\% of caregivers and 88\% of
   youth would recommend the app to others), and (2) parenting behavior was
   improved with a small/moderate effect-size.Discussion and
   Conclusions:Findings from this initial testing are reviewed along with
   future development possibilities to be considered. Limitations of small
   pilot sample and brief administration period could have reduced effects.
   Further study would include a more robust sample.}},

Title = {{Tele-Pediatric Intensive Care for Critically Ill Children in Syria}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Armed conflicts can result in humanitarian crises and have
   major impacts on civilians, of whom children represent a significant
   proportion. Usual pediatric medical care is often disrupted and trauma
   resulting from war-related injuries is often devastating. High pediatric
   mortality rates are thus experienced in these ravaged medical
   environments.Introduction:Using simple communication technology to
   provide real-time management recommendations from highly trained
   pediatric personnel can provide substantive clinical support and have a
   significant impact on pediatric morbidity and mortality.Materials and
   Methods:We implemented a Tele-Pediatric Intensive Care program
   (Tele-PICU) to provide real-time management consultation for critically
   ill and injured pediatric patients in Syria with intensive care
   needs.Results:Over the course of 7 months, 19 cases were evaluated,
   ranging in age from 1 day to 11 years. Consultation questions addressed
   a wide range of critical care needs. Five patients are known to have
   survived, three were transferred, five died, and six outcomes were
   unknown.Discussion:Based on this limited undertaking with its positive
   impact on survival, further development of Tele-PICU-based efforts with
   attention to implementation and barriers identified through this program
   is desirable.Conclusion:Even limited Tele-PICU can provide timely and
   potentially lifesaving assistance to pediatric care providers. Future
   efforts are encouraged.}},

Title = {{Design and Technical Validation of a Telemedicine Service for Rural
   Healthcare in Ecuador}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Telemedicine is becoming increasingly important in Ecuador,
   especially in areas such as rural primary healthcare and medical
   education. Rural telemedicine programs in the country need to be
   strengthened by means of a technological platform adapted to local
   surroundings and offering advantages such as access to specialized care,
   continuing education, and so on, combined with modest investment
   requirements.Introduction:This present article presents the design of a
   Telemedicine Platform (TMP) for rural healthcare services in Ecuador and
   a preliminary technical validation with medical students and
   teachers.Materials and Methods:An initial field study was designed to
   capture the requirements of the TMP. In a second phase, the TMP was
   validated in an academic environment along three consecutive academic
   courses. Assessment was by means of user polls and analyzing user
   interactions as registered automatically by the platform. The TMP was
   developed using Web-based technology and open code software.Results:One
   hundred twenty-four students and 6 specialized faculty members
   participated in the study, conducting a total of 262 teleconsultations
   of clinical cases and 226 responses, respectively.Conclusion:The
   validation results show that the TMP is a useful communication tool for
   the documentation and discussion of clinical cases. Moreover, its usage
   may be recommended as a teaching methodology, to strengthen the skills
   of medical undergraduates. The results indicate that implementing the
   system in rural healthcare services in Ecuador would be feasible.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In 2012, Maccabi Healthcare Services founded Maccabi
   Telecare Center (MTC), a multi-disciplinary healthcare service providing
   telemedical care to complex chronic patients. The current paper
   describes the establishment and operation of the MTC center, from the
   identification of the need for the service, through the design of its
   solution elements, to outcomes in several areas of care. We analyze the
   effects of the program on elderly frail patients, a growing population
   with complex and costly needs.
   Methods: Observational quasi-experimental analyses using propensity
   score matching was used to assess the effect of MTC's operation on
   utilization outcomes including direct costs.
   Results: Results for frail elderly patients with complex chronic
   conditions show significant reductions in hospitalization days and
   hospitalization costs. MTC interventions also entailed lower overall
   average monthly costs in frail patients.
   Conclusion: We conclude that a proactive telehealth service for complex
   chronic patients using education, empowerment to self-management, and
   coordination of care is a cost-effective means of improving quality care
   and health outcomes in frail elderly patients.}},

Title = {{Attitudes Toward e-Health: The Otolaryngologists' Point of View}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Introduction:Online communication and the number of e-health
   applications have noticeably increased. However, little is known about
   the otolaryngologists' use behavior and their attitudes toward the
   potential of e-health. The aims of the study were to evaluate the
   documentation, information, and communication technologies used by
   otolaryngologists and to get a better understanding of their attitudes
   toward the potential of e-health for cross-sectoral patient
   care.Methods:A survey was developed and tested by otolaryngologists,
   healthcare-information technology experts, and health services
   researchers. A total of 334 otolaryngologists in private practice were
   asked to participate in this cross-sectional study. In total, 234 of
   them took part in the study, and 157 returned completed questionnaires.
   Statistical analysis was performed by using crosstabs, including
   chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regressions.Results and
   Materials:Digital technologies are widely used by otolaryngologists
   (e.g., 89.6\% use an electronic health record). However, the majority of
   intersectoral communication is still based on analogue techniques (e.g.,
   fax use in 63.7\%). From the otolaryngologists' perspectives, the
   potential of e-health for intersectoral care is mostly in appointment
   scheduling, further referrals to hospitals, and automated appointment
   reminders. The physicians' attitudes toward e-health are associated with
   their Internet use behavior in daily life (odds ratio=4.30, confidence
   interval 1.11-16.64, p=0.035) but not with their
   demographics.Discussion:The otolaryngologists are well prepared and have
   an overall positive attitude toward e-health for deeper use in
   cross-sectoral care. Therefore, e-health in otolaryngology needs more
   attention and resources for further studies, especially with a focus on
   quality and safety of care.}},

Title = {{Accuracy of Smartphone-Based Pulse Oximetry Compared with Hospital-Grade
   Pulse Oximetry in Healthy Children}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Pulse oximetry, a ubiquitous, noninvasive method to monitor
   oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), requires larger, nonportable equipment.
   Smartphone pulse oximeter applications (apps) provide a portable,
   cost-effective option, but are untested in children. We hypothesize that
   smartphone pulse oximetry will not be inferior to standard pulse
   oximetry measured in healthy children.Materials and Methods:Two main
   types of pulse oximetry apps, a camera-based app (CBA) that uses a phone
   camera flash and lens and a probe-based app (PBA) that uses an external
   plug-in probe, were compared with standard pulse oximetry measured in
   children ages 2-13 years without a respiratory complaint and a triage
   SpO(2) 97\% seen in a pediatric Emergency Department. Two investigators
   obtained heart rate and SpO(2) using each app. Inter-rater reliability
   was tested using interclass correlations (ICCs), and Bland-Altman method
   was used to compare app values to triage measurements.Results:Eighty-one
   patients were enrolled. ICC for SpO(2) for PBA and CBA were 0.73 and
   -0.24, respectively. The 95\% limits of agreement between the PBA SpO(2)
   and triage SpO(2) were -2.8 to +2.5 compared with -4.1 to +3.5 for the
   CBA SpO(2) and triage SpO(2). Mean differences between triage SpO(2) and
   the PBA SpO(2) (-0.17\%) and triage SpO(2) and CBA SpO(2) (-0.33\%) were
   not statistically significant.Discussion and
   Conclusions:Smartphone-based pulse oximetry is not inferior to standard
   pulse oximetry in pediatric patients without hypoxia. Reliability was
   superior for PBA compared with CBA, with more precise agreement for the
   PBA compared with the CBA. Future studies should test pulse oximetry
   apps in a hypoxic pediatric population.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing use of clinical genomics to guide cancer treatment
   and management, there is a rise in the identification of germline cancer
   predisposition syndromes and a critical need for patients with germline
   findings to be referred for surveillance and care. The University of
   Chicago Hematopoietic Malignancies Cancer Risk Team has established a
   unique approach to patient care for individuals with hereditary
   hematologic malignancies through close communication and coordination
   between our pediatric and adult programs. Dedicated program members,
   including physicians, nurses, genetic counselors, and clinical research
   assistants, screen individuals for cancer predisposition at initial
   diagnosis through survivorship, in addition to testing individuals with
   an established family history of a cancer predisposition syndrome.
   Sample procurement, such as a skin biopsy at the time of bone marrow
   aspirate/biopsy in individuals with a positive screen, has facilitated
   timely identification of clinical germline findings or has served as a
   pipeline for translational research. Our integrated translational
   research program has led to the identification of novel syndromes in
   collaboration with other investigators, which have been incorporated
   iteratively into our clinical pipeline. Individuals are referred for
   clinical assessment based on personal and family history, identification
   of variants in susceptibility genes via molecular tumor testing, and
   during evaluation for matched related allogeneic stem cell
   transplantation. Upon referral, genetic counseling incorporates
   education with mindfulness of the psychosocial issues surrounding
   germline testing at different ages. The training and role of genetic
   counselors continues to grow, with the discovery of new predisposition
   syndromes, in the age of improved molecular diagnostics and new models
   for service delivery, such as telemedicine. With the identification of
   new syndromes that may predispose individuals to hematologic
   malignancies, surveillance guidelines will continue to evolve and may
   differ between children and adults. Thus, utilizing a collaborative
   approach between the pediatric and adult oncology programs facilitates
   care within families and optimizes the diagnosis and care of individuals
   with cancer predisposition syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{Background.- Teledermatology is currently booming. Due to the shortage
   of dermatologists in hospitals access to dermatological consultations is
   very limited in some hospitals. We present our experience of
   collaboration between an expert center, the dermatology department of
   the Victor-Dupouy Hospital Centre in Argenteuil, and all medical
   structures under the Andre-Mignot Hospital in Versailles (CHV),
   including 2 prison medical centers (UCSA), traditional departments and
   emergency department.
   Patients and methods.- Teledermatology, developed in the form of
   tele-expertise, began at the UCSA in November 2013. This expertise was
   then extended in June 2014 to the Internal Medicine department of CHV,
   and in December 2014 to all departments, including the emergency
   department. The rules and ethics of teledermatology were strictly
   adhered to. While UCSA could file all expertise dossiers, only urgent or
   difficult cases could be filed by other CHV departments.
   Results.- In 26 months, 347 expertise requests were filed: 231 by
   prisons and 116 by the other departments of the CHV. No patients refused
   teledermatology. The quality of information and photographs was
   considered good or excellent in over 95\% of cases. A response was given
   within 3hours in more than 50\% of cases and in all cases within 24hours
   (on working days). Analysis of diseases diagnosed illustrates the wide
   variety of conditions encountered in dermatology, with different
   structures having their own specific features.
   Conclusion.- Our example illustrates the possibility of developing such
   an inter-hospital platform. However, it does not yet cater for requests
   made by patients to dermatologists, by dermatologists to dermatologists,
   or by dermatologists to the hospital teledermatology department.
   Acceptability was considered excellent by patients (with no refusals),
   physicians at the CHV, and the expert center. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this study is to report the economic outcomes
   of a new synchronous telepractice service providing speech pathology
   intervention to patients with head and neck cancer at nonmetropolitan
   facilities.
   Methods: A multisite randomized controlled trial comparing standard care
   versus a new synchronous telepractice model was conducted within a large
   Australian public cancer service. Data pertaining to health service
   costs (staff wages, equipment, and patient travel reimbursement),
   patient +/- carer costs (travel and wages), and patient reported quality
   of life (Assessment of Quality of Life questionnaire 4D) were collected.
   Results: Eighty-two referrals (39 standard care and 43 synchronous
   telepractice care) were managed. The new telepractice service reported
   average cost savings of 12\% (P < .0058) for the health service and
   \$40.05 saving per patient per referral. An equivalent positive increase
   in quality of life (0.04) was reported for both groups.
   Conclusion: The synchronous telepractice service provides cost
   efficiencies over standard care for providing remote specialist speech

Abstract = {{The care of individuals with diabetic foot ulcers is costly and requires
   multiple hospital visits. Inadequate care leads to serious complications
   and a high risk of lower extremity amputation. In this review, we aimed
   at evaluating whether telemedicine can be effective in diabetic foot
   patient care. We searched Medline through Embase and PubMed and Cochrane
   Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant studies,
   published up to April 2017. The studies were summarized and discussed in
   a narrative method and a meta-analysis of 2 controlled trials was
   conducted using the fixed-effects model. The main outcomes, assessed in
   the retrieved studies were the healing rate and satisfaction of patients
   and health care personnel. Most of the studies showed that implementing
   telemonitoring programs increased the rate of complete ulcer healing,
   while the patients were highly satisfied. Two trials providing data on
   213 patients on telemedicine and 301 patients on usual care were
   included for meta-analysis. Subjects in telemedicine, as well as control
   groups had statistically similar healing time (43 vs 45 days; P =.83),
   healing time ratio adjusted for age (1 vs 1.4; P =.1), unhealed ulcers
   or loss to follow-up (3 of 20 vs 7 of 120; P =.13), and amputations (12
   of 193 vs 14 of 182; P =.59). Subjects in the telemedicine group
   experienced a significantly higher mortality rate (8 of 193 vs 1 of 181;
   P =.0001) due to unexplained factors. No adverse events were attributed
   to using the telemedicine technology. The odds of complete ulcer healing
   were statistically similar between the telemedicine group and controls
   (odds ratio = 0.86; 95\% CI = 0.57-1.33; P =.53). Telemedicine care is
   promising for the management of diabetic foot patients as the results
   were comparable with usual care. However, further large-scale studies
   need to be undertaken before it can be implemented widely.}},

   growing within mobile health (mHealth) and telemedicine, encouraged by
   institutions and industries. The idea is to improve lifestyle habits and
   health behaviors as a preventive goal in an aging population with fewer
   physicians available. However, their ill-defined place in health care
   does not promote their use in current medical practice.
   Objective: The primary objective of this study was to quantify CHDs' use
   rate by general practitioners (GPs). A secondary objective was to
   evaluate their benefits and limitations in usual care.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study through an Internet-based survey was
   addressed to French GPs via regional medical unions and continuous
   education agencies, supplemented with an informative website, from March
   2015 to July 2015. Surveys where either the form was insufficiently
   filled or the main question was left unanswered were excluded from the
   study.
   Results: A total of 1084 answers were analyzed, of which 19.46\%
   (211/1084, 95\% CI 17.1-21.8) GPs used CHDs, and 10.15\% (110/1084, 95\%
   CI 8.5-12.1) prescribed a CHD. CHD users statistically prescribed more
   CHDs (7.38\% {[}80/1084] in the user group vs 2.86\% {[}31/1084] in
   nonusers; P< .001) and were more likely to use them in the future. Major
   interests in their utilization were in patient monitoring for 84.96\%
   (921/1084) and patient education for 75.83\% (822/1084), especially for
   diabetes (89.67\%, 972/1084) and hypertension (84.13\%, 912/1084).
   Generated data had to be managed securely by the patient primarily for
   85.79\% (930/1084) of the GPs. CHDs had to not constrain GPs outside
   clinical consultation, nor restrain their time for 75.83\% (822/1084).
   Additional actors in patient care were not desired for 79.98\%
   (867/1084) of the GPs. Questions about data management issues and
   technical difficulties were raised.
   Conclusions: CHDs are little used by French GPs and even less prescribed
   to their patients, as only a few GPs use these tools. Their benefits as
   tools of patient empowerment, although expected, remain to be
   demonstrated in real-life setups.}},

   Weight Loss Apps: Mixed-Method Analysis}},
Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},

Abstract = {{Background: Significant weight loss takes several months to achieve, and
   behavioral support can enhance weight loss success. Weight loss apps
   could provide ongoing support and deliver innovative interventions, but
   to do so, developers must ensure user satisfaction.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a review of Google Play
   Store apps to explore what users like and dislike about weight loss and
   weight-tracking apps and to examine qualitative feedback through
   analysis of user reviews.
   Methods: The Google Play Store was searched and screened for weight loss
   apps using the search terms weight loss and weight track{*}, resulting
   in 179 mobile apps. A content analysis was conducted based on the Oxford
   Food and Activity Behaviors taxonomy. Correlational analyses were used
   to assess the association between complexity of mobile health (mHealth)
   apps and popularity indicators. The sample was then screened for popular
   apps that primarily focus on weight-tracking. For the resulting subset
   of 15 weight-tracking apps, 569 user reviews were sampled from the
   Google Play Store. Framework and thematic analysis of user reviews was
   conducted to assess which features users valued and how design
   influenced users' responses.
   Results: The complexity (number of components) of weight loss apps was
   significantly positively correlated with the rating (r = .25; P = .001),
   number of reviews (r = .28; P < .001), and number of downloads (r = .48;
   P < .001) of the app. In contrast, in the qualitative analysis of
   weight-tracking apps, users expressed preference for simplicity and ease
   of use. In addition, we found that positive reinforcement through
   detailed feedback fostered users' motivation for further weight loss.
   Smooth functioning and reliable data storage emerged as critical
   prerequisites for long-term app usage.
   Conclusions: Users of weight-tracking apps valued simplicity, whereas
   users of comprehensive weight loss apps appreciated availability of more
   features, indicating that complexity demands are specific to different
   target populations. The provision of feedback on progress can motivate
   users to continue their weight loss attempts. Users value seamless
   functioning and reliable data storage.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial mobile apps for health behavior change are flourishing in the
   marketplace, but little evidence exists to support their use. This paper
   summarizes methods for evaluating the content, usability, and efficacy
   of commercially available health apps. Content analyses can be used to
   compare app features with clinical guidelines, evidence-based protocols,
   and behavior change techniques. Usability testing can establish how well
   an app functions and serves its intended purpose for a target
   population. Observational studies can explore the association between
   use and clinical and behavioral outcomes. Finally, efficacy testing can
   establish whether a commercial app impacts an outcome of interest via a
   variety of study designs, including randomized trials, multiphase
   optimization studies, and N-of-1 studies. Evidence in all these forms
   would increase adoption of commercial apps in clinical practice, inform
   the development of the next generation of apps, and ultimately increase
   the impact of commercial apps.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mobile apps hold promise for serving as a lifestyle
   intervention in public health to promote wellness and attenuate chronic
   conditions, yet little is known about how individuals with chronic
   illness use or perceive mobile apps.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to explore behaviors and
   perceptions about mobile phone-based apps for health among individuals
   with chronic conditions.
   Methods: Data were collected from a national cross-sectional survey of
   1604 mobile phone users in the United States that assessed mHealth use,
   beliefs, and preferences. This study examined health app use, reason for
   download, and perceived efficacy by chronic condition.
   Results: Among participants, having between 1 and 5 apps was reported by
   38.9\% (314/807) of respondents without a condition and by 6.6\%
   (24/364) of respondents with hypertension. Use of health apps was
   reported 2 times or more per day by 21.3\% (172/807) of respondents
   without a condition, 2.7\% (10/364) with hypertension, 13.1\% (26/198)
   with obesity, 12.3\% (20/163) with diabetes, 12.0\% (32/267) with
   depression, and 16.6\% (53/319) with high cholesterol. Results of the
   logistic regression did not indicate a significant difference in health
   app download between individuals with and without chronic conditions
   (P>.05). Compared with individuals with poor health, health app download
   was more likely among those with self-reported very good health (odds
   ratio {[}OR] 3.80, 95\% CI 2.38-6.09, P < .001) and excellent health (OR
   4.77, 95\% CI 2.70-8.42, P < .001). Similarly, compared with individuals
   who report never or rarely engaging in physical activity, health app
   download was more likely among those who report exercise 1 day per week
   (OR 2.47, 95\% CI 1.6-3.83, P < .001), 2 days per week (OR 4.77, 95\% CI
   3.27-6.94, P < .001), 3 to 4 days per week (OR 5.00, 95\% CI 3.52-7.10,
   P < .001), and 5 to 7 days per week (OR 4.64, 95\% CI 3.11-6.92, P <
   .001). All logistic regression results controlled for age, sex, and race
   or ethnicity.
   Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that individuals with poor
   self-reported health and low rates of physical activity, arguably those
   who stand to benefit most from health apps, were least likely to report
   download and use these health tools.}},

Title = {{A Smartphone App to Reduce Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Consumption Among
   Young Adults in Australian Remote Indigenous Communities: Design,
   Formative Evaluation and User-Testing}},
Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},

Abstract = {{Background: The disproportionate burden of noncommunicable disease among
   Indigenous Australians living in remote Indigenous communities (RICs) is
   a complex and persistent problem. Smartphones are increasingly being
   used by young Indigenous adults and therefore represent a promising
   method to engage them in programs seeking to improve nutritional intake.
   Objective: This study aimed to consult RIC members to inform the content
   of a smartphone app that can be used to monitor and reduce
   sugar-sweetened beverage intake in RICs.
   Methods: The study was conducted in two phases. The formative phase
   involved a simulated grocery selection activity with think aloud
   ({''}think aloud shop{''}), a semistructured interview, a questionnaire
   outlining current smartphone and app use, and a paper prototyping
   activity. A preliminary end-user testing phase involved a think aloud
   prototype test and a semistructured interview regarding user
   satisfaction. Convenience sampling was used to recruit 20 18-to
   35-year-old smartphone users for each phase from two RICs in the
   Northern Territory, Australia. Thematic analysis of transcribed audio
   recordings was used to identify determinants of food choice from the
   think aloud shop; themes related to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)
   from the eating behaviors interview; and usability, comprehension, and
   satisfaction with the app from the preliminary end-user testing.
   Results: Smartphone use in RICs is currently different to that found in
   urban environments; in particular, extremely low use of Facebook,
   restricted variety of phone types, and limited Internet access. Findings
   regarding promoting app engagement indicate that utilizing an opt-in
   approach to social features such as leader boards and team challenges is
   essential. The inclusion of games was also shown to be important for
   satisfaction, as were the use of audio features, contextually embedded
   dissemination, and streamlined app design for comprehension in this
   target group.
   Conclusions: This research provides critical insights and concrete
   recommendations for the development of lifestyle improvement apps
   targeted toward disadvantaged young adults in nonurban settings,
   specifically RICs. It serves as a framework for future app development
   projects using a consultative user-centered design approach, supporting
   calls for the increased use of this strategy in app development.}},

   2000 to April 2017 in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central
   Register of Controlled Trials. Risk of bias was assessed using the
   Cochrane Collaboration tool. Study characteristics, intervention
   characteristics, and outcome data were extracted. Studies were sorted
   based on their comparison group. A best-evidence synthesis was conducted
   to summarize the effectiveness.
   Results: A total of 25 out of the 29 included studies were of high
   quality. Most studies (n=21; 72\%) compared a blended intervention with
   no intervention. The majority of interventions focused on changing pain
   behavior (n=17; 59\%), and the other interventions focused on lifestyle
   change (n=12; 41\%). In addition, 26 studies (90\%) focused on one type
   of behavior, whereas 3 studies (10\%) focused on multiple behaviors. A
   total of 23 studies (79\%) mentioned a theory as basis for the
   intervention. The therapeutic guidance in most studies (n=18; 62\%) was
   non face-to-face by using email, phone, or videoconferencing, and in the
   other studies (partly), it was face-to-face (n=11; 38\%). In 26 studies
   (90\%), the online care was provided via a website, and in 3 studies
   (10\%) via an app. In 22 studies (76\%), the therapeutic guidance and
   online care were integrated instead of two separate aspects. A total of
   26 outcome measures were included in the evidence synthesis comparing
   blended interventions with no intervention: for the coping strategy
   catastrophizing, we found strong evidence for a significant effect. In
   addition, 1 outcome measure was included in the evidence synthesis
   comparing blended interventions with face-to-face interventions, but no
   evidence for a significant effect was found. A total of 6 outcome
   measures were included in the evidence synthesis comparing blended
   interventions with online interventions, but no evidence for a
   significant effect was found.
   Conclusions: Blended behavior change interventions for patients with
   chronic somatic disorders show variety in the type of therapeutic
   guidance, the type of online care, and how these two delivery modes are
   integrated. The evidence of the effectiveness of blended interventions
   is inconsistent and nonsignificant for most outcome measures. Future
   research should focus on which type of blended intervention works for
   whom.}},

Title = {{A 6-Week Web-Based Osteoarthritis Treatment Program: Observational
   Quasi-Experimental Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common causes of
   disability, with a burden of disease estimated to increase over time.
   Joint Academy, a Web-based treatment for individuals with clinically
   verified knee or hip OA, was developed to increase access to and
   facilitate implementation of evidence-based nonsurgical OA treatment in
   accordance with international guidelines.
   Objective: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate joint pain,
   physical function, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) over time
   of users of the Joint Academy program.
   Methods: We enrolled 350 patients who were recruited online and
   completed the initial health journal in the 6-week program. We asked
   patients to complete an eHealth journal and e-questionnaires, including
   pain level assessed by a numerical rating scale, as well as a physical
   function evaluation using the 30-second chair-stand test. In addition,
   we assessed HRQoL using the 3-level version of the EQ-5D. We also asked
   participants whether they experienced difficulty walking and were afraid
   of physical activity due to their OA and their desire for surgery. We
   collected descriptive data and compared pre-versus postintervention
   data. As a reference group, we included results retrieved from the
   Swedish well-structured face-to-face self-supportive OA management
   program Better Management of Patients With Osteoarthritis (BOA).
   Results: Of the study cohort (n=350 patients; 239 women, mean age 62
   years, mean body mass index 27 kg/m2), 71.4\% (n=250) completed the
   program and were included in the study. We used the questionnaires to
   secure a clinical diagnosis of OA and to establish baseline study
   values. After 6 weeks of treatment, the change in mean numerical rating
   scale was larger than the minimal clinical difference (5.4 vs 4.1;
   P<.001), while physical function increased (from 10.88 to 13.14;
   P<.001). The percentage of participants having walking difficulties
   decreased from 81.7\% (196/240) to 62.1\% (149/240; P<.001), those
   afraid of being physically active decreased from 22.1\% (53/240) to
   6.7\% (16/240; P<.001), and 22.0\% (55/250) reported that they had
   reduced the amount of OA-related medication. After 6 weeks, 24\% (13/54)
   of those desiring surgery at the start of the program were no longer
   interested. In addition, the comparison between Joint Academy and the
   BOA program showed similar levels of pain at 3 months, but suggested
   greater reduction with the use of Joint Academy due to a higher level of
   pain at baseline.
   Conclusions: The reported data suggest that participation in Joint
   Academy is associated with a clinically relevant decrease in pain and an
   increase in physical function and HRQoL, as well as a decreasing fear of
   physical activity. This innovative Web-based OA treatment is scalable,
   is population specific, and can reach a large number of individuals with
   impaired joints who have Internet access.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We evaluate the need for, feasibility of, and impediments to
   improving hematopathology diagnoses for cancer hospitals in Vietnam.
   Methods: Two hematopathologists from the United States visited three
   major cancer treatment hospitals in Vietnam to workshop a sampling of
   difficult hematopathology cases. With Vietnamese pathologists, they
   toured histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and ancillary laboratory
   facilities.
   Results: Automated tissue processors and slide staining equipment were
   documented for each of the three hospitals. Between seven and 11
   hematopathology cases were reviewed for each hospital. Exact/complete
   diagnostic concordance was 50\% or less for all three laboratories. The
   major impediments to accurate specific diagnoses were limitations of
   immunohistochemical stains, limited stains available in house, and, for
   one of the hospitals, difficulty with interpretation of the
   immunohistochemistry.
   Conclusions: Vietnamese pathologists would benefit from hematopathology
   training or opportunities to consult with hematopathologists in the
   United States. Expert hematopathology consultation services are
   currently unavailable within Vietnam, as postgraduate training for
   laboratory physicians consists of residency training in anatomic
   pathology only. Limitations in the quality of histopathology and
   immunohistochemistry could impose a barrier to success of efforts to
   improve hematopathology diagnosis. Implementation of a histopathology
   and immunohistochemistry quality improvement program might overcome this
   limitation.}},

Volume = {{79}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives Information and communication technologies are becoming
   increasingly important in health care. Randomized clinical trials have
   shown that telemonitoring in particular leads to improved quality of
   care as well as shortened hospital stays and reduced health care costs.
   For its long-term anchoring in medical care, user-oriented technology
   needs to be developed, taking into account the complex structures of
   technology acceptance
   Methods Knowledge of and attitudes towards telemonitoring amongst
   medical professionals were investigated using an online-based approach
   with a random sample of n = 614; the response rate was 21 \% (n = 133).
   The emergence of positive attitude patterns towards telemonitoring was
   analyzed using the relationships between psychological and
   technology-related personality traits, and perceived knowledge was
   determined using a regression model.
   Results Positive attitudes towards telemonitoring are significantly
   influenced by the individual's knowledge and agreeableness, which is
   strongly characterized by altruistic traits and interpersonal trust.
   There is a strong association with an improvement in the quality of
   care, while there are differences in attitudes towards telemonitoring
   between health care sectors and gender. Overall, only 57 \% of the
   physicians surveyed feel sufficiently informed about the use of
   telemonitoring.
   Conclusion Medical evidence is crucial for the further development of
   telemedicine in general and telemonitoring in particular. Improvements
   need to be made in knowledge transfer, the exchange of best practice
   solutions and the anchoring of telemedicine in education and training.}},

Abstract = {{The term ``digitalhealth{''} is currently the most comprehensive term
   that includes all information and communication technologies in
   healthcare, including e-health, mobile health, telemedicine, big data,
   health apps and others. Digital health can be seen as a good example of
   the use of the concept and methodology of health services research in
   the interaction between complex interventions and complex contexts. The
   position paper deals with 1) digital health as the subject of health
   services research; 2) digital health as a methodological and ethical
   challenge for health services research. The often-postulated benefits of
   digital health interventions should be demonstrated with good studies.
   First systematic evaluations of apps for ``treatment support{''} show
   that risks are higher than benefits. The need for a rigorous proof
   applies even more to big data-assisted interventions that support
   decision-making in the treatment process with the support of artificial
   intelligence. Of course, from the point of view of health services
   research, it is worth participating as much as possible in data access
   available through digital health and ``big data{''}. However, there is
   the risk that a noncritical application of digital health and big data
   will lead to a return to a linear understanding of biomedical research,
   which, at best, accepts complex conditions assuming multivariate models
   but does not take complex facts into account. It is not just a matter of
   scientific ethical requirements in health services care research, for
   instance, better research instead of unnecessary research ({''}reducing
   waste{''}), but it is primarily a matter of anticipating the social
   consequences (system level) of scientific analysis and evaluation. This
   is both a challenge and an attractive option for health services
   research to present itself as a mature and responsible scientific
   discipline.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The number of patients living with cancer is growing, and a
   substantial number of patients suffer from psychological distress.
   Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) seem effective in alleviating
   psychological distress. Unfortunately, several cancer patients find it
   difficult, if not impossible, to attend a group-based course.
   Internet-based MBIs (eMBIs) such as Internet-based mindfulness-based
   cognitive therapy (eMBCT) may offer solutions. However, it is yet to be
   studied what facilitators and barriers cancer patients experience during
   eMBCT.
   Objective: This study aimed to explore facilitators and barriers of
   individual asynchronous therapist-assisted eMBCT as experienced by both
   patients and therapists.
   Methods: Patients with heterogeneous cancer diagnoses suffering from
   psychological distress were offered eMBCT. This 9-week intervention
   mirrored the group-based MBCT protocol and included weekly asynchronous
   written therapist feedback. Patients were granted access to a website
   that contained the eMBCT protocol and a secured inbox, and they were
   asked to practice and fill out diaries on which the therapist provided
   feedback. In total, 31 patients participated in an individual
   posttreatment interview on experienced facilitators and barriers during
   eMBCT. Moreover, eight therapists were interviewed. The data were
   analyzed with qualitative content analysis to identify barriers and
   facilitators in eMBCT.
   Results: Both patients and therapists mentioned four overarching themes
   as facilitators and barriers: treatment setting (the individual and
   Internet-based nature of the treatment), treatment format (how the
   treatment and its guidance were organized and delivered), role of the
   therapist, and individual patient characteristics.
   Conclusions: The eMBCT provided flexibility in when, where, and how
   patients and therapists engage in MBCT. Future studies should assess how
   different eMBCT designs could further improve barriers that were found.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The increase of chronic diseases prevalence has created the
   need to adapt care models and to provide greater home supervision.
   Objective: The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of
   telemonitoring on patients with long-term conditions at high risk for
   rehospitalization or an emergency department visit, in terms of target
   disease control (diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease).
   Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental study with a before-and-after
   analysis to assess the effectiveness of the ValCronic program after 1
   year of primary care monitoring. The study included high-risk patients
   with 1 or more of the following conditions: diabetes, high blood
   pressure, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We
   assessed risk according to the Community Assessment Risk Screen.
   Participants used an electronic device (tablet) to self-report relevant
   health information, which was then automatically entered into their
   eHealth record for consultation.
   Results: The total sample size was 521 patients. Compared with the
   preintervention year, there were significant reductions in weight (82.3
   kg before vs 80.1 kg after; P=.001) and in the proportion of people with
   high systolic (>= 140 mmHg; 190, 36.5\% vs 170, 32.6\%; P=.001) and
   diastolic (>= 90 mmHg; 72, 13.8\% vs 40, 7.7\%; P=.01) blood pressures,
   and hemoglobin A(1c) >= 8\% (186, 35.7\% vs 104, 20.0\%; P=.001). There
   was also a decrease in the proportion of participants who used emergency
   services in primary care (68, 13.1\% vs 33, 6.3\%; P<.001) and in
   hospital (98, 18.8\% vs 67, 12.8\%; P<.001). Likewise, fewer
   participants required hospital admission due to an emergency (105,
   20.2\% vs 71, 13.6\%; P<.001) or disease exacerbation (55, 10.5\% vs 42,

Abstract = {{Purpose: Our objective was to assess how telephonic review of
   outpatients with stable epilepsy compared with conventional face-to-face
   clinic management.
   Methods: We constructed a randomized parallel group study of suitable
   patients attending our Epilepsy Clinic and compared telephonic review
   with conventional clinic visit based management. Primary outcomes were
   the percentage of patients with breakthrough seizures and total number
   of breakthrough seizures. We also compared cost, patient satisfaction
   and numbers defaulting.
   Results: A total of 465 patients were randomized and 429 were included
   in the final analysis. There was no significant difference in
   breakthrough seizures between the two groups. Mean time spent in the
   consultation was 10 min in the telephone group (FT) and 22 h in the
   face-to-face group (FC) and cost was INR 865 more expensive on an
   average in the FC group. Satisfaction was over 90\% in the FT group.
   Significantly more people in the FC group were lost to follow-up.
   Conclusion: This study provides Class I evidence that the number of
   stable epilepsy patients who have breakthrough seizures and the total
   number of breakthrough seizures remain the same irrespective of whether
   patients are reviewed telephonically or face-to-face in the clinic.
   Clinicians managing epilepsy patients should consider using telephonic
   review for selected patients. Telephonic reviews have the potential of
   effectively reducing the secondary treatment gap in millions of patients
   who do not have easy access to doctors. (C) 2017 British Epilepsy

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To report clinical feasibility of
   non-mydriatic ultra-widefield (NMUWF) imaging and determine the
   prevalence of peripheral retinal pathology in comparison to standard
   single-field imaging in a primary care setting.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six hundred and thirty-two subjects (1,260 eyes)
   who underwent NMUWF imaging during annual health screening from October
   2015 through March 2016 were retrospectively identified. An automated
   algorithm processed the raw images into: (1) NMUWF image with mask/grid
   outline that delineates the center 45 degrees field simulating standard
   single-field photograph and (2) single-field image comprising 45 degrees
   posterior pole extracted from the corresponding NMUWF image.
   RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 59.6 years +/- 7.5 years. Of the 1,260
   eyes, 1,238 eyes (98.3\%) were considered optimum for grading. NMUWF
   images detected peripheral retinal pathology in 228 eyes (18.4\%) that
   were not visible on corresponding single-field images.
   CONCLUSIONS: NMUWF imaging is feasible in a primary care setting, allows
   improved visualization of peripheral retinal pathology, and may
   therefore be useful for telemedicine screening.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To report the 4-year outcomes of a neonatal
   ophthalmic screening program in the Kunming Maternity and Child Care
   Hospital of Kunming City, Kunming, China.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational case
   series study. Newborns who underwent neonatal eye screening using the
   RetCam system (Clarity Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA) at the authors'
   hospital from March 2010 to February 2014 were included.
   RESULTS: Of the 15,284 full-term infants who participated in the
   program, 21\% (3,171 of 15,284) had some ocular abnormalities. Among
   these abnormalities, retinal hemorrhage was the most frequent finding,
   accounting for 19\% (2,899 of 15,284) of all cases. Other anomalies were
   found in 2\% (272 of 15,284) of the cases. No major ocular or systemic
   complications were found to be associated with the screening process.
   CONCLUSION: Overall, 21\% of the newborns who underwent the eye
   screening program were found to have an abnormality. The use of the

Abstract = {{Technological innovations in the fields of medical imaging and

   transforming the usual caring relationship, dental telemedicine
   virtualizes the medical procedure and generates a mutation of the

   the dentist and the patient. It introduces a positive lever that must
   stay up to the appraisal of the benefit-risk equation, that an ethical
   questioning will help to evaluate for every patient. Dental telemedicine
   must be understood as a mean, and not as an end. It must not be
   fantasized as a universal dental care model. It seems to be recommanded
   to investigate systematically the technological innovations and the
   development of protocols thanks to ethical guidelines in order to
   evaluate a priori and a posteriori any kind of progress that might be

Abstract = {{Ischemic stroke results from blocked arteries in the brain, with earlier
   thrombolysis with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and/or
   mechanical thrombectomy resulting in improved clinical outcomes. Mobile
   Stroke Unit (MSU) can speed up the treatment with tPA and facilitate
   faster triage for patients to hospitals for mechanical thrombectomy. The
   first registry-based MSU study in Germany demonstrated faster treatment
   times with tPA using a MSU, a higher proportion of patients being
   treated within the first ``golden hour,{''} and a suggestion of improved
   3-month clinical outcomes. The first multicenter, prospective,
   randomized clinical trial comparing MSU versus standard care was started
   in 2014 after the launch of the MSU in Houston, TX, demonstrating the
   feasibility and safety of MSU operation in the United States, and
   reliability of telemedicine to evaluate stroke patients for tPA
   eligibility. Although conclusive evidence from clinical trials to
   support MSUs as being cost effective and improving clinical outcomes is
   still needed, there are a myriad of other clinical and research
   applications of MSUs that could have profound implications for managing

Abstract = {{There is an increasing need to produce veterinarians with knowledge and
   critical thinking skills that will allow them to participate in
   veterinary global health equity delivery, particularly in the developing
   world, where many people remain dependent on animal-based agriculture
   for a living. This need for veterinarians trained in global health is
   reflected by the demand among students for greater exposure and
   education. At the same time, many students are held back from on-site
   training in global health due to constraints of cost, time, or family
   obligations. The purpose of this article is to describe the use of a
   telemedicine approach to educating veterinary students at Tufts Cummings
   School of Veterinary Medicine. This approach simultaneously provides
   expert consultation and support for a pro bono hospital in the
   developing world. The development of a telemedicine teaching service is
   discussed, from initial ad hoc email consultation among friends and
   associates to a more formal use of store-and-forward delivery of data
   along with real-time videoconferencing on a regular basis, termed
   tele-rounds. The practicalities of data delivery and exchange and best
   use of available bandwidth are also discussed, as this very mundane
   information is critical to efficient and useful tele-rounds. Students
   are able to participate in discussion of cases that they would never see
   in their usual clinical sphere and to become familiar with diagnostic
   and treatment approaches to these cases. By having the patient
   ``virtually{''} brought to us, tele-rounds also decrease the usual
   carbon footprint of global health delivery.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Some proponents of telemedicine screening for retinopathy of
   prematurity (ROP) believe that a screening system based on the
   characteristics of posterior pole vessels is sufficient for identifying
   infants needing treatment.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the vascular characteristics present when
   treatment was determined to be needed and the number of days from the
   last examination when the vessels of both eyes were noted to be normal
   until a decision was made to treat.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective study included all
   infants who underwent longitudinal examination and treatment for ROP in
   the neonatal intensive care unit at an academic medical center, Duke
   University, from June 22, 2013, through May 2, 2017.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Vascular characteristics present on clinical
   examination when an infant was determined to need treatment and the
   number of days from the last examination when the vessels of both eyes
   were noted to be normal until a decision was made to treat.
   RESULTS Fifty-five infants (30 male and 25 female) met eligibility
   criteria, with a mean birthweight of 733 g (range, 420-1060 g), mean
   gestational age of 25.1 weeks (range, 22.9-27.7 weeks), and mean
   postmenstrual age when a decision was made to treat of 36.7 weeks
   (range, 31.4-43.0 weeks). When an infant was determined to need
   treatment, 51 (93\%) had plus disease; 3 (5\%), preplus disease; and 1
   (2\%), neither. The number of days from the last examination when an
   infant was noted to have normal vessels bilaterally until a decision was
   made to treat ranged from 0 to 49 days. The interval was at least 14
   days for 42 infants (76\%) and at least 7 days for all but 1 infant
   (98\%). The exception was an infant with the rare scenario of neither
   preplus nor plus disease with zone I, stage 3 ROP (type 1 ROP) at the
   time when the examiner decided to treat.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE At the time when infants were determined to
   need treatment for ROP, all but 1 had preplus or plus disease. These
   results suggest that narrow-field imaging for ROP screening should
   include all of zone I to identify the rare treatment-requiring ROP with
   normal posterior pole vessels. If confirmed, with sufficient image
   quality, weekly photographic screening of zone I likely should capture
   changes indicative of impending ROP requiring treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Surgical and nonsurgical specialists are highly centralized,
   making access to high-quality care difficult for many Americans. We
   explored the feasibility, benefits, preliminary outcomes, and patient
   satisfaction with a new type of health visit, in which a surgical
   oncologist used video telecommunication to manage and treat complex
   cancer diseases, including patients with severe comorbidities.
   Materials and methods: Patients visited local VA medical centers
   throughout Florida to engage in video telecommunication visits with a
   centralized surgical oncologist in Miami, who directed their oncology
   treatment. The average length of stay and rate of unplanned readmission
   were calculated within each organ. The total mileage saved was
   calculated by subtracting the distance between the patient's home
   address and the local VA from the distance between the patient's home
   address and the Miami VA. Travel costs were determined by the VA's
   reimbursement of \$0.415/mile for health-related travel and
   reimbursement of \$150.00 for an overnight hotel stay. A Likert scale
   with both positively and negatively keyed questions was used to assess
   patient satisfaction.
   Results: In 24 mo, seven unplanned readmissions occurred among 195
   operations. Patients experienced an 80.7\% reduction in travel distance
   and saved a total of 213,007.58 miles by visiting their local VA instead
   of the Miami VA. Survey results indicate that 86\% of patients believed
   that the telemedicine program made medical care more accessible.
   Conclusions: The Specialist-Directed Telemedicine Model can save
   patients substantial time and money by not traveling to centralized
   areas, while delivering greater continuity of care and patient
   satisfaction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of telecommunications and information systems in health
   care first began 4 decades ago with 500 patient consultations performed
   via interactive television. The use of telemedicine services and
   technology to deliver health care at a distance is increasing
   exponentially. Concomitant with this rapid expansion is the exciting
   ability to provide enhancements in quality and safety of care.
   Telemedicine enables increased access to care, improvement in health
   outcomes, reduction in medical costs, better resource use, expanded
   educational opportunities, and enhanced collaboration between patients
   and physicians. These potential benefits should be weighed against the
   risks and challenges of using telemedicine. The American College of
   Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology advocates for incorporation of
   meaningful and sustained use of telemedicine in allergy and immunology
   practice. This article serves to offer policy and position statements of
   the use of telemedicine pertinent to the allergy and immunology

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Advances in smartphone photography (both quality and image
   transmission) may improve access to care via direct parent-to-clinician
   telemedicine. However, the accuracy of diagnoses that are reliant on
   parent-provided photographs has not been formally compared with
   diagnoses made in person.
   OBJECTIVE To assess whether smartphone photographs of pediatric skin
   conditions taken by parents are of sufficient quality to permit accurate
   diagnosis.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective studywas conducted among
   40 patient-parent dyads at a pediatric dermatology clinic at the
   Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from March 1 to September 30, 2016,
   to assess concordance between diagnoses made by an independent pediatric
   dermatologist based on in-person examination and those based on parental
   photographs. Half of the patient-parent dyads were randomized for a
   secondary analysis to receive instructions on how best to take
   photographs with smartphones. Clinicians were blinded to whether parents
   had received photography instructions.
   EXPOSURES Half of the patient-parent dyads received a simple, 3-step
   instruction sheet on how best to take photographs using a smartphone
   (intervention group); the other half did not (control group).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Concordance between photograph-based vs
   in-person diagnosis in the intervention vs control groups, as quantified
   using Cohen., a measure of interrater agreement that takes into account
   the possibility of agreement occurring by chance.
   RESULTS Among the 40 patient-parent dyads (22 female children and 18
   male children; mean {[}SD] age, 6.96 {[}5.23] years), overall
   concordance between photograph-based vs in-person diagnosis was
   83\%(95\% CI, 71\%-94\%;. = 0.81). Diagnostic concordance was 89\% (95\%
   CI, 75\%-97\%;. = 0.88) in a subgroup of 37 participants with
   photographs considered of high enough quality to make a diagnosis. No
   statistically significant effect of photography instructions on
   concordance was detected (group that received instructions, 85\%; group
   that did not receive instructions, 80\%; P = .68). In cases of
   diagnostic disagreement, appropriate follow-up was suggested.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Parent-operated smartphone photography can
   accurately be used as amethod to provide pediatric dermatologic care.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Personal health record (PHR)-based health care management
   systems can improve patient engagement and data-driven medical diagnosis
   in a clinical setting.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was (1) to demonstrate the
   development of an electronic health record (EHR)-tethered PHR app named
   MyHealthKeeper, which can retrieve data from a wearable device and
   deliver these data to a hospital EHR system, and (2) to study the
   effectiveness of a PHR data-driven clinical intervention with clinical
   trial results.
   Methods: To improve the conventional EHR-tethered PHR, we ascertained
   clinicians' unmet needs regarding PHR functionality and the data
   frequently used in the field through a cocreation workshop. We
   incorporated the requirements into the system design and architecture of
   the MyHealthKeeper PHR module. We constructed the app and validated the
   effectiveness of the PHR module by conducting a 4-week clinical trial.
   We used a commercially available activity tracker (Misfit) to collect
   individual physical activity data, and developed the MyHealthKeeper
   mobile phone app to record participants' patterns of daily food intake
   and activity logs. We randomly assigned 80 participants to either the
   PHR-based intervention group (n=51) or the control group (n=29). All of
   the study participants completed a paper-based survey, a laboratory
   test, a physical examination, and an opinion interview. During the
   4-week study period, we collected health-related mobile data, and study
   participants visited the outpatient clinic twice and received PHR-based
   clinical diagnosis and recommendations.
   Results: A total of 68 participants (44 in the intervention group and 24
   in the control group) completed the study. The PHR intervention group
   showed significantly higher weight loss than the control group (mean 1.4
   kg, 95\% CI 0.9-1.9; P<.001) at the final week (week 4). In addition,
   triglyceride levels were significantly lower by the end of the study
   period (mean 2.59 mmol/L, 95\% CI 17.6-75.8; P=.002).
   Conclusions: We developed an innovative EHR-tethered PHR system that
   allowed clinicians and patients to share lifelog data. This study shows
   the effectiveness of a patient-managed and clinician-guided health
   tracker system and its potential to improve patient clinical profiles.}},

   Noncommunicable Chronic Disease Management in Young Adults: Systematic
   Review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as asthma,
   diabetes, cancer, and persistent musculoskeletal pain impose an
   escalating and unsustainable burden on young people, their families, and
   society. Exploring how mobile health (mHealth) technologies can support
   management for young people with NCDs is imperative.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify, appraise, and
   synthesize available qualitative evidence on users' experiences of
   mHealth technologies for NCD management in young people. We explored the
   perspectives of both end users (young people) and implementers (health
   policy makers, clinicians, and researchers).
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies.
   Eligibility criteria included full reports published in peer-reviewed
   journals from January 2007 to December 2016, searched across databases
   including EMBASE, MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and PsycINFO. All
   qualitative studies that evaluated the use of mHealth technologies to
   support young people (in the age range of 15-24 years) in managing their
   chronic NCDs were considered. Two independent reviewers identified
   eligible reports and conducted critical appraisal (based on the Joanna
   Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument:
   JBI-QARI). Three reviewers independently, then collaboratively,
   synthesized and interpreted data through an inductive and iterative
   process to derive emergent themes across the included data. External
   validity checking was undertaken by an expert clinical researcher and
   for relevant content, a health policy expert. Themes were subsequently
   subjected to a meta-synthesis, with findings compared and contrasted
   between user groups and policy and practice recommendations derived.
   Results: Twelve studies met our inclusion criteria. Among studies of end
   users (N=7), mHealth technologies supported the management of young
   people with diabetes, cancer, and asthma. Implementer studies (N=5)
   covered the management of cognitive and communicative disabilities,
   asthma, chronic self-harm, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
   Quality ratings were higher for implementer compared with end user
   studies. Both complementary and unique user themes emerged. Themes
   derived for end users of mHealth included (1) Experiences of
   functionality that supported self-management, (2) Acceptance (technical
   usability and feasibility), (3) Importance of codesign, and (4)
   Perceptions of benefit (self-efficacy and empowerment). For
   implementers, derived themes included (1) Characteristics that supported
   self-management (functional, technical, and behavior change); (2)
   Implementation challenges (systems level, service delivery level, and
   clinical level); (3) Adoption considerations for specific populations
   (training end users; specific design requirements); and (4) Codesign and
   tailoring to facilitate uptake and person-centered care.
   Conclusions: Synthesizing available data revealed both complementary and
   unique user perspectives on enablers and barriers to designing,
   developing, and implementing mHealth technologies to support young
   people's management of their chronic NCDs.}},

   Disease: Systematic Review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Telehealth-delivered dietary interventions are effective for
   chronic disease management and are an emerging area of clinical
   practice. However, to apply interventions from the research setting in
   clinical practice, health professionals need details of each
   intervention component.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the completeness of
   intervention reporting in published dietary chronic disease management
   trials that used telehealth delivery methods.
   Methods: Eligible randomized controlled trial publications were
   identified through a systematic review. The completeness of reporting of
   experimental and comparison interventions was assessed by two
   independent assessors using the Template for Intervention Description
   and Replication (TIDieR) checklist that consists of 12 items including
   intervention rationale, materials used, procedures, providers, delivery
   mode, location, when and how much intervention delivered, intervention
   tailoring, intervention modifications, and fidelity. Where reporting was
   incomplete, further information was sought from additional published
   material and through email correspondence with trial authors.
   Results: Within the 37 eligible trials, there were 49 experimental
   interventions and 37 comparison interventions. One trial reported every
   TIDieR item for their experimental intervention. No publications
   reported every item for the comparison intervention. For the
   experimental interventions, the most commonly reported items were
   location (96\%), mode of delivery (98\%), and rationale for the
   essential intervention elements (96\%). Least reported items for
   experimental interventions were modifications (2\%) and intervention
   material descriptions (39\%) and where to access them (20\%). Of the 37
   authors, 14 responded with further information, and 8 could not be
   contacted.
   Conclusions: Many details of the experimental and comparison
   interventions in telehealth-delivered dietary chronic disease management
   trials are incompletely reported. This prevents accurate interpretation
   of trial results and implementation of effective interventions in
   clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Background Suboptimal adherence to CPAP limits its clinical
   effectiveness in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Although
   rigorous behavioural interventions improve CPAP adherence, their
   labour-intensive nature has limited widespread implementation. Moreover,
   these interventions have not been tested in patients at risk of poor
   CPAP adherence. Our objective was to determine whether an educational
   video will improve CPAP adherence in patients at risk of poor CPAP
   adherence.
   Methods Patients referred by clinicians without sleep medicine expertise
   to an urban sleep laboratory that serves predominantly minority
   population were randomised to view an educational video about OSA and
   CPAP therapy before the polysomnogram, or to usual care. The primary
   outcome was CPAP adherence during the first 30 days of therapy.
   Secondary outcomes were show rates to sleep clinic (attended
   appointment) and 30-day CPAP adherence after the sleep clinic visit
   date.
   Results A total of 212 patients met the eligibility criteria and were
   randomised to video education (n=99) or to usual care (n=113). There
   were no differences in CPAP adherence at 30 days (3.3, 95\% CI 2.8 to
   3.8 hours/day video education; vs 3.5, 95\% CI 3.1 to 4.0 hours/day
   usual care; p=0.44) or during the 30 days after sleep clinic visit.
   Sleep clinic show rate was 54\% in the video education group and 59\% in
   the usual care group (p=0.41). CPAP adherence, however, significantly
   worsened in patients who did not show up to the sleep clinic.
   Conclusions In patients at risk for poor CPAP adherence, an educational
   video did not improve CPAP adherence or show rates to sleep clinic
   compared with usual care.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Centralisation of services such as cardiology, cardiac surgery, and
   intensive care in many parts of the world has resulted in the need to
   safely transport children with critical cardiac disease from local
   hospitals to specialist centres for diagnostic, surgical, and/or
   critical care intervention. The transport of this cohort of children,
   whether locally or internationally, can present specific clinical and
   logistical challenges. An international group of clinicians with
   expertise in cardiac care and critical care transport worked together to
   summarise current clinical practice relating to key areas of transport.
   This expert review covers the transport of the child with critical
   cardiac disease in terms of referral triage and advice, enabling optimal
   management of locally available resources, clinical stabilisation before
   transport, international air transport, transport considerations in low-
   and middle-income countries, and the transport of children with specific
   cardiac conditions. As specialist services are centralised to fewer
   large centres, the need for safe and timely inter-hospital transport of
   children with critical cardiac disease is only expected to rise in the
   future. The key principles outlined in this review will be helpful for
   practitioners in global settings who are, or might be, involved in
   transporting children between hospitals.}},

Abstract = {{AimTelehealth is a useful method of providing specialist consultation to
   a geographically diverse population. Canadian studies of telehealth for
   paediatric surgery demonstrate good accuracy, but have low numbers of
   cryptorchid patients in their cohorts. Our aim was to confirm Canadian
   studies for our cohort and to assess accuracy regarding cryptorchidism.
   MethodsWe conducted a cohort study of patients seen via paediatric
   surgical telehealth over a 12-month period, to determine accuracy of
   telediagnosis with respect to face-to-face diagnosis and plan.
   ResultsA total of 183 children had 224 videoconferences, resulting in 74
   surgical bookings. There was high diagnostic concordance, except for
   undescended testes. One discharged patient, and two patients booked for
   review, have subsequently required an orchidopexy (false negatives). Of
   15 patients booked for surgery, three did not require an operation
   (false positives). Other patients had their procedures upgraded (from
   open to laparoscopic) or downgraded (from laparoscopic to open) due to
   inaccuracies in far-end assessment.
   ConclusionTelehealth for paediatric surgery is accurate for most
   conditions seen, but for cryptorchidism there are significant concerns.}},

Title = {{Service provider perceptions of telerehabilitation as an additional
   service delivery option within an Australian neurosurgical and
   orthopaedic physiotherapy screening clinic: A qualitative study}},
Journal = {{MUSCULOSKELETAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{7-16}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Neurosurgical \& Orthopaedic Physiotherapy Screening
   Clinic and Multidisciplinary Service (N/OPSC\&MDS) originated as a
   complementary, non-surgical pathway for patients referred to public
   neurosurgical and orthopaedic specialist services. Patient access to the
   N/OPSC\&MDS could potentially be improved with the implementation of
   telerehabilitation as an additional method of service delivery.
   Objective: To evaluate service provider's views on (1) current barriers
   to patients' accessing N/OPSC \& MD services, and (2) the implementation
   of telerehabilitation within the N/OPSC\&MDS.
   Design: Qualitative descriptive study design.
   Methods: Healthcare providers (n = 26) were recruited from six
   N/OPSC\&MD services located throughout Queensland, Australia.
   Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore service providers'
   views with respect to existing barriers to patients accessing the
   N/OPSC\&MDS, and if telerehabilitation could be feasibly adopted to
   address current barriers.
   Results: Template analysis resulted in six themes: (1) barriers to some
   patients' accessing current N/OPSC\&MD services are complex \&
   multifaceted; (2) telerehabilitation could improve patient access to
   appropriate management for their musculoskeletal condition; (3)
   telerehabilitation may have limitations when compared to face-to-face
   healthcare; (4) the delivery of telerehabilitation needs to be flexible;
   (5) perceived barriers, and (6) facilitators to the successful
   implementation of telerehabilitation within the N/OPSC\&MDS.
   Conclusion: This study represents a critical step in determining the
   readiness of service providers for the implementation of
   telerehabilitation within the N/OPSC\&MDS. Although cautious, service
   providers are overall accepting of the implementation of
   telerehabilitation, acknowledging that it could eliminate several
   current barriers, subsequently achieving more equitable access to the
   service. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{23}},

Pages = {{983-995}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background:Blended care, meaning that online (Internet) components are
   used in combination with face-to-face contact, in mental health is
   increasingly encouraged, but research about the needs of psychologists
   is scarce.Methods:We assessed the perceptions, design, and barriers
   toward blended care among members of the Dutch Association of
   Psychologists through an e-mailed survey. Mean scores (SD) and answer
   percentages were calculated. Mann-Whitney tests were performed to
   investigate differences between users and nonusers and primary- and
   secondary care professionals.Results:Generally, psychologists (63\%
   response rate) had a positive perception toward blended care and they
   intended to use it in future (M=3.71, SD=1.19). Users of blended care
   and secondary care professionals were more positive toward blended care
   than nonusers and primary care professionals. Online psychoeducation,
   diary forms, and exercises for different therapeutic approaches and
   communication technology configurations were most welcomed. Still, quite
   some barriers were mentioned before professionals would use blended
   care.Conclusions:Psychologists had a positive perception toward blended
   care, as long as attention is paid to the perceived barriers. Results of
   this survey could be used in the development of online components that
   correspond to the needs of professionals.Reviewing the needs of

Abstract = {{Background:Embedding Web-based interventions within physiotherapy has
   potential, but knowledge on patient adherence to these interventions is
   limited.Introduction:This study explores which patient-, intervention-,
   and environment-related factors are determinants of adherence to the
   online component of e-Exercise, a 12-week blended intervention for
   patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis.Methods:A convergent mixed
   methods study was performed, embedded within an ongoing trial.
   Quantitative data of 109 participants that received e-Exercise were used
   for negative binomial regression analysis. Adherence was defined as the
   number of online evaluated weeks. Next, semistructured interviews on
   factors related to adherence to the online component were
   analyzed.Results:Nineteen participants with missing outcome data because
   their program was not started were excluded. Of the 90 analyzed
   participants, 81.1\% were evaluated for at least 8 weeks. Adherence was
   highest for participants with middle education, 1-5-year osteoarthritis
   duration, and participants who were physiotherapist recruited. The 10
   analyzed interviews revealed that sufficient Internet skills,
   self-discipline, execution of the exercise plan, the intervention's
   usability, flexibility, persuasive design, added value, and acceptable
   required time, and research participation were linked to favorable
   adherence.Discussion:It is unknown if patients who adhered to the online
   component also adhered to their exercise plans. The relationship between
   adherence to the online component and clinical outcomes will be
   addressed in a future study.Conclusions:The majority of the participants
   adhered to the online component of e-Exercise, illustrating its
   applicability. The integration within the physiotherapy setting and
   intervention's persuasive design appear to have an important role in
   optimizing patient adherence.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction:Timely access to orthopedic rehabilitation is an important
   problem for the Ukrainian healthcare system. The international
   orthopedic community aims to achieve the best possible outcome for
   patient care by modifying rehabilitation methods and using telemedicine
   technology. The theme of this article is to discuss the integration of
   telemedicine technology in the rehabilitation of patients with injuries
   of the lower extremities.Materials and Methods:Consecutive patients were
   recruited over a 2-year period. A total of 74 subjects with lower
   extremity injuries were enrolled in the study and monitored during a
   3-month period. Twenty-six patients from the control group underwent
   traditional rehabilitation procedures for a 3-month period after injury.
   A total of 48 subjects were enrolled in the telerehabilitation group for
   a 3-month study period and were trained with a set of exercises for home
   use. Home remote monitoring for the 48 test subjects included use of a
   smartphone with gyroscope, G-sensor, magnetometer, and barometer, which
   was fixed to the injured limb. Software for the smartphone was developed
   at the I. Horbachevsky Ternopil Medical University, Ukraine. Software
   permits the monitoring of exercise time, the frequency of active
   movements of the injured limb, the number of steps per hour, and the
   walking speed.Results:The 3-month rehabilitation period started with the
   power load of 10\% of body weight, following 3-5 steps five times per
   day with a speed no >1km/h. The orthopedic surgeon, during
   telerehabilitation, took significantly less time to consult patients
   (2.3min0.4) than the traditional rehabilitation (12.6min +/- 2.9).
   Patient satisfaction was higher for the telerehabilitation (83.1\%+/-
   14.2) than for the orthopedic surgeon's traditional rehabilitation
   (33.1\%+/- 8.9).Conclusions:Telerehabilitation is a good alternative for
   providing access to specialty care for the growing number of patients
   with traumatic injuries.}},

Abstract = {{Background:Space radiation can cause different types of cancers in
   crewmembers, especially during long-term space missions.Introduction:To
   date, a complete bilateral breast ultrasound has not been performed at
   the International Space Station (ISS). A breast screening imaging
   technique could be a useful tool for early identification of breast
   cancer in astronauts. We hypothesized that breast ultrasound performed
   by a crewmember while being remotely guided by a specialist from the
   ground could be an essential tool for medical diagnosis in space. This
   project aimed to test an ultrasound screening protocol for breast tissue
   using real-time remotely guided telemedicine techniques.Materials and
   Methods:One female volunteer, with no previous medical experience,
   performed a self-scanned bilateral breast ultrasound exam guided by a
   remote sonographer. Dynamic ultrasound images were collected using a
   25mm broadband linear array transducer. To simulate fluid shift on the
   volunteer during microgravity, the bed was tilted -6
   degrees.Results:Recorded ultrasound images were analyzed by
   radiologists, comparing the findings with a gold standard. The
   experiment demonstrated that real-time remotely guided sonography exam
   is feasible and can yield meaningful clinical results.Discussion:This
   case study showed that remotely guided breast ultrasound can be
   performed and might become an important tool for diagnosis of breast
   cancer in space missions.Conclusion:The results cannot be generalized
   based on one subject, and additional research is warranted in this area
   in addition to its validation on the ISS. This technique, however, has
   potential for use as part of preventive medicine procedures for
   long-term space missions at the ISS, and eventually for human
   settlements on the Moon and Mars.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: To validate the findings of a single-center pilot study
   showing elevated urinary N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide
   (NTproBNP) concentrations in preterm infants subsequently developing
   severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in a multicenter setting across
   eight European and Middle East countries.
   METHODS: Prospective observational study in 967 preterm infants <30
   weeks' gestational age assessing the capacity of urinary NTproBNP on
   days of life (DOLs) 14 and 28 to predict ROP requiring treatment.
   RESULTS: Urinary NTproBNP concentrations were markedly elevated in
   infants who developed ROP requiring treatment (n = 94) compared with
   survivors without ROP treatment (n = 837), at both time points (median
   (interquartile range) DOL14: 8,950 (1,925-23,783) vs. 3,083
   (1,193-17,393) vs. 816 (290-3,078) pg/ml, P<0.001) and DOL28 (2,203
   (611-4,063) vs. 1,671 (254-11,340) vs. 408 (162-1,126) pg/ml, P<0.001).
   C-statistic of NTproBNP for treated ROP or death was 0.731 (95\%
   confidence interval 0.654-0.774) for DOL14 and 0.683 (0.622-0.745) for
   DOL28 (P<0.001). Threshold scores were calculated, potentially enabling
   around 20\% of infants with low NTproBNP scores never to be screened
   with ophthalmoscopy.
   CONCLUSION: There is a strong association between early urinary NTproBNP
   and subsequent ROP development, which can be used to further refine
   subgroups of patients with high or low risk of severe ROP.}},

Abstract = {{Ongoing payment reform in dialysis necessitates better patient outcomes
   and lower costs. Suggested improvements to processes of care for
   maintenance dialysis patients are abundant; however, their impact on
   patient-important outcomes is unclear. This systematic review included
   comparative randomized controlled trials or observational studies with
   no restriction on language, published from 2000 to 2014, involving at
   least 5 adult dialysis patients who received a minimum of 6 months of
   follow-up. The effect size was pooled and stratified by intervention
   strategy (multidisciplinary care {[}MDC], home dialysis, alternate
   dialysis settings, and electronic health record implementation).
   Heterogeneity (I-2) was used to assess the variability in study effects
   related to study differences rather than chance. Of the 1988 articles
   screened, 25 international studies with 74,833 maintenance dialysis
   patients were included. Interventions with MDC or home dialysis were
   associated with a lower mortality (hazard ratio {[}HR]=0.72, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 0.61, 0.84, I-2=41.6\%; HR=0.57, 95\% CI
   0.41, 0.81, I-2=89.0\%; respectively) and hospitalizations (incidence
   rate ratio {[}IRR]=0.68, 95\% CI 0.51, 0.91, I-2=NA; IRR=0.88, 95\% CI
   0.64, 1.20, I-2=79.6\%; respectively). Alternate dialysis settings also
   were associated with a reduction in hospitalizations (IRR=0.41, 95\% CI
   0.25, 0.69, I-2=0.0\%). This systematic review underscores the
   importance of multidisciplinary care, and also the value of telemedicine
   as a means to increase access to providers and enhance outcomes for
   those dialyzing at home or in alternate settings, including those with
   limited access to nephrology expertise because of travel distance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study characterizes telehealth claims for mental health
   and substance abuse (MH/SA) services by using national private claims
   data.
   Methods: Telehealth-related mental health service claims were identified
   with private claims data from 2009 to 2013. These data-provided by the
   Health Care Cost Institute-included claims from Aetna, Humana, and
   UnitedHealth for more than 50 million individuals per year.
   Results: In 2009-2013, there were 13,480 MH/SA telehealth provider
   claims out of 3,986,159 claims, with the majority of telehealth claims
   submitted by psychiatrists. For telehealth services, there was a
   decreasing trend for average reimbursements (\$54.61 in 2009 to \$43.28
   in 2013). Average reimbursements for telehealth claims were half those
   for nontelehealth claims. Reimbursements for nine of the top 10
   telehealth services were lower in 2015 dollars than for the same
   services provided during face-to-face treatment.
   Conclusions: Widespread adoption and use of costly telehealth
   technologies for mental health services may be limited by low
   reimbursements for telehealth services.}},

Abstract = {{To improve subspecialty access, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System (VAAAHS)
   implemented the first Specialty Care Access Network (SCAN)-Extension of
   Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) in chronic liver disease. SCAN-ECHO
   Liver links primary care providers (PCPs) to hepatologists via secure
   video-teleconferencing. We aim to describe characteristics of
   participants (PCPs) and patients (clinical question and diagnosis) in
   SCAN-ECHO Liver.
   This is a prospective study of the VAAAHS SCAN-ECHO Liver (June 10,
   2011-March 31, 2015). This evaluation was carried out as a non-research
   activity under the guidance furnished by VHA Handbook 1058.05. It was
   approved through the Medicine Service at VAAAHS as noted in the
   attestation document which serves as documentation of approved
   non-research, quality improvement activities in VHA.
   In total, 106 PCPs from 23 sites participated. A total of 155 SCAN-ECHO
   sessions discussed 519 new and 49 return patients. 29.4\% of Liver
   Clinic requests were completed in SCAN-ECHO Liver. SCAN-ECHO Liver
   consults were completed an average of 10 days sooner than in
   conventional clinic. Potential travel saving was 250 miles round-trip
   (median 255 (IQR 142-316) per patient.
   SCAN-ECHO Liver provided specialty care with increased efficiency and
   convenience for chronic liver disease patients. One of three of Liver
   Clinic consults was diverted to SCAN-ECHO Liver, reducing consult
   completion time by 20\%.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To prospectively evaluate the long-term outcomes after a
   telementoring program for distant teaching of endovascular aneurysm
   repair (EVAR) and the degree of EVAR procedure assimilation into routine
   practice. Methods: A telementoring protocol using stepwise introduction
   of EVAR was implemented between a university care center and a remote
   vascular health care site; from March 1999 to October 2003, 49 EVAR
   patients (mean age 72 years; 48 men) were treated during telementoring
   at the remote center. After the telementoring period, 86 patients (mean
   age 71 years; 77 men) underwent EVAR procedures carried out at the
   secondary care center from November 2003 to July 2011. The long-term
   outcomes were compared between the EVAR procedures performed during
   telementoring with the procedures performed independently thereafter.
   Results: No significant difference was appreciated between telementored
   and not telementored procedures either in 30-day mortality (4.1\% vs
   2.3\%, p=0.621) or in the initial technical success (93.9\% vs 97.7\%,
   p=0.353). The telementored group showed no significant difference in
   overall aneurysm-related mortality (6.1\% vs 2.3\%, p=0.353) or in the
   overall complication rates (p=0.985). The reintervention rate was
   significantly lower among the unmentored procedures (11.6\% vs 32.7\%,
   p=0.004). In particular, significantly fewer patients underwent late
   endovascular procedures (1.2\% vs 12.2\%, p=0.009) and late percutaneous
   interventions (7.0\% vs 20.4\%, p=0.027) after telementoring ceased.
   Conclusion: The telementoring program followed here allowed excellent
   EVAR skill assimilation into the routine practice of a remote health
   care site. Telementoring is a feasible strategy to support skill
   introduction in remote medical facilities.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in telemedicine among physicians and
   patients; however, the evidence regarding the quality of care delivered
   by telemedicine, and telenephrology in particular, compared with
   in-person care is limited. In this review, different electronic
   modalities used to deliver nephrology care are reviewed and critiqued,
   with a focused analysis from the Australian and United States
   perspectives. Both countries are geographically expansive with
   significant rural populations where access to nephrology care is
   limited. However, their health care systems are organized differently.
   The Australian health care system is a mostly nonprofit, single-payer
   system, whereas the United States system is more fractured with a
   greater proportion of patients covered by for-profit private insurance
   or no insurance coverage. Videoconferencing is widely used in Australia
   to manage kidney disease including chronic kidney disease, dialysis,
   pediatric nephrology, and post-kidney transplantation care. In contrast,
   the United States telenephrology experience is limited, with most
   reports originating from the Veterans Health Administration, a
   single-payer system providing care for nearly 9 million veterans,
   similar to 3 million of whom reside in rural communities. Preliminary
   reports from the Veterans Health Administration suggest that that
   delivery of nephrology care via videoconferencing results in clinical
   outcomes that are at least equivalent to in-person care and improved
   patient adherence to scheduled appointments. Nevertheless, large,
   adequately controlled studies are needed to identify patient populations
   that are most likely to benefit from telenephrology and to determine the
   optimal systems for the delivery of telenephrology care.}},

Abstract = {{Telemedicine services facilitate the evaluation, diagnosis, and
   management of the remote patient. Telemedicine has rapidly flourished in
   the United States and has improved access to care, outcomes, and patient
   satisfaction. However, the use of telemedicine in ophthalmology is
   currently in its infancy and has yet to gain wide acceptance. Current
   models of telemedicine in ophthalmology are largely performed via
   ``store and forward{''} methods, but remote monitoring and interactive
   modalities exist. Although studies have examined the effects of
   telemedicine, few reports have characterized its current status. We
   perform a descriptive analysis of the current state of teleophthalmology
   in the United States. We describe the use of teleophthalmology in the
   hospital and outpatient settings. We also review the applications to
   retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular
   degeneration, and glaucoma, as well as anticipated barriers and hurdles
   for the future adoption of teleophthalmology. With ongoing advances in
   teleophthalmology, these models may provide earlier detection and more
   reliable monitoring of vision-threatening diseases. (C) 2017 by the

Title = {{Examining the Value of Video Visits to Patients in an Outpatient Urology
   Clinic}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To examine the value that urologic patients place on video
   visits before the implementation of a telemedicine program at our
   institution's outpatient urology clinic.
   METHODS We conducted an on-site survey at a tertiary medical center's
   outpatient urology clinic over a 3-month period. Our survey questions
   assessed patient access to technology needed for video visits, patients'
   perceptions about video visits, the amount patients would be willing to
   pay out-ofpocket for video visits, and total time patients expect to
   spend during a standard clinic visit.
   RESULTS We completed 108 surveys of adult patients. Of the patients,
   94\% owned a device that could be used for a video visit. The median
   level of patient interest in video visits was reported as 72 out of 100
   (interquartile range: 51.25; scale: 0-100,) with a statistically
   significant difference in interest level across different age groups (P
   = .022). The median amount patients reported they were willing to pay
   out-of-pocket for video visits was \$20 (interquartile range: \$39.25,
   max: \$174).
   CONCLUSION The vast majority of patients in our outpatient urology
   clinic possess the technology necessary to engage in video visits.
   Patients are highly interested in video visits and report a willingness
   to share in the costs of these visits. Given that a portion of patients
   travel long distances for specialty clinic visits, video visits have the
   potential to substantially improve the patient experience. Published by

Abstract = {{Telemedicine has gained popularity in recent years. Medical images can
   be transferred over the Internet to enable the telediagnosis between
   medical staffs and to make the patient's history accessible to medical
   staff from anywhere. Therefore, integrity protection of the medical
   image is a serious concern due to the broadcast nature of the Internet.
   Some watermarking techniques are proposed to control the integrity of
   medical images. However, they require embedding of extra information
   (watermark) into image before transmission. It decreases visual quality
   of the medical image and can cause false diagnosis. The proposed method
   uses passive image authentication mechanism to detect the tampered
   regions on medical images. Structural texture information is obtained
   from the medical image by using local binary pattern rotation invariant
   (LBPROT) to make the keypoint extraction techniques more successful.
   Keypoints on the texture image are obtained with scale invariant feature
   transform (SIFT). Tampered regions are detected by the method by
   matching the keypoints. The method improves the keypoint-based passive
   image authentication mechanism (they do not detect tampering when the
   smooth region is used for covering an object) by using LBPROT before
   keypoint extraction because smooth regions also have texture
   information. Experimental results show that the method detects tampered
   regions on the medical images even if the forged image has undergone
   some attacks (Gaussian blurring/additive white Gaussian noise) or the
   forged regions are scaled/rotated before pasting.}},

Abstract = {{Patients receiving home parenteral nutrition (HPN), a life-sustaining
   intravenous (IV) infusion that provides nourishment and hydration to
   patients with short gut or inflammatory bowel diseases, are often
   isolated and not in visual contact with peers or health providers. One
   completed clinical trial (Clinical Trials.gov NCT0190028) and 1 ongoing
   clinical trial (Clinical Trials.gov NCT02987569) are evaluating a mobile
   videoconferencing-delivered support group intervention for patients on
   HPN and their caregivers. This home-based telemedicine intervention uses
   encrypted tablet-based videoconferencing to connect multiple families in
   real time. The twice-daily IV regimen is challenging for patients who
   may experience infusion catheter-related bloodstream infections,
   difficulties with fatigue, loss of sleep, depressive disorders, and
   worry over the potential life-threatening side effects and the expenses
   of this therapy. Using secure telemedicine, the facilitated support
   group intervention aims to enhance HPN home care, daily functioning, and
   quality of life. The authors provide the rationale for the telemedicine
   approach with HPN users and caregivers. They provide how-to information
   about the content and process of the facilitated support group sessions
   via secure videoconferencing. They share lessons learned from the
   ongoing evaluation of the telemedicine approach.}},

Abstract = {{Background: and purpose: Acute stroke care is to detect, diagnose, and
   treat patients in the shortest amount of time. Access to acute stroke
   care may however be limited in some areas and telemedicine has been thus
   used to increase its access. Coding acute stroke care as a health
   intervention had limited attention in the past.
   Methods: The International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI)
   currently under development was used to identify existing codes relevant
   for coding acute stroke care interventions, including telestroke. A
   review of the ICHI was conducted to identify codes relevant for acute
   stroke care by two independent reviewers.
   Results: A matching ICHI code was found for each of the steps in the
   acute stroke care process but no ICHI codes were available to
   specifically capture telestroke.
   Conclusion: As telemedicine intervention is likely to become more common
   in the future, it will be imperative that the ICHI is able to code such
   interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision loss and blindness
   in the U.S. Risk factors include African American race, older age,
   family history of glaucoma, and diabetes. This paper describes the
   evaluation of a mobile eye health and a telemedicine program designed to
   improve access to eye care among people at high-risk for glaucoma.
   Methods: The RE-AIM (reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and
   maintenance) evaluation framework was used to harmonize indicators. Both
   programs provided community-based eye health education and eye services
   related to glaucoma detection and care. Each program reported data on
   participants and community partners. An external evaluator conducted
   site visit interviews with program staff and community partners.
   Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated and analyzed using the
   RE-AIM dimensions.
   Discussion: By targeting high-risk populations and providing
   comprehensive eye exams, both programs detected a large proportion of
   new glaucoma-related cases (17-19\%) a much larger proportion than that
   found in the general population ( < 2\%). The educational intervention
   increased glaucoma knowledge; evidence that it led people to seek eye
   care was inconclusive.
   Conclusions: Evaluation findings from the mobile eye health program and
   the telemedicine program may provide useful information for wider
   implementation in public health clinics and in optometrist clinics
   located in retail outlets.}},

Abstract = {{Background The PRE-hospital Stroke Treatment Organization was formed in
   2016 as an international consortium of medical practitioners involved in
   pre-hospital treatment of patients with acute stroke.
   Aims PRE-hospital Stroke Treatment Organization's mission is to improve
   stroke outcomes by supporting research and advocacy for pre-hospital
   stroke treatment in Mobile Stroke Units. PRE-hospital Stroke Treatment
   Organization will provide a platform to enhance collaborative research
   across the spectrum of acute stroke management in the pre-hospital
   setting. PRE-hospital Stroke Treatment Organization will also facilitate
   the appropriate proliferation and distribution of Mobile Stroke Units by
   providing a forum for professional communication, resource for public
   education, and stimulus for government, industry, and philanthropic
   support.
   Summary of review In this white paper, we describe the evidence
   supporting pre-hospital stroke treatment, progress to date, practical
   issues such as application in various environments and staffing, planned
   research initiatives, and organizational structure.
   Conclusions PRE-hospital Stroke Treatment Organization is
   not-for-profit, with membership open to anyone involved (or hoping to
   become involved) in pre-hospital stroke care. PRE-hospital Stroke
   Treatment Organization has a Steering Committee comprised of members
   from Europe, U.S., Canada, Australia, and other regions having a Mobile
   Stroke Unit in operation. PRE-hospital Stroke Treatment Organization
   convenes satellite meetings for membership at the International Stroke
   Conference and European Stroke Congress each year to address the
   PRE-hospital Stroke Treatment Organization mission. The first research
   collaborations agreed upon are to: (1) develop a list of common data
   elements to be collected by all Mobile Stroke Unit programs and entered
   into a common research database, and (2) develop a protocol for
   investigating the natural history of hyper-acute Intracerebral
   Hemorrhage.}},

Abstract = {{Background Rapid dissemination and coordination of clinical and imaging
   data among multidisciplinary team members are essential for optimal
   acute stroke care.
   Aim To characterize the feasibility and utility of the Synapse Emergency
   Room mobile (Synapse ERm) informatics system.
   Methods We implemented the Synapse ERm system for integration of
   clinical data, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance, and catheter
   angiographic imaging, and real-time stroke team communications, in
   consecutive acute neurovascular patients at a Comprehensive Stroke
   Center.
   Results From May 2014 to October 2014, the Synapse ERm application was
   used by 33 stroke team members in 84 Code Stroke alerts. Patient age was
   69.6 (17.1), with 41.5\% female. Final diagnosis was: ischemic stroke
   64.6\%, transient ischemic attack 7.3\%, intracerebral hemorrhage 6.1\%,
   and cerebrovascular-mimic 22.0\%. Each patient Synapse ERm record was
   viewed by a median of 10 (interquartile range 6-18) times by a median of
   3 (interquartile range 2-4) team members. The most used feature was
   computerized tomography, magnetic resonance, and catheter angiography
   image display. In-app tweet team, communications were sent by median 1
   (interquartile range 0-1, range 0-13) users per case and viewed by
   median 1 (interquartile range 0-3, range 0-44) team members. Use of the
   system was associated with rapid treatment times, faster than national
   guidelines, including median door-to-needle 51.0min (interquartile range
   40.5-69.5) and median door-to-groin 94.5min (interquartile range
   85.5-121.3). In user surveys, the mobile information platform was judged
   easy to employ in 91\% (95\% confidence interval 65\%-99\%) of uses and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a patient's confidential data hiding scheme in
   electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and its subsequent wireless transmission.
   Patient's confidential data is embedded in ECG (called stego-ECG) using
   chaotic map and the sample value difference approach. The sample value
   difference approach effectually hides the patient's confidential data in
   ECG sample pairs at the predefined locations. The chaotic map generates
   these predefined locations through the use of selective control
   parameters. Subsequently, the wireless transmission of the stego-ECG is
   analyzed using the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
   system in a Rayleigh fading scenario for telemedicine applications.
   Evaluation of proposed method on all 48 records of MIT-BIH arrhythmia
   ECG database demonstrates that the embedding does not alter the
   diagnostic features of cover ECG. The secret data imperceptibility in
   stego-ECG is evident through the statistical and clinical performance
   measures. Statistical measures comprise of Percentage Root-mean-square
   Difference (PRD), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Kulback-Leibler
   Divergence (KL-Div), etc. while clinical metrics includes wavelet Energy
   Based Diagnostic Distortion (WEDD) and Wavelet based Weighted PRD
   (WWPRD). The various channel Signal-to-Noise Ratio scenarios are
   simulated for wireless communication of stego-ECG in OFDM system. The
   proposed method over all the 48 records of MIT-BIH arrhythmia database
   resulted in average, PRD = 0.26, PSNR = 55.49, KL-Div = 3.34 x 10(-6),
   WEDD = 0.02, and WWPRD = 0.10 with secret data size of 21Kb. Further, a
   comparative analysis of proposed method and recent existing works was
   also performed. The results clearly, demonstrated the superiority of
   proposed method.}},

Title = {{The use of telemedicine for delivering healthcare in Japan: Systematic
   review of literature published in Japanese and English languages}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Background: In common with other countries, Japan has an ageing
   population and geographical impediments to healthcare access. The role
   of telemedicine within the Japanese health system may be of wide
   interest, yet it has not been comprehensively explored and documented.
   Thus, the aim of this study was to systematically review the Japanese
   and English language literature relating to the clinical use of
   telemedicine in Japan.
   Methods: For studies published in Japanese, we searched Ichushi and
   CiNii. For English language publications, we searched Cochrane Library,
   PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. All peer-reviewed articles
   describing the clinical use of telemedicine and published between 2007
   and 2016 were included. Data on clinical area, study type, technology
   used, and type of communication were extracted. Studies were categorised
   by prevention, screening, diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment.
   Results: The search yielded 1476 records; 26 Japanese language and 15
   English language articles were selected for review. A wide range of
   clinical areas were represented; however, home care and life-style
   related studies were dominant. More than 50\% of studies were related to
   prevention and early diagnosis. The majority of Japanese studies
   involved doctor-to-doctor consultation. Smartphones and remote
   monitoring systems were the main types of technology used.
   Conclusions: Most studies of telemedicine in Japan are published in the
   Japanese language and are thus relatively inaccessible to the rest of
   the world; for the first time, this study has provided an overview of
   the clinical use of telemedicine in Japan. The clinically related papers
   reflect the Japanese cultural focus on disease prevention.}},

Abstract = {{Health services in the United States and Europe have reported that
   tele-orthopaedics saves significant patient travel time, reduces time
   off work, increases satisfaction with care and in some scenarios reduces
   the cost of care. Less is known about the role of tele-orthopaedics in
   Australia. The aim of this study was to explore Australian-based
   tele-orthopaedic services, and to identify the barriers and enablers
   associated with these services. We used a qualitative case study
   methodology where specific services were identified from multiple
   sources and invited to participate in a structured interview. Nine
   tele-orthopaedic services contributed to the study. Telehealth activity
   in each service ranged from one to 75 patients per week, and service
   maturity ranged from three months to 10 years. Services were used
   predominantly for fracture clinics and peri-operative consultations. The
   majority (78\%) of services used videoconferencing. Two services used
   asynchronous methods to review radiographs without direct patient
   involvement. Tele-orthopaedics was found to be disruptive as it required
   the redesign of many care processes. However, all services found the
   redesign feasible. Staff resistance was a commonly cited barrier.
   Further, imaging repositories from multiple imaging providers
   complicated access to information. Key enablers included clinical
   champions, picture archiving and communication systems, and the
   perceived benefit to patients who would avoid the need for travel.
   Whilst it appears that tele-orthopaedics is not widely utilised in
   Australia, recognition of the barriers and enablers is important for the
   development of similar services.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to describe patient-related characteristics of those
   attending the diabetes telehealth service delivered from a tertiary
   hospital and compare these with the characteristics of patients
   attending face-to-face visits at the same hospital's diabetes outpatient
   service. This analysis could inform diabetes telehealth service
   improvements. To our knowledge, there has been no prior evaluation of a
   diabetes telehealth service in Australia. A cross-sectional survey was
   conducted as part of the Australian National Diabetes Audit in May 2016
   for all patients attending the diabetes telehealth service and diabetes
   outpatient service. The diabetes telehealth service was serving a
   greater proportion of females, indigenous people and patients with a
   longer mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes
   mellitus patients in the diabetes telehealth service group had a higher
   average glycated haemoglobin of 9.1\% (76mmol/mol) vs 8.1\% (65mmol/mol)
   in the diabetes outpatient service group. The diabetes telehealth
   service had more people with initial visits; had higher self-reported
   smoking rates in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients; and had adequate
   access to allied health supports as recommended for diabetes management.
   Diabetes telehealth service patients had more complex diabetes as
   evidenced by a higher proportion of indigenous clients, higher glycated
   haemoglobin and longer mean duration of diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Scaling of projects from inception to establishment within the
   healthcare system is rarely formally reported. The Victorian Stroke
   Telemedicine (VST) programme provided a very useful opportunity to
   describe how rural hospitals in Victoria were able to access a network
   of Melbourne-based neurologists via telemedicine. The VST programme was
   initially piloted at one site in 2010 and has gradually expanded as a
   state-wide regional service operating with 16 hospitals in 2017. The aim
   of this paper is to summarise the factors that facilitated the
   state-wide transition of the VST programme. A naturalistic case-study
   was used and data were obtained from programme documents, e.g. minutes
   of governance committees, including the steering committee, the
   management committee and six working groups; operational and evaluation
   documentation, interviews and research field-notes taken by project
   staff. Thematic analysis was undertaken, with results presented in
   narrative form to provide a summary of the lived experience of
   developing and scaling the VST programme. The main success factors were
   attaining funding from various sources, identifying a clinical need and
   evidence-based solution, engaging stakeholders and facilitating
   co-design, including embedding the programme within policy, iterative
   evaluation including performing financial sustainability modelling, and
   conducting dissemination activities of the interim results, including
   promotion of early successes.}},

Abstract = {{The clavicle is one of the most commonly fractured bones in the adult
   population. Management has traditionally been conservative, however more
   recent research has yielded higher non-union rates associated with
   non-operative management. This study aims to analyse the proportion of
   operative and non-operative treatment methods for clavicle fracture in a
   tertiary hospital facility and rural health sites accessed via
   telehealth, comparing patient outcome between these two methods of
   fracture management. Following ethical approval, a retrospective review
   was conducted of patients presenting with clavicle fractures to the
   Princess Alexandra Hospital Fracture Clinics and to Orthopaedic Fracture
   Clinics run via teleconference with rural health sites. Only 2\% of
   patients received operative fracture management in the telehealth group,
   versus 33\% in the tertiary hospital sample. Patient outcome was
   measured in the larger tertiary hospital sample, with clinical notes
   reflecting good patient outcome in 70\% of operatively managed patients
   and 85\% of patients with conservatively managed clavicle fractures. For
   the patients in the telehealth sample that returned for follow-up
   appointments, 93\% reported a good outcome with one of these individuals
   undergoing operative treatment and the rest managed conservatively.}},

   low-glycemic load (Low GL) or Low Fat prescription, among
   overweight/obese school-age children.
   MethodsFive-week telephone dietary counselling intervention for parents
   of overweight/obese school-age children recruited through the Slone

   counselling sessions, and study completion rate was 91\% (based on
   completion of the final dietary recalls). Reported satisfaction was
   high. In adjusted analyses limited to recall completers,' reduction in
   dietary GL (g/1000kcal) achieved within the Low GL group was significant
   (p=0.01) and greater than the change in dietary GL in the Low Fat group
   (mean +/- SE; -12.9 +/- 4.4 vs. 5.1 +/- 4.9, p=0.03). Similarly,
   reduction in dietary fat (\% of total energy) within the Low Fat group
   was significant (-5.6 +/- 2.5, p=0.046) but with no difference between
   groups (p=0.25).
   ConclusionA telephone-based dietary intervention for overweight/obese
   children, implemented through a national paediatric research network,
   fostered prescribed dietary changes. ClinicalTrials.gov registration:

Abstract = {{This paper examines the patterns of visits to primary care and eye care
   providers for annually recommended diabetes preventive care services
   over a two-year period in a sample of U. S. adults aged 18 years and
   older with diabetes drawn from the 2008-2013 Medical Expenditure Panel
   Survey-Household Component (n = 3982). The four-category outcome
   variable was defined based on the four possible combinations of whether
   an individual missed an annual visit to a primary care provider for
   preventive care services in at least one year over the twoyear period
   and whether the individual missed an annual visit to an eye care
   provider in at least one year over this period. Descriptive statistics
   and a multinomial logistic regression model were estimated. 51.9\% of
   the sample missed an annual visit to a primary care or eye care provider
   for preventive care services over a two-year period. Although 48.8\% of
   the sample missed at least one annual visit to an eye care provider,
   85.6\% of these individuals did visit a primary care provider for
   preventive care services during the year they did not visit an eye care
   provider. This suggests that primary care-based screening for diabetic
   retinopathy could reach most individuals who do not receive regular eye
   care. Regression results particularly relevant for potential
   interventions were that missing annual visits was significantly more
   likely for individuals without health insurance or a usual source of
   healthcare and for those who were not receiving diabetes treatments and
   did not have or were not aware of having diabetes-related complications.}},

Title = {{Patient preferences for direct-to-consumer telemedicine services: a
   nationwide survey}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Direct-to-consumer (DTC) telemedicine providers has the
   potential to change the traditional patient-physician relationship.
   Professional medical organizations recommend that telemedicine exist
   within the medical home. This study aims to understand patients'
   preferences and desires for DTC telemedicine.
   Methods: We conducted a nationwide survey of 4345 survey respondents
   demographically balanced to represent the United States adult
   population. The survey consisted of questions assessing the respondents'
   attributes and their willingness and comfortability using telemedicine
   as well as the importance and desired attributes of a provider providing
   care via telemedicine.
   Results: Relatively few respondents (3.5\%) had ever had an online video
   visit with their care provider. Respondents were more willing to see
   their own provider via telemedicine than unwilling (52\% vs. 25\%).
   Additionally, respondents were less willing to use telemedicine to see a
   different provider from the same healthcare organization (35\%) and were
   least willing to see a different provider from a different organization
   (19\%). Forty-one percent of respondents felt it was unimportant that
   their current provider offer telemedicine, and only 15\% would consider
   leaving their current provider to a new provider who offers telemedicine
   as an option. More than half (56\%) of respondents felt it was important
   to have an established relationship with a provider they're having a
   telemedicine visit with. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (60\%) felt it
   was important for a telemedicine provider to have access to their health
   records.
   Conclusions: Patients prefer to use telemedicine with their own doctor
   with whom they have an established relationship.}},

Title = {{Mobile microscopy as a screening tool for oral cancer in India: A pilot
   study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Oral cancer is the most common type of cancer among men in India and
   other countries in South Asia. Late diagnosis contributes significantly
   to this mortality, highlighting the need for effective and specific
   point-of-care diagnostic tools. The same regions with high prevalence of
   oral cancer have seen extensive growth in mobile phone infrastructure,
   which enables widespread access to telemedicine services. In this work,
   we describe the evaluation of an automated tablet-based mobile
   microscope as an adjunct for telemedicine-based oral cancer screening in
   India. Brush biopsy, a minimally invasive sampling technique was
   combined with a simplified staining protocol and a tablet-based mobile
   microscope to facilitate local collection of digital images and remote
   evaluation of the images by clinicians. The tablet-based mobile
   microscope (CellScope device) combines an iPad Mini with collection
   optics, LED illumination and Bluetooth-controlled motors to scan a slide
   specimen and capture high-resolution images of stained brush biopsy
   samples. Researchers at the Mazumdar Shaw Medical Foundation (MSMF) in
   Bangalore, India used the instrument to collect and send randomly
   selected images of each slide for telepathology review. Evaluation of
   the concordance between gold standard histology, conventional microscopy
   cytology, and remote pathologist review of the images was performed as
   part of a pilot study of mobile microscopy as a screening tool for oral
   cancer. Results indicated that the instrument successfully collected
   images of sufficient quality to enable remote diagnoses that show
   concordance with existing techniques. Further studies will evaluate the
   effectiveness of oral cancer screening with mobile microscopy by
   minimally trained technicians in low-resource settings.}},

Title = {{Economic Evaluation of Teledentistry in Cleft Lip and Palate Patients}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Objective:To assess the use of Teledentistry (TD) in delivering
   specialist dental services at the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) for
   rural and regional patients and to conduct an economic evaluation by
   building a decision model to estimate the costs and effectiveness of
   Teledental consultations compared with standard consultations at the
   RCH.Methods:A model-based analysis was conducted to determine the
   potential costs of implementing TD at the RCH. The outcome measure was
   timely consultations (whether the patient presented within an
   appropriate time according to the recommended schedule). Dental records
   at the RCH of those who presented for orthodontic or pediatric dental
   consultations were assessed. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA),
   comparing TD with the traditional method of consultation, was conducted.
   One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of the
   results.Results and Materials:A total of 367 TD appropriate
   consultations were identified, of which 241 were timely (65.7\%). The
   mean cost of a RCH consultation was A\$431.29, with the mean TD consult
   costing A\$294.35. This represents a cost saving of A\$136.95 per
   appointment. The CEA found TD to be a dominant option, with cost savings
   of A\$3,160.81 for every additional timely consult. The model indicated
   that 36.7 days of clinic time may be freed up at the RCH to treat other
   patients and expand capacity. These results were robust when performing
   one-way sensitivity analysis.Conclusion:When taking a societal
   perspective, the implementation of TD is likely to be a cost-effective
   alternative compared with the standard practice of face-to-face
   consultation at the RCH.}},

Abstract = {{The RealSense F200 represents a new generation of economically viable
   4-dimensional imaging (4D) systems for home use. However, its 3D
   geometric (depth) accuracy has not been clinically tested. Therefore,
   this study determined the depth accuracy of the RealSense, in a cohort
   of patients with a unilateral facial palsy (n = 34), by using the
   clinically validated 3dMD system as a gold standard. The patients were
   simultaneously recorded with both systems, capturing six Sunnybrook
   poses. This study has shown that the RealSense depth accuracy was not
   affected by a facial palsy (1.48 +/- 0.28 mm), compared to a healthy
   face (1.46 +/- 0.26 mm). Furthermore, the Sunnybrook poses did not
   influence the RealSense depth accuracy (p = 0.76). However, the distance
   of the patients to the RealSense was shown to affect the accuracy of the
   system, where the highest depth accuracy of 1.07 mm was measured at a
   distance of 35 cm. Overall, this study has shown that the RealSense can
   provide reliable and accurate depth data when recording a range of
   facial movements. Therefore, when the portability, low-costs, and
   availability of the RealSense are taken into consideration, the camera
   is a viable option for 4D close range imaging in telehealth.}},

Title = {{Public Perception of Telemedicine and Surgical Telementoring in the
   Pediatric Population: Results of a Parental Survey}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LAPAROENDOSCOPIC \& ADVANCED SURGICAL TECHNIQUES}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Telemedicine and surgical telementoring strive to provide
   equal access to specialized healthcare, regardless of patient location.
   It also aims to provide providers in remote locations real-time, second
   opinions from more experienced physicians who are otherwise not readily
   available. The goal of this study is to gauge the public perception of
   this technology in the pediatric population. Methods: Patient families
   in our pediatric surgery and gastroenterology clinics were asked to
   complete a seven-question survey after being shown a 1-minute video
   describing telemedicine and surgical telementoring. Results: A total of
   129 people were surveyed. Among respondents, 89\% were amenable to
   telemedicine for routine physician visit, 70\% said yes for a
   postoperative visit, and 67\% agreed to telemedicine and telementoring
   as a way to be evaluated by a specialist. Regarding surgical
   telementoring, 49\% would consider it for their child, 58\% would
   consider it for themselves, and 10\% said yes for themselves, but no for
   their child. In addition, 24\% and 19\% were unsure about surgical
   telementoring for their child and themselves, respectively. Those with
   history of surgery without complications were more likely to say yes
   than no to telemedicine for a postoperative visit and surgical
   telementoring. Although a higher proportion of those with an annual
   income of >\$100K said no to surgical telementoring for their child and
   themselves, this was not statistically significant (P=.23 and .25,
   respectively). Desire to see a physician in person was cited by 63\% as
   a reason against telemedicine, although 35\% reported concern about a
   physician's competence as a reason against surgical telementoring.
   Conclusion: Overall, surgical telementoring was only supported by about
   half of the respondents. We predict that with increased education about
   surgical telementoring, this technology will have increased public
   support in the pediatric population.}},

Title = {{Integrating acute stroke telemedicine consultations into specialists'
   usual practice: a qualitative analysis comparing the experience of
   Australia and the United Kingdom}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Stroke telemedicine can reduce healthcare inequities by
   increasing access to specialists. Successful telemedicine networks
   require specialists adapting clinical practice to provide remote
   consultations. Variation in experiences of specialists between different
   countries is unknown. To support future implementation, we compared
   perceptions of Australian and United Kingdom specialists providing
   remote acute stroke consultations.
   Methods: Specialist participants were identified using purposive
   sampling from two new services: Australia's Victorian Stroke
   Telemedicine Program (n = 6; 2010-13) and the United Kingdom's Cumbria
   and Lancashire telestroke network (n = 5; 2010-2012). Semi-structured
   interviews were conducted pre- and post-implementation, recorded and
   transcribed verbatim. Deductive thematic and content analysis (NVivo)
   was undertaken by two independent coders using Normalisation Process
   Theory to explore integration of telemedicine into practice. Agreement
   between coders was M = 91\%, SD = 9 and weighted average kappa = 0.70.
   Results: Cross-cultural similarities and differences were found. In both
   countries, specialists described old and new consulting practices, the
   purpose and value of telemedicine systems, and concerns regarding
   confidence in the assessment and diagnostic skills of unknown colleagues
   requesting telemedicine support. Australian specialists discussed how
   remote consultations impacted on usual roles and suggested future
   improvements, while United Kingdom specialists discussed system
   governance, policy and procedures.
   Conclusion: Australian and United Kingdom specialists reported
   telemedicine required changes in work practice and development of new
   skills. Both groups described potential for improvements in stroke
   telemedicine systems with Australian specialists more focused on role
   change and the United Kingdom on system governance issues. Future
   research should examine if cross-cultural variation reflects different
   models of care and extends to other networks.}},

Title = {{Implementation and Evaluation of an Economic Model for Telestroke:
   Experience from Virtuall, France}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Telestroke is recognized as a safe and time-efficient way of
   treating stroke patients. However, admission centers (spokes) are
   subject to financial charges which can make them reluctant to join the
   system. We implemented and assessed an economic model supporting our
   telestroke system, Virtuall, France, which includes one expert center
   (hub) and six spokes.
   Methods: The model is based on payment for the expertise provided by the
   hub, distribution of charges related to telemedicine according to the
   fees perceived by the spokes, and transfer of patients between the
   spokes and the hub. We performed a cost-benefit analysis for all
   patients included in Virtuall from January 2014 to December 2015 to
   assess the economic balance in each center.
   Results: 321 patients were prospectively included in the study.
   Application of the economic model resulted in overall financial balance
   with funding of a dedicated medical service in the hub, and reduced
   costs directly related to telestroke by an average of 10\% in the
   spokes. The conditions generating the highest costs for the spokes were:
   a patient returning from the hub for re-hospitalization (mean cost of
   \$1,995/patient); management of patients treated by intravenous
   thrombolysis without transfer to the hub (mean cost of \$2,075/patient).
   The most favorable financial condition for the spokes remained simple
   transfer of patients to the hub and no return (mean cost of
   \$329/patient).
   Conclusion: We describe an economic model which can be applied to any
   telestroke system to ensure the optimal balance between hub and spoke
   centers.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of antimicrobial stewardship program is a pivotal
   practice element for healthcare institution. We developed a remote
   infectious disease consultancy program via telemedicine in a
   high-specialized pediatric cardiac hospital. A consultation for
   antibiotic strategy for each patient was available via telemedicine in
   addition to biweekly discussion of all clinical cases. Aim of this study
   was to evaluate the impact of the remote stewardship program in terms of
   a) appropriateness of antibiotic prescription; b) incidence of
   multi-resistant infection; and c) cost. A `before - after' study was
   performed comparing the period immediately before starting the program
   and one year after. There was a trend in the reduction of nosocomial
   infectious disease rate (9.5 vs 6.5 per 1000 person days), with a
   reduction in the overall antibiotic cost (25,000 vs 15,000 EUR) and in
   the average antibiotics packages used per admission (9 vs 6.7 packages).
   A significant reduction in the multi-drug resistant isolation rate was
   observed (104 vs 79 per 1000 person days, p = 0.01). In conclusion, the
   infectious disease meeting via telemedicine has been an effective tool
   for economic and professional development and multidisciplinary
   management of complex patients. The appropriate use of antibiotics
   reduced the multi-drug resistant bacteria selection, thus improving
   patient safety.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To survey AOAN member countries regarding their
   organizational structure, postgraduate neurology training program, and
   resources for neurological care provision.
   Methodology: A cross-sectional survey using a 36-item questionnaire was
   conducted among country representatives to AOAN from August 2015 to
   August 2016.
   Results: A total of 18/20 AOAN member countries participated in the
   survey. All the countries have organized association with regular
   meetings, election of officers and neurology training program. In 9/18
   countries, professionals other than neurologists were eligible for
   affiliation. In 11/18 countries, prior Internal medicine training (or
   equivalent postgraduate housemanship) is prerequisite to neurology
   program. Recertification examination is not a practice, but submission
   of CME is required in 7/18 countries to maintain membership. 12/18
   countries publish peer-reviewed journals with at least 1 issue per year.
   Subspecialty training is offered in 14/18 countries. The ratio of
   neurologist to population ranges from 1:14,000 to as low as 1:32 million
   with 9/18 having < 1 neurologist per 100,000 population. 6/18 countries
   have at least 1 specialized center solely for neurological diseases. In
   government-funded hospitals, the lag time to be seen by a neurologist
   and/or obtain neuroimaging scan ranges from 1 day to 3 months. All
   except one country have several medical- and lay-advocacy or support
   groups for different neurological conditions.
   Implications: The data generated can be used for benchmarking to improve
   neurological care, training, collaborative work and research in the
   field of neurosciences among the AOAN member countries. The paper
   presented several strategies used by the different organizations to
   increase their number of neurologists and improve the quality of
   training. Sharing of best practices, academic networking, exchange
   programs and use of telemedicine have been suggested.}},

Title = {{Improving diagnostic sensitivity of combined dermoscopy and reflectance
   confocal microscopy imaging through double reader concordance evaluation
   in telemedicine settings: A retrospective study of 1000 equivocal cases}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an imaging device that permits
   non-invasive visualization of cellular morphology and has been shown to
   improve diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopically equivocal cutaneous
   lesions. The application of double reader concordance evaluation of
   dermoscopy-RCM image sets in retrospective settings and its potential
   application to telemedicine evaluation has not been tested in a large
   study population.
   Objective
   To improve diagnostic sensitivity of RCM image diagnosis using a double
   reader concordance evaluation approach; to reduce mismanagement of
   equivocal cutaneous lesions in retrospective consultation and
   telemedicine settings. Methods 1000 combined dermoscopy-RCM image sets
   were evaluated in blind by 10 readers with advanced training and
   internship in dermoscopy and RCM evaluation. We compared sensitivity and
   specificity of single reader evaluation versus double reader concordance
   evaluation as well as the effect of diagnostic confidence on lesion
   management in a retrospective setting.
   Results
   Single reader evaluation resulted in an overall sensitivity of 95.2\%
   and specificity of 76.3\%, with misdiagnosis of 8 melanomas, 4 basal
   cell carcinomas and 2 squamous cell carcinomas. Combined double reader
   evaluation resulted in an overall sensitivity of 98.3\% and specificity
   of 65.5\%, with misdiagnosis of 1 in-situ melanoma and 2 basal cell
   carcinomas.
   Conclusion
   Evaluation of dermoscopy-RCM image sets of cutaneous lesions by single
   reader evaluation in retrospective settings is limited by sensitivity
   levels that may result in potential mismanagement of malignant lesions.
   Double reader blind concordance evaluation may improve the sensitivity
   of diagnosis and management safety. The use of a second check can be
   implemented in telemedicine settings where expert consultation and
   second opinions may be required.}},

Abstract = {{Telehealth and remote monitoring of a patient's health status has become
   more commonplace in the last decade and has been applied to conditions
   such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease. Conversely, uptake of these technologies
   to help engender and support home RRTs has lagged. Although studies have
   looked at the role of telehealth in RRT, they are small and
   single-centered, and both outcome and cost-effectiveness data are needed
   to inform future decision making. Furthermore, alignment of payer and
   government (federal and state) regulations with telehealth procedures is
   needed along with a better understanding of the viewpoints of the
   various stakeholders in this process (patients, caregivers, clinicians,
   payers, dialysis organizations, and government regulators). Despite
   these barriers, telehealth has great potential to increase the
   acceptance of home dialysis, and improve outcomes and patient
   satisfaction while potentially decreasing costs. The Kidney Health
   Initiative convened a multidisciplinary workgroup to examine the current
   state of telehealth use in home RRTs as well as outline potential
   benefits and drawbacks, impediments to implementation, and key
   unanswered questions.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Telehealth Interventions on Quality of Life of Cancer
   Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Introduction:In 2016, approximate to 1.7 million new cases of cancer
   were diagnosed. Cancer patients can have physical, functional, and
   psychosocial issues when dealing with cancer treatment. Telehealth has
   been effectively introduced to help deliver treatment to patients
   suffering from chronic disease; however, there is little consensus on
   its effectiveness in administering sociobehavioral cancer treatments.
   Thus, this study determines the benefits of telehealth-based
   interventions providing emotional and symptom support in improving
   quality of life (QOL) among cancer patients.
   Methods:Two researchers conducted comprehensive searches on PubMed,
   SCOPUS, Medline, PsycINFO, ERIC, Psychology and Behavioral Collection,
   and Medline Complete. Key search terms included telehealth or
   telemedicine and QOL and cancer. Articles were included if they assessed
   a telehealth-delivered intervention for adult cancer patients and
   provided a QOL assessment. Data were extracted to calculate mean effect
   sizes for QOL measures on the effectiveness of telehealth relative to
   usual care (UC) for cancer treatments.Results:Out of 414 articles
   identified in our initial search, nine articles fit our inclusion
   criteria. Both telehealth (Hedges g=0.211, p=0.016) and standard of care
   (Hedges g=0.217, p < 0.001) cancer treatment delivery methods
   demonstrated small, but statistically significant improvements in QOL
   measures. However, there were no statistically significant differences
   in effectiveness between the telehealth interventions and UC (p=0.76).
   Conclusions:The results indicate that telehealth interventions are as
   effective at improving QOL scores in patients undergoing cancer
   treatment as in-person UC. Further studies should be undertaken on
   different modalities of telehealth to determine its appropriate and
   effective use in interventions to improve the QOL for cancer patients
   undergoing treatment.}},

Title = {{Use of Short Message Service and Smartphone Applications in the
   Management of Surgical Patients: A Systematic Review}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Mobile health and telemedicine are rapidly evolving fields
   used to provide healthcare remotely to patients. For surgical patients,
   telemedicine can improve patient education and remote monitoring of
   postoperative symptoms. We performed a systematic review of studies
   involving the use of short message service (SMS) and mobile
   application-based interventions in surgical patients to evaluate the
   advantages and disadvantages of each system, as well as of mobile
   interventions as a whole.
   Materials and Methods:Major electronic databases were searched using
   relevant keywords from inception until November 2016. Studies involving
   SMS or mobile application-based communication protocols involving at
   least 25 preoperative or postoperative patients were included. Studies
   of systems involving communication exclusively between healthcare
   professionals were excluded.
   Results:A total of 2,492 unique studies were identified through keyword
   search. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 studies were
   included in this review. Intervention modalities were SMS (8 studies),
   mobile application (4), combined SMS and application (1), automated
   phone call (1), and electronic transmission of pictures to the physician
   (1). Intervention methods were symptom monitoring (7), patient education
   (2), protocol adherence reminders (4), and combined symptom monitoring
   and protocol adherence reminders (2). Both mobile applications and
   SMS-based interventions increased adherence to medications and protocols
   and improved clinic attendance. Lower readmission rates and emergency
   room visits were reported. Satisfaction with automated communication
   systems was high for both patients and physicians.
   Conclusions:Mobile interventions provide a sophisticated yet simple tool
   to improve perioperative healthcare. Future considerations to address
   include usage fatigue and Health Insurance Portability and
   Accountability Act compliance concerns.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives mHealth offers a new opportunity to ensure
   access to qualified healthcare providers. Therefore, to better
   understand its potential in Bangladesh, it is important to understand
   how young people use mobile phones for healthcare. Here we examine the
   knowledge, attitudes and intentions to use mHealth services among young
   population.
   Design Population based cross sectional household survey.
   Setting and participants A total of 4909 respondents, aged 18 years and
   above, under the Chakaria Health and Demographic Surveillance System
   (HDSS) area, were interviewed during the period November 2012 to April
   2013.
   Methods Participants younger than 30 years of age were defined as young
   (or generation Y). To examine the level of knowledge about and intention
   towards mHealth services in generation Y compared with their older
   counterparts, the percentage of the respective outcome measure from a
   2x2 contingency table and adjusted odds ratio (aOR), which controls for
   potential confounders such as mobile ownership, sex, education,
   occupation and socioeconomic status, were estimated. The aOR was
   estimated using both the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel approach and
   multivariable logistic regression models controlling for confounders.
   Results Generation Y had significantly greater access to mobile phones
   (50\% vs40\%) and better knowledge about its use for healthcare (37.8\%
   vs27.5\%; aOR 1.6 (95\% CI1.3 to 2.0)). Furthermore, the level of
   knowledge about two existing mHealth services in generation Y was
   significantly higher compared with their older counterparts, with aOR
   values of 3.2 (95\% CI 2.6 to 5.5) and 1.5 (95\% CI 1.1 to 1.8),
   respectively. Similarly, generation Y showed significantly greater
   intention towards future use of mHealth services compared with their
   older counterparts (aOR 1.3 (95\% CI 1.1 to 1.4)). The observed
   associations were not modified by sociodemographic factors.
   Conclusion There is a greater potential for mHealth services in the
   future among young people compared with older age groups. However, given
   the low overall use of mHealth, appropriate policy measures need to be
   formulated to enhance availability, access, utilisation and
   effectiveness of mHealth services.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In an effort to reduce health-care disparities, there has
   been a recent surge of interest in the remote provision of care.
   Audiologists have begun to provide screening, diagnostic, and
   rehabilitative services via telehealth technologies.
   Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility and perceived benefits of providing
   remote hearing aid follow-up appointments in a controlled clinical
   environment and in participants' homes.
   Research Design: A descriptive quasi-experimental study was completed.
   Study Sample: The study consisted of two phases. The in-clinic phase
   included 50 adults with hearing loss who participated in remote hearing
   aid follow-up appointments at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. A
   subgroup of 21 adults from the original in-clinic phase plus one
   additional participant completed the in-home appointments.
   Data Collection and Analysis: All participants completed the Montreal
   Cognitive Assessment and study-designed questionnaires. All participants
   were asked to install proprietary distance support (DS) client software
   on a laptop or desktop computer and participate in hearing aid follow-up
   appointments.
   Results: The majority of participants in both groups installed the DS
   client software with no assistance other than written instructions, and
   indicated a preference for DS appointments over face-to-face
   appointments.
   Conclusion: On average, participants and the study audiologist were
   satisfied with remote hearing aid follow-up visits. Additional support
   might be needed for older patients with little confidence in their
   ability to interact with technology.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Error avoidance in medicine follows similar rules that apply within the
   design and operation of other complex systems. The error-reduction
   concepts that best fit the conduct of testing during intraoperative
   neuromonitoring are forgiving design (reversibility of signal loss to
   avoid/prevent injury) and system redundancy (reduction of false reports
   by the multiplication of the error rate of tests independently assessing
   the same structure). However, error reduction in intraoperative
   neuromonitoring is complicated by the dichotomous roles (and biases) of
   the neurophysiologist (test recording and interpretation) and surgeon
   (intervention). This ``interventional cascade{''} can be given as
   follows: test -> interpretation -> communication -> intervention ->
   outcome. Observational and controlled trials within operating rooms
   demonstrate that optimized communication, collaboration, and situational
   awareness result in fewer errors. Well-functioning operating room
   collaboration depends on familiarity and trust among colleagues.
   Checklists represent one method to initially enhance communication and
   avoid obvious errors. All intraoperative neuromonitoring supervisors
   should strive to use sufficient means to secure situational awareness
   and trusted communication/collaboration. Face-to-face audiovisual
   teleconnections may help repair deficiencies when a particular practice
   model disallows personal operating room availability. All supervising
   intraoperative neurophysiologists need to reject an insular or
   deferential or distant mindset.}},

   challenges, may interact with telemedicine differently than their adult
   counterparts. Maximizing the benefits of teledermatology in pediatric
   dermatologic care is dependent on future research. We review and analyze
   the commonalities and differences between pediatric and adult patient
   care using teledermatology. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe Home Monitoring (HM) system of cardiac implantable
   electronic devices (CIEDs) permits early detection of arrhythmias or
   device system failures. The aim of this pilot study was to examine how
   the safety and efficacy of the HM system in patients after ambulatory
   implanted primary CIEDs compare to patients with a standard procedure
   and hospitalization.
   HypothesisWe hypothesized that HM and their modifications would be a
   useful extension of the present concepts for ambulatory implanted CIEDs.
   MethodsThis retrospective analysis evaluates telemetric data obtained
   from 364 patients in an ambulatory single center over 6years. Patients
   were assigned to an active group (n=217), consisting of those who were
   discharged early on the day of implantation of the primary CIED, or to a
   control group (n=147), consisting of those discharged and followed up
   with the HM system according to usual medical practices.
   ResultsThe mean duration of hospitalization was 73.2\% shorter in the
   active group than in the control group, corresponding to 20.513 fewer
   hours (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 6.3-29.5; P<0.01) spent in the
   hospital (7.5 +/- 1.5 vs 28 +/- 4.5h). This shorter mean hospital stay
   was attributable to a 78.8\% shorter postoperative period in the active
   group. The proportion of patients with treatment-related adverse events
   was 11\% (n=23) in the active group and 17\% (n=25) in the control group
   (95\% CI: 5.5-8.3; P=0.061). This 6\% absolute risk reduction (95\% CI:
   3.3-9.1; P=0.789) confirmed the noninferiority of the ambulatory
   implanted CIED when compared with standard management of these patients.
   ConclusionsEarly discharge with the HM system after ambulatory CIED
   implantation was safe and not inferior to the classic medical procedure.
   Thus, together with lower costs, HM and its modifications would be a
   useful extension of the present concepts for ambulatory implanted CIEDs.}},

Title = {{Non-Contact Sensor for Long-Term Continuous Vital Signs Monitoring: A
   Review on Intelligent Phased-Array Doppler Sensor Design}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{It has been the dream of many scientists and engineers to realize a
   non-contact remote sensing system that can perform continuous, accurate
   and long-term monitoring of human vital signs as we have seen in many
   Sci-Fi movies. Having an intelligible sensor system that can measure and
   record key vital signs (such as heart rates and respiration rates)
   remotely and continuously without touching the patients, for example,
   can be an invaluable tool for physicians who need to make rapid
   life-and-death decisions. Such a sensor system can also effectively help
   physicians and patients making better informed decisions when patients'
   long-term vital signs data is available. Therefore, there has been a lot
   of research activities on developing a non-contact sensor system that
   can monitor a patient's vital signs and quickly transmit the information
   to healthcare professionals. Doppler-based radio-frequency (RF)
   non-contact vital signs (NCVS) monitoring system are particularly
   attractive for long term vital signs monitoring because there are no
   wires, electrodes, wearable devices, nor any contact-based sensors
   involved so the subjects may not be even aware of the ubiquitous
   monitoring. In this paper, we will provide a brief review on some latest
   development on NCVS sensors and compare them against a few novel and
   intelligent phased-array Doppler-based RF NCVS biosensors we have built
   in our labs. Some of our NCVS sensor tests were performed within a
   clutter-free anechoic chamber to mitigate the environmental clutters,
   while most tests were conducted within the typical Herman-Miller type
   office cubicle setting to mimic a more practical monitoring environment.
   Additionally, we will show the measurement data to demonstrate the
   feasibility of long-term NCVS monitoring. The measured data strongly
   suggests that our latest phased array NCVS system should be able to
   perform long-term vital signs monitoring intelligently and robustly,
   especially for situations where the subject is sleeping without hectic
   movements nearby.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Advancements in medical science and technology, medicine and public
   health coupled with increased consciousness about nutrition and
   environmental and personal hygiene have paved the way for the dramatic
   increase in life expectancy globally in the past several decades.
   However, increased life expectancy has given rise to an increasing aging
   population, thus jeopardizing the socio-economic structure of many
   countries in terms of costs associated with elderly healthcare and
   wellbeing. In order to cope with the growing need for elderly healthcare
   services, it is essential to develop affordable, unobtrusive and
   easy-to-use healthcare solutions. Smart homes, which incorporate
   environmental and wearable medical sensors, actuators, and modern
   communication and information technologies, can enable continuous and
   remote monitoring of elderly health and wellbeing at a low cost. Smart
   homes may allow the elderly to stay in their comfortable home
   environments instead of expensive and limited healthcare facilities.
   Healthcare personnel can also keep track of the overall health condition
   of the elderly in real-time and provide feedback and support from
   distant facilities. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive
   review on the state-of-the-art research and development in smart home
   based remote healthcare technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diabetic
   retinopathy (DR) tele-ophthalmology screening program in Manitoba to
   determine prevalence and incidence of DR, as well as to estimate the
   program's cost-effectiveness.
   Design: Retrospective chart review.
   Participants: A total of 4676 patients with type 2 diabetes examined
   9334 times from 2007 to 2013.
   Methods: Focused ophthalmic histories were recorded and examinations
   were performed by trained nurses, including visual acuities, intraocular
   pressure, and mydriatic 7 standard field stereoscopic fundus
   photography. Images were evaluated by retinal specialists according to
   the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study criteria. DR
   prevalence and incidence were then calculated during the study period.
   Cost-effectiveness was estimated by comparing the cost of running the
   tele-ophthalmology program compared with the cost of screening the same
   volume of patients in-office.
   Results: The average prevalence of any DR in each year was 25.1\%. The
   cumulative incidence of DR across 6 years was 17.1\% (95\% CI,
   15.4\%-18.7\%). The average savings per tele-ophthalmology examination
   was \$1007.
   Conclusions: DR is highly prevalent among the studied population.
   Tele-ophthalmology provides a cost-effective means of monitoring
   patients as well as identifying new or treatable disease.}},

Abstract = {{This review aimed to identify research that described how eHealth
   facilitates interdisciplinary cancer care and to understand the ways in
   which eHealth innovations are being used in this setting. An integrative
   review of eHealth interventions used for interdisciplinary care for
   people with cancer was conducted by systematically searching research
   databases in March 2015, and repeated in September 2016. Searches
   resulted in 8531 citations, of which 140 were retrieved and scanned in
   full, with twenty-six studies included in the review. Analysis of data
   extracted from the included articles revealed five broad themes: (i)
   data collection and accessibility; (ii) virtual multidisciplinary teams;
   (iii) communication between individuals involved in the delivery of
   health services; (iv) communication pathways between patients and cancer
   care teams; and (v) health professional-led change. Use of eHealth
   interventions in cancer care was widespread, particularly to support
   interdisciplinary care. However, research has focused on development and
   implementation of interventions, rather than on long-term impact.
   Further research is warranted to explore design, evaluation, and
   long-term sustainability of eHealth systems and interventions in
   interdisciplinary cancer care. Technology evolves quickly and
   researchers need to provide health professionals with timely guidance on
   how best to respond to new technologies in the health sector.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of transmitted drug
   resistance (TDR)-associated mutations among treatment-naive,
   incarcerated individuals with HIV-1 infection in the USA as well as the
   class TDR and antiretroviral (ARV) mutations present at baseline.
   Methods
   Patients over the age of 18 years were included in the study if they had
   been diagnosed with HIV infection, if their HIV infection was managed
   through telemedicine and if they were incarcerated in the State of
   Illinois Department of Corrections between 10 July 2010 and 29 April
   2016. Additionally, the patients were required to have a documented
   genotype and be ARV-naive. A medical chart review was conducted to
   assess demographic information, disease burden, and risk factors for
   acquiring the virus.
   Results
   The inclusion criteria were met for 105 patients. A total of 24 patients
   (23\%) had a clinically significant mutation associated with resistance
   to any drug class. The prevalence of mutations conferring clinically
   significant resistance was 19\% for nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase
   inhibitors (NNRTIs), 18\% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase
   inhibitors (NRTIs), and 4\% for protease inhibitors (PIs). Five per cent
   of patients had dual-class TDR to both NRTI and NNRTI drug classes and
   2\% of patients had mutations to both NNRTI and PI drug classes. There
   was no significant increase in the prevalence of clinically relevant
   drug resistance mutations based on demographics, burden of disease, or
   risk factors for acquiring the virus.
   Conclusions
   A high prevalence of TDR was identified in the ARV-naive incarcerated
   population. The results of this study indicate an increased prevalence
   of TDR in a largely unstudied incarcerated population, demonstrating the
   need for increased monitoring of resistance in HIV-infected patients
   world-wide.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Stroke is a very time-sensitive pathology, and many new
   solutions target the optimization of prehospital stroke care to improve
   the stroke management process. In-ambulance telemedicine, defined by
   live bidirectional audio-video between a patient and a neurologist in a
   moving ambulance and the automated transfer of vital parameters, is a
   promising new approach to speed up and improve the quality of acute
   stroke care. Currently, no evidence exists on the cost effectiveness of
   in-ambulance telemedicine.
   Objective: We aim to develop a first cost effectiveness model for
   in-ambulance telemedicine and use this model to estimate the time
   savings needed before in-ambulance telemedicine becomes cost effective.
   Methods: Current standard stroke care is compared with current standard
   stroke care supplemented with in-ambulance telemedicine using a
   cost-utility model measuring costs and quality-adjusted life-years
   (QALYs) from a health care perspective. We combine a decision tree with
   a Markov model. Data from the UZ Brussel Stroke Registry (2282 stroke
   patients) and linked hospital claims data at individual level are
   combined with literature data to populate the model. A 2-way sensitivity
   analysis varying both implementation costs and time gain is performed to
   map the different cost-effective combinations and identify the time gain
   needed for cost effectiveness and dominance. For several modeled time
   gains, the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve is calculated and
   mapped in 1 figure.
   Results: Under the base-case scenario (implementation cost of US \$
   159,425) and taking a lifetime horizon into account, in-ambulance
   telemedicine is a cost-effective strategy compared to standard stroke
   care alone starting from a time gain of 6 minutes. After 12 minutes,
   in-ambulance telemedicine becomes dominant, and this results in a mean
   decrease of costs by US -\$ 30 (95\% CI -\$ 32 to -\$ 29) per patient
   with 0.00456 (95\% CI 0.00448 to 0.00463) QALYs on average gained per
   patient. In over 82\% of all probabilistic simulations, in-ambulance
   telemedicine remains under the cost-effectiveness threshold of US \$
   47,747.
   Conclusions: Our model suggests that in-ambulance telemedicine can be
   cost effective starting from a time gain of 6 minutes and becomes a
   dominant strategy after approximately 15 minutes. This indicates that
   in-ambulance telemedicine has the potential to become a cost-effective
   intervention assuming time gains in clinical implementations are
   realized in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the relationship between pediatric critical care
   telemedicine consultation to rural emergency departments and triage
   decisions. We compare the triage location and provider rating of the
   accuracy of remote assessment for a cohort of patients who receive
   critical care telemedicine consultations and a similar group of patients
   receiving telephone consultations.
   Design: Retrospective evaluation of consultations occurring between
   April 2012 and March 2016.
   Setting: Pediatric critical care telemedicine and telephone
   consultations in 52 rural healthcare settings in South Carolina.
   Patients: Pediatric patients receiving critical care telemedicine or
   telephone consultations.
   Intervention: Telemedicine consultations.
   Measurements and Main Results: Data were collected from the consulting
   provider for 484 total consultations by telephone or telemedicine. We
   examined the providers' self-reported assessments about the
   consultation, decision-making, and triage outcomes. We estimate a logit
   model to predict triage location as a function of telemedicine consult
   age and sex. For telemedicine patients, the odds of triage to a non-ICU
   level of care are 2.55 times larger than the odds for patients receiving
   telephone consultations (p = 0.0005). Providers rated the accuracy of
   their assessments higher when consultations were provided via
   telemedicine. When patients were transferred to a non-ICU location
   following a telemedicine consultation, providers indicated that the use
   of telemedicine influenced the triage decision in 95.7\% of cases (p <
   0.001). For patients transferred to a non-ICU location, an increase in
   transfers to a higher level of care within 24 hours was not observed.
   Conclusion: Pediatric critical care telemedicine consultation to
   community hospitals is feasible and results in a reduction in PICU
   admissions. This study demonstrates an improvement in provider-reported
   accuracy of patient assessment via telemedicine compared with telephone,
   which may produce a higher comfort level with transporting patients to a
   lower level of care. Pediatric critical care telemedicine consultations
   represent a promising means of improving care and reducing costs for
   critically ill children in rural areas.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The study examined the cost-effectiveness of a
   telemedicine-based collaborative care model designed to increase rural
   veterans' engagement in evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD).
   Methods: The Telemedicine Outreach for PTSD (TOP) study used a pragmatic
   randomized effectiveness trial to examine effects of PTSD care teams
   located at Veterans Affairs medical centers and supporting primary care
   providers in satellite clinics. Teams included a nurse care manager,
   pharmacist, psychologist, and psychiatrist. Effectiveness was estimated
   with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from the Short Form
   Health Survey for Veterans and Quality of Well-Being (QWB) scale.
   Intervention and health care costs were collected to evaluate the
   cost-effectiveness of the intervention.
   Results: The sample (N=265) included mostly rural, unemployed,
   middle-aged men with a military service-connected disability for PTSD
   randomly assigned to TOP or usual care. Only minor improvements in QWB
   QALYs were found. The TOP intervention was relatively expensive, with
   costs totaling \$2,029 per patient per year. Intervention costs were not
   offset by reductions in health care utilization costs, resulting in an
   incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \$185,565 per QALY
   (interquartile range \$57,675 to \$395,743).
   Conclusions: Because of the upfront training costs and the
   resource-intensive nature of this intervention, associated expenses were
   high. Although PTSD-specific effectiveness measures were significantly
   improved, these changes did not translate to QALYs in the main analysis.
   However, analyses focusing on patient subgroups with comorbid mental
   disorders indicated greater QALY improvement for TOP at lower cost.}},

Title = {{Telemonitoring in continuous positive airway pressure-treated patients
   improves delay to first intervention and early compliance: a randomized
   trial}},
Journal = {{SLEEP MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{77-83}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Telemonitoring (TM) has been used in continuous positive
   airway pressure (CPAP)-treated patients to improve compliance, but
   results have been inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to assess
   the impact of TM on the delay to the first technical intervention after
   CPAP initiation. The impact of TM on mean compliance during the first 3
   months of treatment was measured as a secondary outcome.
   Methods: Patients diagnosed with moderate to severe obstructive sleep
   apnea syndrome were prospectively included and randomized to receive
   usual care (UC) or TM. In both arms, an educational session was
   scheduled 1 month after CPAP initiation, and medical visits were planned
   after 1.5 and 3 months. In the TM arm, we added a universal TM unit
   (T4P) to the CPAP device.
   Results: Delay to first intervention was significantly shorter in the TM
   group (29 +/- 25 vs 47 +/- 30 days, p = 0.02). The first intervention in
   the TM group was motivated by detection of problems by the TM system in
   39\% of patients. Compliance at 3 months was significantly better in the
   TM group (5.7 +/- 1.6 vs 4.2 +/- 1.9 h/night, p = 0.018).
   Conclusion: This is the first randomized study showing that TM reduces
   delay to first technical intervention in CPAP-treated patients. This
   early activation of troubleshooting was associated with improved
   compliance at 3 months. Since CPAP side effects at 1 month have been
   shown to predict lower 12-month CPAP compliance, TM seems to be an
   excellent tool for improvement of long-term CPAP acceptance. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Introduction. Health care access for medically underserved patients
   managing chronic conditions is challenging. While telemedicine can
   support patient education and engagement, the ``digital divide{''} may
   be particularly problematic among the medically underserved. This study
   evaluated physical access to digital devices, use of e-mail and social
   media tools, and perceptions of telemedicine among American Indian (AI)
   patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods. Survey data were
   collected from AI patients with DM during teleophthalmology exams.
   Results. Eighty-eight percent of patients had access to digital
   device(s), 70\% used e-mail, and 56\% used social media. Younger age and
   greater education were positively associated with e-mail and social
   media use (p<.05). Most (60\%) considered telemedicine an excellent
   medium for health-related patient education. Discussion. American Indian
   patients with DM had access enabling patient education via telemedicine.
   Future work should examine patient technology preferences and
   effectiveness of technology-based education in improving outcomes among
   medically underserved populations.}},

   Observational Study of Diagnostic Relevance and Clinical Outcomes}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: The use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)
   and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices is expanding in the
   treatment of heart failure. Most of the current devices are equipped
   with remote monitoring functions, including bioimpedance for fluid
   status monitoring. The question remains whether bioimpedance
   measurements positively impact clinical outcome.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview
   of the clinical interventions taken based on remote bioimpedance
   monitoring alerts and their impact on clinical outcome.
   Methods: This is a single-center observational study of consecutive ICD
   and CRT patients (n=282) participating in protocol-driven remote
   follow-up. Bioimpedance alerts were analyzed with subsequently triggered
   interventions.
   Results: A total of 55.0\% (155/282) of patients had an ICD or CRT
   device equipped with a remote bioimpedance algorithm. During 34 (SD 12)
   months of follow-up, 1751 remote monitoring alarm notifications were
   received (2.2 per patient-year of follow-up), comprising 2096 unique
   alerts (2.6 per patient-year of follow-up). Since 591 (28.2\%) of all
   incoming alerts were bioimpedance-related, patients with an ICD or CRT
   including a bioimpedance algorithm had significantly more alerts (3.4
   versus 1.8 alerts per patient-year of follow-up, P<.001).
   Bioimpedance-only alerts resulted in a phone contact in 91.0\% (498/547)
   of cases, which triggered an actual intervention in 15.9\% (87/547) of
   cases, since in 75.1\% (411/547) of cases reenforcing heart failure
   education sufficed. Overall survival was lower in patients with a
   cardiovascular implantable electronic device with a bioimpedance
   algorithm; however, this difference was driven by differences in
   baseline characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio of 2.118, 95\% CI
   0.845-5.791). No significant differences between both groups were
   observed in terms of the number of follow-up visits in the outpatient
   heart failure clinic, the number of hospital admissions with a primary
   diagnosis of heart failure, or mean length of hospital stay.
   Conclusions: Bioimpedance-only alerts constituted a substantial amount
   of incoming alerts when turned on during remote follow-up and triggered
   an additional intervention in only 16\% of cases since in 75\% of cases,
   providing general heart failure education sufficed. The high frequency
   of heart failure education that was provided could have contributed to
   fewer heart failure-related hospitalizations despite significant
   differences in baseline characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Telemedicine technologies have been presented as solutions to the
   challenges of equitable, cost-effective and efficient health service
   provision for over two decades. The ways in which the sensory dimensions
   of medical care and the doctor-patient relationship are mediated via
   telemedicine can be important contributors to the success, failure or
   unintended consequences of telemedicine. In this article, we present a
   review of the relevant literature in social research that provides
   insights into the sensory dimensions of telemedicine. In addition to
   considering important relevant work undertaken in the sociology of
   health and illness, we incorporate perspectives and research from other
   disciplines and fields that we believe can contribute to the development
   of scholarship on this topic. We contend that when doctors, patients and
   other healthcare workers enact telemedicine, sensory judgements have
   become, in part, a sensing of sensors. Viewing healthcare practitioners
   and patients as always and already digital data assemblages of
   flesh-code-space-place-affect-senses, demanding certain kinds of body
   work and data sense-making, constitutes a productive theoretical
   approach for future enquiries into telemedicine and other digital health

Abstract = {{In this study, we explore the role of telemedicine in reducing
   gender-based barriers women and girls in rural areas of Nepal are facing
   to access healthcare services. Data were collected through a mixed
   method consisting of questionnaires survey, in-depth interviews, and
   focus group discussions with mobile phone and video conference-based
   telemedicine users. Data were analysed through descriptive and thematic
   analysis. Results revealed that telemedicine reduced travel
   restrictions, treatment expenses, and apprehension regarding sexual and
   reproductive health consultation. Moreover, telemedicine decreased
   travel time, which helps women and girls access timely healthcare
   services and improve time management for household chores and other
   activities. The conclusion is that rural telemedicine tends to reduce
   gender-based barriers for women and girls in accessing healthcare
   services. Finally, policy recommendations are provided for expanding
   these initiatives in rural areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and a first evaluation of a new
   monitoring system based on contactless sensors to estimate sleep
   quality. This sensor produces thermal signals which have been used, at
   first, to detect a human presence in the bed and then to estimate sleep
   quality. To distinguish between different sleep phases, we have used
   methods of signal processing in order to extract the necessary features
   for learning an adapted statistical model. The existing monitoring
   systems use sensors attached to the bed or worn by the person. We
   propose in this paper a system based on a passive thermal sensor which
   has the advantage of being fixed on the wall; thus, it is easier to use
   and more reliable. We explain different signal processing steps and
   describe sleep stage recognition algorithms. We propose an adaptation of
   the SAX method for the thermal signal. Finally, we evaluate our system
   in comparison with a polysomnographic recording system in the Hospital
   (CHU) of Limoges.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of thrombolysis or mechanical recanalization for acute
   stroke is higher, the sooner these therapies are started. Therefore,
   acute stroke patients need to be evaluated by qualified staff for these
   therapies as soon as possible. Lay persons need to identify the typical
   symptoms of stroke as an emergency and act accordingly by calling the
   emergency medical system (EMS). The EMS team reassesses the symptoms and
   prompts cerebral imaging. Cerebral imaging is performed ideally in
   hospitals with a stroke unit where subsequent (stroke) treatments occur.
   On the way, the emergency team will measure and stabilize vital
   functions and obtain further important clinical information.
   Telemedicine allows communicating exact time of onset and severity of
   symptoms, as well as comorbidities and medication of the patient to the
   respective hospital. Thereby, the intrahospital workload will be
   disencumbered and accelerated. Some EMS vehicles now carry point-of-care
   laboratories and may measure lab values en route (glucose and INR
   {[}International Normalized Ratio] for example). Some ambulances are not
   only equipped with qualified staff, telemedicine technique, and
   point-of-care labs but even computer tomography (CT) to perform imaging.
   Such mobile stroke emergency mobiles (STEMO) or mobile stroke units may
   perform thrombolysis prehospitally. Prehospital thrombolysis has been
   proven to be initiated faster and is safe. Preliminary results even
   suggest superiority to intrahospital thrombolysis with respect to
   clinical outcome. Moreover, STEMO may perform CT-angiography and assess
   intracranial large-vessel status. If intracranial large-vessel occlusion
   is present, patients will be brought directly to hospitals able to
   perform mechanical recanalization. Thus, secondary transports are no
   longer required.}},

   inhalers, with significant improvements for the albuterol metered-dose
   inhaler, budesonide/ formoterol metered-dose inhaler, and tiotropium dry
   powder inhaler. Improved technique was sustained for nearly all inhalers
   at 1 and 2 months. Quality of life measured with the Chronic Respiratory
   Questionnaire improved following the training: dyspnea (+0.3 points, P <
   .01), fatigue (+ 0.6 points, P < .001), emotional function (+ 0.5
   points, P < .001), and mastery (+ 0.7 points, P < .001). Coping skills
   measured with the Seattle Obstructive Lung Disease Questionnaire
   improved (+9.9 points, P < .003). Participants reported increased
   confidence in inhaler use; for example, mean self-efficacy for using
   albuterol increased 3 points (P < . 001). Inhaler adherence improved
   significantly after the intervention from 1.6 at the initial visit to
   1.1 at month 2 (P < .045). The pharmacist reported technical issues in
   64\% of visits. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaler training using teach-to-goal
   methodology delivered by home videoconference is a promising means to
   provide training to patients with COPD that can improve technique,
   quality of life, self-efficacy, and adherence.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the mode of implementation, clinical outcomes,
   cost-effectiveness, and the factors influencing uptake and
   sustainability of collaborative care for psychiatric disorders in older
   adults.
   Design: Systematic review.
   Setting: Primary care, home health care, seniors' residence, medical
   inpatient and outpatient.
   Participants: Studies with a mean sample age of 60 years and older.
   Intervention: Collaborative care for psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched
   up until October 2016. Individual randomized controlled trials and
   cohort, case-control, and health service evaluation studies were
   selected, and relevant data were extracted for qualitative synthesis.
   Results: Of the 552 records identified, 53 records (from 29 studies)
   were included. Very few studies evaluated psychiatric disorders other
   than depression. The mode of implementation differed based on the
   setting, with beneficial use of telemedicine. Clinical outcomes for
   depression were significantly better compared with usual care across
   settings. In depression, there is some evidence for cost-effectiveness.
   There is limited evidence for improved dementia care and outcomes using
   collaborative care. There is a lack of evidence for benefit in disorders
   other than depression or in settings such as home health care and
   general acute inpatients. Attitudes and skill of primary care staff,
   availability of resources, and organizational support are some of the
   factors influencing uptake and implementation.
   Conclusions: Collaborative care for depressive disorders is feasible and
   beneficial among older adults in diverse settings. There is a paucity of
   studies on collaborative care in conditions other than depression or in
   settings other than primary care, indicating the need for further
   evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Finding innovative and cost-efficient care strategies that
   induce long-term health benefits in cardiac patients constitutes a big
   challenge today. The aim of this Telerehab III follow-up study was to
   assess whether a 6-month additional cardiac telerehabilitation programme
   could induce long-term health benefits and remain cost-efficient after
   the tele-intervention ended.
   Methods and results: A total of 126 cardiac patients first completed the
   multicentre, randomised controlled telerehabilitation trial (Telerehab
   III, time points t(0) to t(1)). They consequently entered the follow-up
   study (t(1)) with evaluations 2 years later (t(2)). A quantitative
   analysis of peak aerobic capacity (VO2 peak, primary endpoint),
   international physical activity questionnaire self-reported physical
   activity and HeartQoL quality of life (secondary endpoints) was
   performed. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. Even
   though a decline in VO2 peak (248ml/{[}min{*}kg] at t(1) and
   226ml/{[}min{*}kg] at t(2); P <= 0.001) was observed within the
   tele-intervention group patients; overall they did better than the no
   tele-intervention group (P=0.032). Dividing the incremental cost
   (-(sic)878/patient) by the differential incremental quality-adjusted
   life years (QALYs) (0.22 QALYs) yielded an incremental
   cost-effectiveness ratio of -(sic)3993/QALY.
   Conclusions: A combined telerehabilitation and centre-based programme,
   followed by transitional telerehabilitation induced persistent health
   benefits and remained cost-efficient up to 2 years after the end of the
   intervention. A partial decline of the benefits originally achieved did
   occur once the tele-intervention ended. Healthcare professionals should
   reflect on how innovative cost-efficient care models could be
   implemented in standard care. Future research should focus on key
   behaviour change techniques in technology-based interventions that
   enable full persistence of long-term behaviour change and health
   benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing disorder
   with significant medical, social and financial impacts. IBD patients
   require continuous follow-up, and healthcare resource use in this
   context increases over time. In the last decade, telemedicine has
   influenced the treatment of chronic diseases like IBD via the
   application of information and communication technologies to provide
   healthcare services remotely. Telemedicine and its various applications
   (telemanagement, teteconsulting and tele-education) enable closer
   follow-up and provide education resources that promote patient
   empowerment, encouraging treatment optimisation over the entire course
   of the disease. We describe the impact of using telemedicine on IBD
   health outcomes and discuss the limitations of implementing these
   systems in the real-life management of IBD patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{BackgroundTelestroke uses videoconferencing technology to allow off-site
   experts to provide stroke thrombolysis decision support to less
   experienced front line clinicians.
   AimTo assess the impact of a new telestroke service on thrombolysis
   rates and door-to-needle times in participating provincial hospitals and
   service resources to aid transition to a sustainable telestroke service.
   MethodsThis is a sequential comparison of pre' (December 2015 to May
   2016) and post' (June 2016 to December 2016) implementation outcomes.
   The main outcomes were thrombolysis rate and door-to-needle time. All
   patient data were captured prospectively in a central database. Data
   captured and analysed also included technical problems, consumer and
   clinician feedback, and additional service resources required.
   ResultsOver the study period, 164 telestroke assessments were completed,
   including the hub' hospital. Among the participating provincial
   hospitals, 21 of 343 patients (6.1\%) were thrombolysed in the 6-months
   prior to June 2016 and 50 of 318 patients (15.7\%) during the 6-month
   following implementation of telestroke; odds ratio 2.86 (95\% confidence
   interval 1.68-4.89); P=0.0001. Overall, mean (standard deviation)
   regional hospital door-to-needle time reduced from 79.6 (31.4) to 62.7
   (23.3) min (P=0.015). Videoconferencing failure occurred in 4.8\% of
   cases. Consumer and clinician feedback was positive. The main resource
   challenge was doubling of out-of-hours neurologist workload.
   ConclusionTelestroke was associated with a significant increase in
   thrombolysis rate and reduction in door-to-needle time in provincial
   hospitals indicating improved patient care. Quantification of the extra
   neurologist workload allowed for a seamless transition to business as
   usual' using a novel annual subscription funding and service model.}},

   Introduction: To ascertain the frequency of correctly managed and
   diagnosed melanomas within a population of veterans in Veterans
   Integrated Service Network 20 SFT.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of
   7,960 veterans seen by SFT between July 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011.
   Results: Of the 61 veterans that met inclusion and exclusion criteria,
   45 (74\%) melanomas were correctly diagnosed and 57 (93\%) were
   correctly managed.
   Discussion: Diagnostic and management accuracy of SFT is comparable to
   FTF. Incorrect diagnosis or management of melanomas did not prove to
   have significant consequences for patient care. Cases subject to
   analysis of this study are not demographically representative of the
   general population.
   Conclusion: Diagnosis and management of melanoma in SFT is comparable to
   FTF care.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Telemonitoring is used for glucose management and support in
   many countries. A better understanding of the differences in
   telemonitoring acceptance based on regional characteristics is needed.
   Therefore, we compared the acceptance of telemonitoring for glucose
   management among patients in South Korea and China.
   Materials and Methods: This study used data from Korean (n = 81) and
   Chinese (n = 92) subjects with type 2 diabetes. We used two independent
   sample t-tests to compare patients' perceptions of telemonitoring and
   multiple regression analysis to determine the factors that affected
   their behavioral intentions to use telemonitoring. We conducted Wilcoxon
   signed rank tests to assess the differences in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
   levels from baseline to follow-up.
   Results: Although Korean and Chinese patients had positive perceptions
   of the services, different factors influenced their behavioral
   intentions to use them. In South Korea, performance expectations and
   social influences were significantly associated with intention to use
   telemonitoring. Patients younger than 50 years showed a significant
   decrease in HbA1c levels at month 6 (p<0.05). In China, effort
   expectancy and facilitating conditions were significantly associated
   with intention to use. In addition, subjects in all age groups exhibited
   a significant decrease in HbA1c levels at all follow-up points
   (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: Telemonitoring was a supportive intervention in improving
   blood sugar levels among patients with diabetes in South Korea and
   China, but the factors influencing its use varied. We provide practical
   guidance for developing telemonitoring for glucose management that
   considers the distinct characteristics of different countries.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pregnancy and birth outcomes are a critical area of
   healthcare, yet negative outcomes like C-sections and preterm births
   remain widespread. Studies show that early and ongoing prenatal care can
   improve outcomes; however, in-person care is difficult to deliver in
   rural areas. This article examines the impact of mobile health
   technology on user engagement and birth outcomes in a Wyoming pilot
   study. The pilot did face some limitations; namely, the small app user
   group size and scant demographic information collected from users.
   Materials and Methods: Wyoming Medicaid contracted with Xerox State
   Healthcare to launch WYhealth Due Date Plus, a pregnancy application by
   Wildflower Health. Pregnant Medicaid members registering for the app and
   providing a Medicaid ID were assigned to the app user group (N = 85).
   The non-app user group consisted of other pregnant Medicaid members with
   delivery outcome records (N = 5, 158). Downloads and utilization
   frequency were tracked to gauge user engagement. Among pregnant Medicaid
   members, data were collected on app usage and four outcomes of
   interest-6-month or more prenatal visit, C-section, low birth weight,
   and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admission-to examine the
   association between app use and pregnancy/birth outcomes. Chi-square
   tests were conducted to analyze associations. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
   was used to assess potential confounding.
   Results: Strong user engagement was observed with over 1,730 downloads.
   App users had a statistically significant association between app usage
   and completion of a 6-month or more prenatal visit (p = 0.022). There
   was a borderline significant association between app use and decreased
   incidence of low birth weight (p = 0.055). Maternal age was not a
   possible confounder.
   Conclusions: Preliminary data indicate that Due Date Plus attracted an
   engaged user base and that app usage was associated with improvements in
   prenatal visit completion and reduced incidence of low-birth weight
   delivery. These promising results suggest broader implementation and
   further study of mobile applications for prenatal support.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Digitalization and patient empowerment result in new
   requirements and challenges. In response, the module Clinical
   Telemedicine/e-Health was implemented by the Faculty of Medicine of
   Zurich in 2008. The module was systematically evaluated to determine if
   the students would benefit from this course. In 2011, 2015, and 2016
   further evaluations were performed.
   Method: In 2008 and 2009, students evaluated 16 statements. We
   calculated the combined mean value and medians for both evaluations. In
   2011, the same evaluation was conducted, and the results were compared
   through U-test. In 2015, students were asked about the application and
   benefits of telemedicine; the answers were analyzed qualitatively and
   quantitatively. In 2016, the University of Zurich created an online
   survey which integrated three of the statements from the original
   evaluations.
   Results: Every mean value of the combined evaluations of 2008/2009,
   2011, and 2016 achieved a score of over 4 on a 6-point scale. In 2011,
   and also again in 2016, the overall satisfaction and understanding of
   telemedicine as a supplement in traditional medical consultations
   increased as follows: 4.71 +/- 0.74 versus 4.86 +/- 0.93 versus 5.1 +/-
   1.5 and, respectively, 5.02 +/- 0.96 versus 5.25 +/- 0.81 versus 5.7 +/-
   0.6. In the 2015 evaluation, 93\% of students indicated that they would
   use telemedicine for chronically ill and elderly patients.
   Conclusion: The positive assessment of the module indicates the
   successful introduction of the topics of telemedicine and e-health to
   medical students at the University of Zurich. Throughout the course, the
   students gained confidence and basic skills.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Telehealth is a form of assistance support and continuing
   education for professionals who work in Primary Healthcare.
   Introduction: The implementation of the Brazilian Telehealth Program has
   extended the need for evaluation of its results to improve its use and
   benefits. Thus, it is necessary to systematize the theory, principals,
   and guidelines that guide the program organization, its activities, and
   resources. The objective of this study is to propose a theoretical model
   of functioning and organization for telehealth centers of the Brazilian
   Telehealth Program.
   Materials and Methods: A study that combined bibliographic, documental
   research and empiric data to systematize information, which are the
   basis functioning of the program, and verify the availability of
   telehealth centers in Brazil.
   Results: The results were the construction of a theoretical model that
   demonstrated the evaluability of the object and the definition of
   methodological paths to continue the evaluation research that respond
   with fragilities and potentialities.
   Discussion: In Brazil, there is public funding for telehealth activities
   offered by telehealth centers linked to the Ministry of Health. Its
   operation is guided by support for training and assistance activities,
   enabling qualification and strengthening of professionals to improve
   patient care and increase access. The transformation of reality is
   possible and favored by the articulation of teaching and service. More
   research is needed to evaluate these services offered. Theoretical
   guidance through modeling is fundamental to qualify the evaluation.
   Conclusion: The theoretical model is an important tool to qualify and
   optimize the evaluative research process.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Smartphones are ubiquitous, but it is unknown what
   physiological functions can be monitored at clinical quality. Pulmonary
   function is a standard measure of health status for cardiopulmonary
   patients. We have shown phone sensors can accurately measure walking
   patterns. Here we show that improved classification models can
   accurately predict pulmonary function, with sole inputs being motion
   sensors from carried phones.
   Subjects and Methods: Twenty-five cardiopulmonary patients performed
   6-minute walk tests in pulmonary rehabilitation at a regional hospital.
   They carried smartphones running custom software recording phone motion.
   Each patient's pulmonary function was measured by spirometry. A
   universal model, based on support vector machine, then computed the
   category of function with input from signal processing features and
   patient demographic features.
   Results: All but a few of every 10-second interval for every patient was
   correctly predicted. The trained model perfectly computed the GOLD
   (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) level 1/2/3,
   which is a standard classification of pulmonary function. Each level was
   determined to have a characteristic motion, which could be recognized
   from the sensor features. In addition, longitudinal changes were
   detected for 10 patients with multiple walk tests, except for cases with
   clinical instability.
   Conclusions: These results are encouraging toward clinical validation of
   passive monitors running continuously in the background, for patients in
   homes during daily activities. Initial testing indicates the same high
   accuracy as with active monitors, for patients in hospitals during walk
   tests. We expect patients can simply carry their phones during everyday
   living, while models support automatic prediction of pulmonary function
   for health monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Telemedicine care models for managing advanced chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may benefit from the addition of
   motion sensing, spirometry, and tablet-based symptom diary tracking.
   Methods: We conducted a feasibility study of telemedicine in the home
   setting using multiple activity sensor monitoring equipment. Deployment
   and monitoring were supported by home health nurses with technical
   advice from the equipment makers as needed. Data analytics for motion
   sensing was provided by the research sponsor, but was not used for care
   decisions. On study intake, a health risk assessment, Quality of Life
   (SF-36) survey, and the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire were
   administered to assess patients' self-perception of quality of life,
   activities of daily life function, and difficulty living with COPD.
   Results: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled and data were gathered for
   a minimum of 6 months and maximum of 9 months. The researchers
   demonstrated that augmentation of traditional telemedicine methods with
   motion sensing, spirometry, and symptom diaries appears feasible. The
   technical, process, logistics barriers, and solutions required for
   system deployment are described. The researchers demonstrated that
   augmentation of traditional telemedicine methods with motion sensing,

Abstract = {{Background: Appropriate and effective use of technology within practice
   is a key competency outlined in Australian dietetics training standards.
   An e-health skills component (lecture and workshop) was introduced to
   undergraduate students enrolled in an Australian nutrition and dietetics
   program.
   Methods: The lecture orientated students to key e-health terms and
   concepts relating to telehealth and m-health technologies, while the
   workshop provided an opportunity to apply knowledge. The workshop
   consisted of four stations with activities relating to (1) orientation
   to telehealth equipment; (2) comparison of dietetic consultation
   components completed in person versus remotely via video call; (3)
   quality assessment of mobile apps; and (4) exploration of advantages and
   disadvantages, and the ethical, security, and privacy issues relating to
   use of e-health technologies in dietetic practice. Student experience of
   the training was evaluated via questionnaire.
   Results: Forty-five students (62.2\% aged <= 19-24 years, 86.7\% female)
   completed the survey. Following the workshop, the level of understanding
   relating to each key e-health concept improved significantly (p<0.001).
   The aspects relating to the impact and need for initial training and
   ongoing professional education to support the use of e-health
   technologies within dietetic practice were rated a high level of
   importance by most students (78-80\%). The majority of students (93.3\%
   to 97.8\%) reported a positive experience at each of the four workshop
   stations, with informative the most common word selected to rate each
   station (37.8\% to 44.4\% of students across the four stations).
   Conclusion: The introduction of an e-health skills component resulted in
   an improved understanding of concepts for using these technologies.
   These findings provide preliminary support for integration of further
   e-health training within the dietetics program.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The literature on the use of mobile diagnostic units for the
   adult population is limited. This is a report for the first time in
   Colombia (Latin America) on the use of mobile diagnostic units for
   patients in rural areas and resolution of complex cases through
   telemedicine.
   Introduction: Telemedicine is an alternative because it takes advantage
   of advances in telecommunications and technology for the provision of
   health services to patients in rural areas of a country.
   Materials and Methods: A pilot program for mobile patient diagnosis was
   developed in three rural areas of central Colombia. The mobile unit was
   named Mobile dIagnostiC Unit (MICU). The unit includes a medical
   stretcher, dresser, washbasin, computer, videoconference equipment,
   satellite connectivity, and digital medical equipment:
   electrocardiogram, stethoscope, oximeter, and thermometer.
   Results: The number of patients attended during the 3 days of activity
   was 108, similar to 36 each day. None of the patients (100\%) was
   familiar with digital diagnostic tools and telemedicine. The entire
   population who attended (100\%) was satisfied with the care, health
   education, and diagnosis received.
   Discussion: Our case report shows that the use of MICUs with the support
   of telemedicine offers benefit to the rural population in the geographic
   zone chosen in Colombia.
   Conclusions: With greater coverage and access for patients to health

Abstract = {{Objectives:Pediatric subspecialty care, including multidisciplinary
   palliative care, tends to be located in urban academic centers or
   children's hospitals. Telehealth provides the opportunity to care for
   patients who would otherwise not be able to access services. We present
   cases wherein telehealth was used to provide counseling services to
   patients who would not have been able to receive this service.
   Methods:We discuss cases of telehealth use for patient and family
   counseling in the setting of palliative care and bereavement follow-up.
   Patients who live a great distance from the hospital with limited access
   to services were followed by a hospital-based pediatric palliative care
   team. Patients and families gave feedback after use of telehealth for
   counseling services.
   Results:Counseling through telehealth by our hospital-based palliative
   care social worker was successful for all parties involved: patient,
   family, and social worker.
   Conclusions:Telehealth helps relieve disparity in access to services and
   care, which is particularly problematic in pediatrics and mental health.
   For the patients in this case series, it was an effective modality to
   receive counseling services and meet needs that otherwise would not have
   been addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Most African American (AA) men own a smartphone, which positions them to
   be targeted for a variety of programs, services, and health
   interventions using mobile devices (mHealth). The goal of this study was
   to assess AA men's use of technology and the barriers and motivators to
   participating in mHealth research. A self-administered survey was
   completed by 311 men. Multinomial logistic regression examined
   associations between three age groups (18-29 years, 30-50 years, and 51+
   years), technology access, and motivators and barriers to participating
   in mHealth research. Sixty-five percent of men owned a smartphone and a
   laptop. Men aged 18 to 29 years were more likely willing to use a health
   app and smartwatch/wristband monitor than older men (p < .01). Men aged
   18 to 29 years were also more likely than older men to be motivated to
   participate for a free cell phone/upgraded data plan and contribution to
   the greater good (p < .05). Older men were more likely than younger ones
   to be motivated to become more educated about the topic (p < .05).
   Younger men were more likely than older ones to report lack of interest
   in the topic as a barrier to participating (p < .01), while older men
   were more likely than younger ones to cite lack of research targeted to
   minority communities as a barrier (p < .05). This study suggests that
   culturally tailored mHealth research using smartphones may be of
   interest to AA men interested in risk reduction and chronic disease
   self-management. Opportunities also exist to educate AA men about the
   topic at hand and why minority men are being targeted for the programs

Title = {{Agreement Between Home-Based Measurement of Stool Calprotectin and ELISA
   Results for Monitoring Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1742+}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: An increasing number of physicians use repeated
   measurements of stool calprotectin to monitor intestinal inflammation in
   patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). A lateral flow-based
   rapid test allows patients to measure their own stool calprotectin
   values at home. The test comes with a software application (IBDoc;
   Buhlmann Laboratories AG, Schonenbuch, Switzerland) that turns a
   smartphone camera into a results reader. We compared results from this
   method with those from the hospital-based reader (Quantum Blue; Buhlmann
   Laboratories AG) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis.
   METHODS: In a single-center comparison study, we asked 101 participants
   (10 years of age or older) in the Netherlands to perform the IBDoc
   measurement on stool samples collected at home, from June 2015 to
   October 2016. Participants then sent the residual extraction fluid and a
   fresh specimen from the same bowel movement to our pediatric and adult
   IBD center at the University Medical Center Groningen, where the level
   of calprotectin was measured by the Quantum Blue reader and ELISA
   analysis, respectively. The primary outcome was the agreement of results
   between IBDoc and the Quantum Blue and ELISA analyses, determined by
   Bland-Altman plot analysis.
   RESULTS: We received 152 IBDoc results, 138 samples of residual
   extraction fluid for Quantum Blue analysis, and 170 fresh stool samples
   for ELISA analysis. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 0.94 for
   results obtained by IBDoc vs Quantum Blue and 0.85 for results obtained
   by IBDoc vs ELISA. At the low range of calprotectin level (<500 mu g/g),
   91\% of IBDoc-Quantum Blue results were within the predefined limits of
   agreement (>= 100 mu g/g), and 71\% of IBDoc-ELISA results were in
   agreement. At the high range of calprotectin level (>= 500 mu g/g), 81\%
   of IBDoc-Quantum Blue results were within the predefined limits of
   agreement (+/- 200 mu g/g) and 64\% of IBDoc-ELISA results were in
   agreement.
   CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of fecal levels of calprotectin made with
   home-based lateral flow method were in agreement with measurements made
   by Quantum Blue and ELISA, as long as concentrations were <500 mg/g. For
   patients with concentrations of fecal calprotectin above this level,
   findings from IBDoc should be confirmed by another method.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of Review As the number of people with diabetic retinopathy (DR)
   in the USA is expected to increase threefold by 2050, the need to reduce
   health care costs associated with screening for this treatable disease
   is ever present. Crowdsourcing and automated retinal image analysis
   (ARIA) are two areas where new technology has been applied to reduce
   costs in screening for DR. This paper reviews the current literature
   surrounding these new technologies.
   Recent Findings Crowdsourcing has high sensitivity for normal vs
   abnormal images; however, when multiple categories for severity of DR
   are added, specificity is reduced. ARIAs have higher sensitivity and
   specificity, and some commercial ARIA programs are already in use. Deep
   learning enhanced ARIAs appear to offer even more improvement in ARIA
   grading accuracy.
   Summary The utilization of crowdsourcing and ARIAs may be a key to
   reducing the time and cost burden of processing images from DR
   screening.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of Review This article discusses recent applications in
   telemedicine to promote the goals of population health and population
   management for people suffering psychiatric disorders.
   Recent Findings The use of telemedicine to promote collaborative care,
   self-monitoring and chronic disease management, and population screening
   has demonstrated broad applicability and effectiveness. Collaborative
   care using videoconferencing to facilitate mental health specialty
   consults has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of depression,
   PTSD, and also ADHD in pediatric populations. Mobile health is currently
   being harnessed to monitor patient symptom trajectories with the goal of
   using machine learning algorithms to predict illness relapse. Patient
   portals serve as a bridge between patients and providers. They provide
   an electronically secure shared space for providers and patients to
   collaborate and optimize care.
   Summary To date, research has supported the effectiveness of
   telemedicine in promoting population health. Future endeavors should
   focus on developing the most effective clinical protocols for using
   these technologies to ensure long-term use and maximum effectiveness in
   reducing population burden of mental health.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Through a clinical simulation, this study aims to assess the effect
   of telematics support through Google Glass (GG) from an expert physician
   on performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performed by a
   group of nurses, as compared with a control group of nurses receiving no
   assistance.Methods This was a randomised study carried out at the
   Catholic University of Murcia (November 2014-February 2015). Nursing
   professionals from the Emergency Medical Services in Murcia (Spain) were
   asked to perform in a clinical simulation of cardiac arrest. Half of the
   nurses were randomly chosen to receive coaching from physicians through
   GG, while the other half did not receive any coaching (controls). The
   main outcome of the study expected was successful defibrillation, which
   restores sinus rhythm. Results Thirty-six nurses were enrolled in each
   study group. Statistically significant differences were found in the
   percentages of successful defibrillation (100\% GG vs 78\% control;
   p=0005) and CPR completion times: 213.91 s for GG and 250.31 s for
   control (average dlfference=36.39s (95\% Cl 12.03 to 60.75), p=0.004).
   Conclusions Telematics support by an expert through GG improves success
   rates and completion times while performing CPR in simulated clinical
   situations for nurses in simulated scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Our aim was to improve access to genetic services in an
   underserved region by developing a collaborative telegenetic service
   delivery model with a pediatrician, medical geneticist, and genetics
   counselor (GC).
   Methods: Protocols for the evaluation of common genetic indications were
   developed. Patients referred with indications suggestive of a syndromic
   etiology were scheduled to see the geneticist directly via telegenetics.
   Other patients were scheduled to see the pediatrician and GC in person
   before follow-up with the geneticist if indicated. Patients seen by the
   geneticist and/or pediatrician/GC were enumerated and the next available
   appointment was tracked. Patient satisfaction surveys were conducted.
   Results: Of the 265 patients evaluated during the study period, 116
   (44\%) were evaluated by a pediatrician and GC in person first, after
   which 82 (71\% of those evaluated) required further follow-up with the
   geneticist. The next available appointment with a pediatrician and GC
   never exceeded 6 weeks, while new appointments with a geneticist ranged
   from 3 to 9 months. All patients reported high satisfaction with this
   genetic service model.
   Conclusion: The pediatrician/GC clinic provides a model of collaborative
   care that is a medical home neighbor and exemplifies the integration of
   genetics into primary care. The telegenetics clinic offers a viable
   solution to providing competent and convenient access to a geneticist
   for patients in chronically underserved regions.}},

Abstract = {{Teledermoscopy is a promising modern technique to complement or to
   substitute dermatologic examination.
   In this pilot study, we compared the outcomes of teledermoscopic
   consultations with clinical examinations and histologic results.
   Conventional and dermatoscopic photos of single lesions were taken in 26
   patients using a mobile phone and an attached handyscope optical system.
   Five resident physicians performed a clinical examination including
   dermoscopy while the teledermatologic and teledermoscopic photos were
   assessed by an experienced dermatologist. Examination results were
   compared regarding diagnosis, differential diagnoses, recommended
   further management, as well as subjective and objective accuracy of
   diagnosis. In addition, 23\% of the lesions were excised and
   histologically examined.
   The most frequent diagnosis was ``nevus cell nevus{''}, followed by
   ``subungual hematoma{''} and ``basal cell carcinoma{''}. The concordance
   of diagnoses was 92.3\%; the concordance of recommended further
   management was 76.9\%. Of the 6 histologically proven diagnoses, 66.7\%
   were given the same diagnosis by teledermatoscopy and conventional
   clinical assessment. Concerning accuracy of diagnosis, teledermoscopy
   showed no disadvantage.
   Teledermatologic photos of single lesions combined with
   teledermatoscopic photos can be reliably and safely assessed. Especially
   when access to dermatologic examination is difficult, mobile
   teledermoscopy is a good and reliable alternative.}},

Title = {{A qualitative study of COPD-patients' experience of a telemedicine
   intervention}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{11-17}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Clinically stable patients with chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD) are often followed at regular intervals
   regardless of the needs. Our aim was to investigate the patient
   perspective on receiving tele-medicine with weekly submission of
   readings and regular video consultations (Net-COPD) as an alternative to
   visits in the respiratory outpatient clinic and investigating the role
   of telemedicine in management of severe COPD.
   Design: Descriptive design and the method is qualitative based on
   semistructured interviews.
   Methods: Fourteen intervention patients participated from the Danish
   randomized clinical trial Net-COPD project. The transcribed interviews
   were analysed using manifest and latent content analysis.
   Findings: Participants reported that Net-COPD brought enhanced wellbeing
   and a sense of security in knowing that nurses kept an eye on them and
   initiated appropriate interventions in case of changes in the patient's
   condition. This was experienced as a lifeline to the respiratory
   outpatient clinic, which could be contacted when needed. Through
   monitoring, moreover, patients developed increased awareness and better
   self-management of their disease. Patients also experienced more focused
   and less stressful meetings via video consultations, than in respiratory
   outpatient visits. Nevertheless it was important that it was the same
   health staff patient met in the video consultations.
   Conclusion: Participation in telemedicine increased the patient
   empowerment primarily by the sharing of data with a permanent staff of
   nurses. This knowledge was used to keep control of the disease in the
   form of extra readings and the systematic use of learned initiatives.
   This gave patients and relatives a sense of security.}},

Title = {{e-Health readiness assessment factors and measuring tools: A systematic
   review}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{56-64}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: The evolving, adoption and high failure nature of health
   information technology (HIT)/IS/T systems requires effective readiness
   assessment to avert increasing failures while increasing system
   benefits. However, literature on HIT readiness assessment is myriad and
   fragmented. This review bares the contours of the available literature
   concluding in a set of manageable and usable recommendations for
   policymakers, researchers, individuals and organizations intending to
   assess readiness for any HIT implementation.
   Objectives: Identify studies, analyze readiness factors and offer
   recommendations.
   Method: Published articles 1995-2016 were searched using Medline/PubMed,
   Cinahl, Web of Science, PsychInfo, ProQuest. Studies were included if
   they were assessing IS/T/mHealth readiness in the context of HIT.
   Articles not written in English were excluded. Themes that emerged in
   the process of the data synthesis were thematically analysed and
   interpreted.
   Results: Analyzed themes were found across 63 articles. In accordance
   with their prevalence of use, they included but not limited to
   ``Technological readiness{''}, 30 (46\%); ``Core/Need/Motivational
   readiness{''}, 23 (37\%); ``Acceptance and use readiness{''}, 19 (29\%);
   ``Organizational readiness{''}, 20 (21\%); ``IT skills/Training/Learning
   readiness{''} (18\%), ``Engagement readiness{''}, 16 (24\%) and
   ``Societal readiness{''} (14\%). Despite their prevalence in use, ``
   Technological readiness{''}, `` Motivational readiness{''} and ``
   Engagement readiness{''} all had myriad and unreliable measuring tools.
   Core readiness had relatively reliable measuring tools, which repeatedly
   been used in various readiness assessment studies
   Conclusion: Thus, there is the need for reliable measuring tools for
   even the most commonly used readiness assessment factors/constructs:
   Core readiness, Engagement and buy-ins readiness, Technological
   readiness and IT Skills readiness as this could serve as an immediate
   step in conducting effective/reliable e-Health readiness assessment,
   which could lead to reduced HIT implementation failures.}},

Title = {{Beyond Adoption: A New Framework for Theorizing and Evaluating
   Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and
   Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Background: Many promising technological innovations in health and
   social care are characterized by nonadoption or abandonment by
   individuals or by failed attempts to scale up locally, spread distantly,
   or sustain the innovation long term at the organization or system level.
   Objective: Our objective was to produce an evidence-based,
   theory-informed, and pragmatic framework to help predict and evaluate
   the success of a technology-supported health or social care program.
   Methods: The study had 2 parallel components: (1) secondary research
   (hermeneutic systematic review) to identify key domains, and (2)
   empirical case studies of technology implementation to explore, test,
   and refine these domains. We studied 6 technology-supported
   programs-video outpatient consultations, global positioning system
   tracking for cognitive impairment, pendant alarm services, remote
   biomarker monitoring for heart failure, care organizing software, and
   integrated case management via data sharing-using longitudinal
   ethnography and action research for up to 3 years across more than 20
   organizations. Data were collected at micro level (individual technology
   users), meso level (organizational processes and systems), and macro
   level (national policy and wider context). Analysis and synthesis was
   aided by sociotechnically informed theories of individual,
   organizational, and system change. The draft framework was shared with
   colleagues who were introducing or evaluating other technology-supported
   health or care programs and refined in response to feedback.
   Results: The literature review identified 28 previous technology
   implementation frameworks, of which 14 had taken a dynamic systems
   approach (including 2 integrative reviews of previous work). Our
   empirical dataset consisted of over 400 hours of ethnographic
   observation, 165 semistructured interviews, and 200 documents. The final
   nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS)
   framework included questions in 7 domains: the condition or illness, the
   technology, the value proposition, the adopter system (comprising
   professional staff, patient, and lay caregivers), the organization(s),
   the wider (institutional and societal) context, and the interaction and
   mutual adaptation between all these domains over time. Our empirical
   case studies raised a variety of challenges across all 7 domains, each
   classified as simple (straightforward, predictable, few components),
   complicated (multiple interacting components or issues), or complex
   (dynamic, unpredictable, not easily disaggregated into constituent
   components). Programs characterized by complicatedness proved difficult
   but not impossible to implement. Those characterized by complexity in
   multiple NASSS domains rarely, if ever, became mainstreamed. The
   framework showed promise when applied (both prospectively and
   retrospectively) to other programs.
   Conclusions: Subject to further empirical testing, NASSS could be
   applied across a range of technological innovations in health and social
   care. It has several potential uses: (1) to inform the design of a new
   technology; (2) to identify technological solutions that (perhaps
   despite policy or industry enthusiasm) have a limited chance of
   achieving large-scale, sustained adoption; (3) to plan the
   implementation, scale-up, or rollout of a technology program; and (4) to
   explain and learn from program failures.}},

Abstract = {{The synthetic generation/coding and transmission of olfactory
   information over a gas stream or an odor network is a new and unexplored
   field. Application areas vary from the entertainment or advertisement

   to investigate the generation-encoding of gaseous standards with odorous
   characteristics with a regulatable way, for scent transmission purposes.
   The calibration and the responses of a developed OE were examined using
   a portable quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS). Experiments were
   undertaken for a range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at different
   temperatures and flow rates. Individual compounds and mixtures were
   tested to investigate periodic and dynamic transmission characteristics
   within two different size tubular containers for distances up to 3 m.
   Olfactory information transmission is demonstrated using MS as the main
   molecular sensor for odor detection and monitoring and for the first

Abstract = {{ObjectivesUltrasound serves an important role in the prenatal diagnosis
   of fetal structural anomalies. Recently, there has been increased use of
   teleultrasound protocols. We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and
   accuracy of teleultrasound.
   MethodsWe conducted an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective
   cohort study determining the sensitivity and accuracy of teleultrasound.
   In addition, we evaluated the number of ultrasound examinations required
   to complete an anatomic survey. Only ultrasound examinations performed
   for anatomic surveys were included. Studies were excluded if performed
   before 16 completed weeks' gestation, if they had multiple gestations,
   or for reasons other than anatomy (eg, Doppler studies and fluid
   assessment). Prenatal diagnoses were compared with postnatal diagnoses
   obtained from a robust mandatory birth defects surveillance program that
   records all birth defects in the entire state, from deliveries before 20
   weeks' gestation through infants up to 2 years of age.
   ResultsA total of 2499 studies were evaluated; 2368 were included. The
   teleultrasound cohort had a congenital anomaly prevalence of 5.66\%. The
   sensitivity of teleultrasound was 57.46\%; the specificity was 98.21\%;
   and the accuracy was 95.9\%. Anatomic surveys were completed after 1
   visit in 82\% of patients, whereas 63\% and 61\% of the remaining
   patients required 2 and 3 visits, respectively.
   ConclusionsTeleultrasound for prenatal diagnosis has similar sensitivity
   and accuracy as the published literature for on-site ultrasound. Further
   studies are needed to compare the sensitivity and accuracy within the
   same population and further validate this potentially cost-saving
   modality.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of
   technology-based weight loss interventions for endometrial cancer (EC)
   survivors with obesity.
   Methods: EC survivors with obesity (n5196) from three medical centers
   completed assessments for knowledge of obesity as a risk for EC and
   interest in weight management. Forty-one women were randomized to a
   6-month intervention: telemedicine with Wi-Fi scales, text messaging
   (texting), or enhanced usual care (EUC). Changes in anthropometrics and
   psychosocial measures were analyzed.
   Results: One-third of survey participants lacked awareness that obesity
   increased the risk of EC, and 40\% misclassified their body mass. There
   were no significant differences in weight loss across interventions
   (mean524.4 kg, SD56.5 kg). Telemedicine showed improvements in physical
   health and cancerrelated body image (Ps50.04) compared to texting and in
   sexual functioning compared to EUC (P50.03). Total physical activity was
   increased in EUC compared with telemedicine (P50.01), and vigorous
   physical activity was increased in EUC compared with both interventions
   (P50.01-0.03); walking significantly increased in texting compared with
   telemedicine (P50.02).
   Conclusions: Technology-based lifestyle interventions in EC survivors
   with obesity were accessible and resulted in weight loss and improved
   quality of life. EUC also produced weight loss, demonstrating a
   potential for beginning weight management with information on specific
   diet and exercise goals.}},

Abstract = {{Telemedicine is a young science that integrates innovations of
   information-technology and telecommunications into medical science. A
   successful telemedicine procedure should guarantee reduced workload of
   the healthcare system with well secured and cost-effective processes.
   Our goal was to collect the development phases of telemedicine projects
   through existing telecardiology solutions. Subsequent to reviewing
   international publications we analyzed the past and present situation of
   blood pressure monitoring, remote diagnostics of electrocardiography,
   implantable cardioverter defibrillator monitoring and pocket ultrasound
   devices. In case of new solutions (a) several internationally accepted,
   confidently reproducible ``good practices{''} are needed for creating
   (b) guidelines and recommendations of international medical
   associations. They have to ensure (c) cost-effective work, with
   well-designed sustainability and (d) patient confidentiality. Improving
   (e) education for professionals and patients is essential. We recommend
   to telemedicine developers to use our standards in order to introduce
   their products more effectively into clinical practice. It is
   encouraging that current possibilities of telecardiology partly or fully
   meet the aforementioned criteria. Further development of the topic can
   contribute to financial sustainability of our healthcare and might be
   able to resolve limitations of human resources.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Physicians are increasingly using smartphones to take
   clinical photographs. This study evaluates a smartphone application for
   clinical photography that prioritizes and facilitates patient security.
   Methods: Ethics approval was obtained to trial a smartphone clinical
   photography application, PicSafe Medi. Calgary plastic surgeons and
   residents used the application to obtain informed consent and photograph
   patients. Surveys gauging the application's usability, consent process,
   and photograph storage/sharing were then sent to surgeons and patients.
   Results: Over a 6-month trial period, 15 plastic surgeons and residents
   used the application to photograph 86 patients. Over half of the
   patients (57\%) completed the survey. The majority of patients (96\%)
   were satisfied with the application's consent process, and all felt
   their photographs were secure. The majority (93\%) of surgeons/residents
   completed the survey. The application was felt to overcome issues with
   current photography practices: inadequate consent and storage of
   photographs (100\%), risk to patient confidentiality (92\%), and
   unsecure photograph sharing (93\%). Barriers to regular use of the
   application included need for cellphone service/Internet (54\%),
   sanitary concerns due to the need for patients to sign directly on the
   phone (46\%), inability to obtain proactive/retroactive consent (85\%),
   and difficulty viewing photographs (80\%). The majority of surgeons
   (85\%) believe a smartphone application would be suitable for clinical
   patient photography, but due to its limitations, only 23\% would use the
   trialed application. Conclusions: A smartphone clinical photography
   application addresses the patient confidentiality risks of current
   photography methods; however, limitations of the trialed application
   prevent its broad implementation.}},

Journal = {{RESPIROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1508-1517}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{It is increasingly recognized that the high prevalence of obstructive
   sleep apnoea (OSA), and its associated cardio-metabolic morbidities make
   OSA a burden for society. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP),
   the gold standard treatment, needs to be used for more than 4 h/night to
   be effective, but suffers from relatively poor adherence. Furthermore,
   CPAP is likely to be more effective if combined with lifestyle changes.
   Thus, the remote telemonitoring (TM) of OSA patients in terms of CPAP
   use, signalling of device problems, following disease progression,
   detection of acute events and monitoring of daily physical activity is
   an attractive option. In the present review, we aim to summarize the
   recent scientific data on remote TM of OSA patients, and whether it
   meets expectations. We also look at how patient education and follow-up
   via telemedicine is used to improve adherence and we discuss the
   influence of the profile of the healthcare provider. Then, we consider
   how TM might be extended to encompass the patient's cardio-metabolic
   health in general. Lastly, we explore how TM and the deluge of data it
   potentially generates could be combined with electronic health records
   in providing personalized care and multi-disease management to OSA
   patients.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Body area networks (BANs) are wireless networks around the human body.
   Ultra-wideband (UWB) is one of the most preferred candidates for the
   physical layer of BAN. However, the attenuation due to human body
   tissues and the movement of body parts with respect to each other causes
   severe attenuation and limits the range of UWB. Hence, new and novel
   methods are required to improve communications in UWB BAN. The paper
   proposes, hybrid amplify forward and decode forward relays for
   communication in body area networks. Scenarios in the presence of
   multiple relays for both body surface and body surface to external
   models have been taken into consideration. The performance has been
   tested using IEEE 802.15 task group 6 designated channel models
   developed from real-time measurements. The findings from the analytical
   as well as simulation-based study indicate that hybrid relaying provides
   a versatile performance, and improves the reliability of the
   communication link by decreasing the bit error rate. The performance has
   been further validated by the transmission of medical magnetic resonance
   images. The results indicate that hybrid relaying has the best
   performance, and it can undoubtedly improve the reliability of the body
   area networks.}},

Title = {{Advances in Remote Respiratory Assessments for People with Chronic
   Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Systematic Review}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background:Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading
   cause of mortality. Advances in remote technologies and telemedicine
   provide new ways to monitor respiratory function and improve chronic
   disease management. However, telemedicine does not always include remote
   respiratory assessments, and the current state of knowledge for people
   with COPD has not been evaluated.
   Objective:Systematically review the use of remote respiratory
   assessments in people with COPD, including the following questions: What
   devices have been used? Can acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (AECOPD) be predicted by using remote devices? Do
   remote respiratory assessments improve health-related outcomes?
   Materials and Methods:The review protocol was registered (PROSPERO
   2016:CRD42016049333). MEDLINE, EMBASE, and COMPENDEX databases were
   searched for studies that included remote respiratory assessments in
   people with COPD. A narrative synthesis was then conducted by two
   reviewers according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
   and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
   Results:Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Forced expiratory
   volume assessed daily by using a spirometer was the most common
   modality. Other measurements included resting respiratory rate,
   respiratory sounds, and end-tidal carbon dioxide level. Remote
   assessments had high user satisfaction. Benefits included early
   detection of AECOPD, improved health-related outcomes, and the ability
   to replace hospital care with a virtual ward.
   Conclusion:Remote respiratory assessments are feasible and when combined
   with sufficient organizational backup can improve health-related
   outcomes in some but not all cohorts. Future research should focus on
   the early detection, intervention, and rehabilitation for AECOPD in
   high-risk people who have limited access to best care and investigate
   continuous as well as intermittent monitoring.}},

Title = {{The Mental Workload Evaluation in Visualizing Telehealth Indicators on
   Three-Dimensional Interface}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: As Internet bandwidth has risen, resulting in an
   exponential increase in the amount of data, one of the challenges is to
   transform large amounts of unstructured health data into legible
   information through visualization techniques to facilitate the
   decision-making between the telehealth managers. Traditionally, data
   visualization has been two-dimensional (2D), but it is often difficult
   to visualize and interpret when making decisions with multidimensional
   data. Three-dimensional (3D) visualization techniques are emerging to
   address this issue. This study aims to investigate and demonstrate the
   hypothesis that the use of 3D techniques for information visualization
   is more effective than some 2D visualization techniques. Hypothesis
   validation was performed with a usability methodology analyzing of the
   time, efficiency, effectiveness, and mental workload required in the
   execution of a task with a developed prototype.
   Materials and Methods: A random sample of telehealth professionals was
   used. Data were collected through observation and usability
   questionnaires, including the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) mental workload
   protocol. Data analysis was based on quantitative and qualitative
   approaches.
   Results: The study showed that mental workload, despite the time of task
   execution and effectiveness of the prototype, with 3D technique was less
   than the 2D technique. The 3D technique required less mental effort than
   the 2D technique.
   Conclusions: The 3D environment supports the service manager to verify
   the telehealth quality of service toward the features provided by 3D
   environment, especially, its capability to identify trends, clusters of
   interest, and perform indicators comparison.}},

Title = {{Potential role of tele-rehabilitation to address barriers to
   implementation of physical therapy among West African stroke survivors:
   A cross-sectional survey}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{381}},
Pages = {{203-208}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: The greatest burden from stroke-related disability is borne
   by Low-and-Middle Income countries (LMICs) where access to
   rehabilitation after stroke is severely challenged. Tele-rehabilitation
   could be a viable avenue to address unmet rehabilitation needs in LMICs.
   Objectives: To assess the burden of post-stroke physical deficits, rates
   of utilization of physiotherapy services, and perceptions of
   tele-rehabilitation among recent Ghanaian stroke survivors.
   Methods: Using a consecutive sampling strategy, 100 stroke survivors
   attending an outpatient Neurology clinic in a Ghanaian tertiary medical
   center were enrolled into this cross-sectional study. After collecting
   basic demographic data, clinical history on stroke type, severity and
   level of disability, we administered the validated 20 item Functional
   Independence Measure questionnaire to evaluate functional status of
   study participants and an 8-item questionnaire to assess participants'
   attitudes towards telemedicine administered rehabilitation intervention.
   Results: Mean +/- SD age of study participants was 57.2 +/- 13.3 years
   of which 51.0\% were males with a mean duration of stroke of 1.3 +/- 2.2
   years. 53\% had Modified Rankin scores of >= 3, 57\% were fully
   independent and only 27\% reported utilizing any physiotherapy services.
   Barriers to access to physiotherapy included financial constraints due
   to cost of physiotherapy services and transportation as well as
   premature discharge from physiotherapy to avoid overburdening of
   available physiotherapy services. These factors led to the limited
   provision of rehabilitative therapy. Participants held positive views of
   the potential for tele-rehabilitation interventions (80-93\%). However,
   while 85\% owned mobile phones, only 35\% had smart phones.
   Conclusion: Despite, a high burden of residual disability, only about 1
   out of 4 stroke patients in this Ghanaian cohort was exposed to
   post-stroke physiotherapy services, largely due to relatively high costs
   and limited health system resources. These Ghanaian stroke patients
   viewed the potential role of Tele-rehabilitation as positive, but this
   promising intervention needs to be formally tested for feasibility,
   efficacy and cost-effectiveness.}},

Title = {{Correlation between pulmonary artery pressure and thoracic impedance:
   Insights from daily monitoring through an implanted device in chronic
   heart failure}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{245}},
Pages = {{196-200}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Thoracic impedance (TI) decrease and pulmonary artery
   pressure (PAP) elevation precede acute decompensation in congestive
   heart failure (HF). However, the relationship between TI and PAP has
   been studied only in the context of acute decompensation.
   Methods: This prospective, observational study enrolled subjects with
   reduced ejection fraction HF, previously implanted with an ICD capable
   of measuring TI. Patients underwent implantation of a sensor for direct
   measurement of PAP (CardioMEMs (TM)). Both TI and PAP were remotely
   monitored daily during follow up. Investigators were blinded to PAP
   values during the first three months, then PAP was used as a guide to
   therapy.
   Results: Ten patients were followed up for 405 +/- 141 days (3720
   patient-days). During hemodynamic guided therapy, diastolic PAP (dPAP)
   decreased from 27.8 +/- 10.2 mm Hg to 24.0 +/- 8.0 mm Hg (p < 0.001);
   nonsignificant variations of TI were observed. A significant negative
   correlation was found between the variations of TI and PAP vs. baseline
   (p < 0.001). Episodes of sustained increase of PAP preceded subsequent
   periods of TI decrease by 5.6 +/- 3.9 days, but the former were poor
   predictors of the latter (sensitivity 0.37).
   Conclusions: Our study confirms the strict correlation that exists
   between left ventricular filling pressures and lung water content,
   estimated by dPAP and TI, respectively. However, dPAP acute variation
   analysis showed a limited value in predicting subsequent episodes of TI
   decrease. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Assessment of a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) model for Telemonitoring
   patients with Chronic Heart Failure (CHF)}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this study is to assess the
   Business-to-Consumer (B2C) model for telemonitoring patients with
   Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) by analysing the value it creates, both for
   organizations or ventures that provide telemonitoring services based on
   it, and for society.
   Methods: The business model assessment was based on the following
   categories: caveats, venture type, six-factor alignment, strategic
   market assessment, financial viability, valuation analysis,
   sustainability, societal impact, and technology assessment. The venture
   valuation was performed for three jurisdictions (countries) -Singapore,
   the Netherlands and the United States - in order to show the
   opportunities in a small, medium-sized, and large country (i.e.
   population).
   Results: The business model assessment revealed that B2C telemonitoring
   is viable and profitable in the Innovating in Healthcare Framework.
   Analysis of the ecosystem revealed an average-to-excellent fit with the
   six factors. The structure and financing fit was average, public policy
   and technology alignment was good, while consumer alignment and
   accountability fit was deemed excellent. The financial prognosis
   revealed that the venture is viable and profitable in Singapore and the
   Netherlands but not in the United States due to relatively high salary
   inputs.
   Conclusions: The B2C model in telemonitoring CHF potentially creates
   value for patients, shareholders of the service provider, and society.
   However, the validity of the results could be improved, for instance by
   using a peer-reviewed framework, a systematic literature search,
   case-based cost/efficiency inputs, and varied scenario inputs.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Background : Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and disabling
   pathology that is characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms and
   affects millions of people worldwide. The disease significantly affects
   quality of life of those affected. Many works in literature discuss the
   effects of the disease. The most promising trends involve sensor
   devices, which are low cost, low power, unobtrusive, and accurate in the
   measurements, for monitoring and managing the pathology. Objectives:
   This review focuses on wearable devices for PD applications and
   identifies five main fields: early diagnosis, tremor, body motion
   analysis, motor fluctuations (ON-OFF phases), and home and long-term
   monitoring. The concept is to obtain an overview of the pathology at
   each stage of development, from the beginning of the disease to consider
   early symptoms, during disease progression with analysis of the most
   common disorders, and including management of the most complicated
   situations (i.e., motor fluctuations and long-term remote monitoring).
   Data sources: The research was conducted within three databases: IEEE
   Xplore (R), Science Direct (R), and PubMed Central (R), between January
   2006 and December 2016. Study eligibility criteria: Since 1,429 articles
   were found, accurate definition of the exclusion criteria and selection
   strategy allowed identification of the most relevant papers. Results:
   Finally, 136 papers were fully evaluated and included in this review,
   allowing a wide overview of wearable devices for the management of
   Parkinson's disease.}},

Abstract = {{Telemedicine, the use of audiovisual technology to provide health care
   from a remote location, is increasingly used in intensive care units
   (ICUs). However, studies evaluating the impact of ICU telemedicine show
   mixed results, with some studies demonstrating improved patient
   outcomes, while others show limited benefit or even harm. Little is
   known about the mechanisms that influence variation in ICU telemedicine
   effectiveness, leaving providers without guidance on how to best use
   this potentially transformative technology. The Contributors to
   Effective Critical Care Telemedicine (ConnECCT) study aims to fill this
   knowledge gap by identifying the clinical and organizational factors
   associated with variation in ICU telemedicine effectiveness, as well as
   exploring the clinical contexts and provider perceptions of ICU
   telemedicine use and its impact on patient outcomes, using a range of
   qualitative methods. In this report, we describe the study protocol,
   data collection methods, and planned future analyses of the ConnECCT
   study. Over the course of 1 year, the study team visited purposefully
   sampled health systems across the United States that have adopted
   telemedicine. Data collection methods included direct observations,
   interviews, focus groups, and artifact collection. Data were collected
   at the ICUs that provide in-person critical care as well as at the
   supporting telemedicine units. Iterative thematic content analysis will
   be used to identify and define key constructs related to telemedicine
   effectiveness and describe the relationship between them. Ultimately,
   the study results will provide a framework for more effective
   implementation of ICU telemedicine, leading to improved clinical
   outcomes for critically ill patients.}},

   management: A systematic review and network meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 4}},
Abstract = {{The effects of telemedicine strategies on the management of diabetes is
   not clear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of different
   telemedicine strategies on glycaemic control management of type 2
   diabetes patients. A search was performed in 6 databases from inception
   until September 2016 for randomized controlled studies that examined the
   use of telemedicine in adults with type 2 diabetes. Studies were
   independently extracted and classified according to the following
   telemedicine strategies: teleeducation, telemonitoring,
   telecase-management, telementoring and teleconsultation. Traditional and
   network meta-analysis were performed to estimate the relative treatment
   effects. A total of 107 studies involving 20,501 participants were
   included. Over a median of 6 months follow-up, telemedicine reduced
   haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by a mean of 0.43\% (95\% CI: -0.64\% to
   -0.21\%). Network meta-analysis showed that all telemedicine strategies
   were effective in reducing HbA1c significantly compared to usual care
   except for telecase-management and telementoring, with mean difference
   ranging from 0.37\% and 0.71\%. Ranking indicated that teleconsultation
   was the most effective telemedicine strategy, followed by
   telecase-management plus telemonitoring, and finally teleeducation plus
   telecase-management. The review indicates that most telemedicine
   strategies can be useful, either as an adjunct or to replace usual care,
   leading to clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Corneal and anterior segment diseases cause most of the urgent
   visits to eye care professionals. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy
   of detecting corneal diseases using external photographs from 2 portable
   cameras for telemedicine purposes.
   Methods: This is a prospective study of adults with a clinical diagnosis
   of corneal pathology including corneal abrasions, ulcers, scars, and
   pterygia. A cornea specialist provided the gold standard diagnosis by
   slit-lamp examination. Images of both eyes were obtained using iTouch 5S
   and Nidek VersaCam cameras in multiple gazes and interpreted by 3 cornea
   specialists for the presence of pathology. Accuracy to detect disease
   was compared with gold standard diagnosis, stratified by the camera and
   grader. Reliability was evaluated with weighted kappa statistics.
   Graders assessed image quality on a Likert scale from 1 (poor) to 9
   (optimal).
   Results: A total of 198 eyes (110 subjects) were photographed. By gold
   standard diagnosis, 59 eyes (30\%) had corneal scars, 34 (17\%) had
   ulcers, 13 (7\%) had abrasions, 10 (5\%) had pterygia, and 82 (41\%)
   were normal. Sensitivity to detect AS pathology ranged from 54\% to 71\%
   for the iTouch and 66\% to 75\% for the Nidek, across graders;
   specificity ranged from 82\% to 96\% for the iTouch and 91\% to 98\% for
   the Nidek. The intergrader reliability was moderate to strong (kappa
   ranges: 0.54-0.71 for the iTouch; 0.75-0.76 for the Nidek). Quality
   ratings were variable between graders.
   Conclusions: External photographs taken by standard, nonenhanced
   portable cameras and interpreted remotely by ophthalmologist graders
   yielded sensitivity values that are not yet suitable for telemedicine
   applications. Additional work is needed to improve the ability to detect
   AS pathology remotely.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Hawaii is a fast-aging, multi-ethnic state. At present, ethnic
   Japanese represent the largest segment of the elderly population (aged
   265 years). Studies in Western countries have identified an association
   between ethnicity and the use of homecare services. The present study
   sought to substantiate this association in relation to the use of a
   personal emergency response system service by older ethnic Japanese
   adults in Hawaii.
   Methods: Questionnaires were mailed to 585 elderly subscribers of a
   company providing personal emergency response system services in Elawaii
   in 2014. The questionnaire inquired about the subscriber's ethnicity,
   functional disability, number of medications taken and falls
   experienced. Additional information on the sex, age and service payer
   was obtained for each of the responding subscribers from the corporate
   database. The x2-test and t-test were carried out to assess the
   associations between factors.
   Results: A total of 244 questionnaires were analyzed (41.7\% response
   rate; mean age of respondents 86.1.8 years). Compared with non-Japanese
   older adults, ethnic Japanese older adults had a higher propensity to
   use the personal emergency response system services, were older, used
   fewer prescribed medications and were more likely to have these services
   paid for by family members or to pay themselves.
   Conclusions: Japanese culture might influence the use of personal
   emergency response system services. Ethnic Japanese older adults might
   want to receive homecare services focusing on preventing minor accidents
   from becoming medical crises because of their high level of concern for
   health, their independence and the availability of family support.
   Healthcare planners should consider such factors in the provision of
   care in Elawaii.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, rural areas in many countries are limited by a lack of
   access to health care due to the inherent challenges associated with
   recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals. Telemedicine,
   which uses communication technology to deliver medical services over
   distance, is an economical and potentially effective way to address this
   problem. In this research, we develop a new telepresence application
   using an Augmented Reality (AR) system. We explore the use of the
   Microsoft HoloLens to facilitate and enhance remote medical training.
   Intrinsic advantages of AR systems enable remote learners to perform
   complex medical procedures such as Point of Care Ultrasound (PoCUS)
   without visual interference. This research uses the HoloLens to capture
   the first-person view of a simulated rural emergency room (ER) through
   mixed reality capture (MRC) and serves as a novel telemedicine platform
   with remote pointing capabilities. The mentor's hand gestures are
   captured using a Leap Motion and virtually displayed in the AR space of
   the HoloLens. To explore the feasibility of the developed platform,
   twelve novice medical trainees were guided by a mentor through a
   simulated ultrasound exploration in a trauma scenario, as part of a
   pilot user study. The study explores the utility of the system from the
   trainees, mentor, and objective observers' perspectives and compares the
   findings to that of a more traditional multi-camera telemedicine
   solution. The results obtained provide valuable insight and guidance for
   the development of an AR-supported telemedicine platform.}},

Abstract = {{The remotely supervised tDCS (RS-tDCS) protocol enables participation
   from home through guided and monitored self-administration of tDCS
   treatment while maintaining clinical standards. The current consensus
   regarding the efficacy of tDCS is that multiple treatment sessions are
   needed to observe targeted behavioral reductions in symptom burden.
   However, the requirement for patients to travel to clinic daily for
   stimulation sessions presents a major obstacle for potential
   participants, due to work or family obligations or limited ability to
   travel. This study presents a protocol that directly overcomes these
   obstacles by eliminating the need to travel to clinic for daily
   sessions.
   This is an updated protocol for remotely supervised self-administration
   of tDCS for daily treatment sessions paired with a program of
   computer-based cognitive training for use in clinical trials.
   Participants only need to attend clinic twice, for a baseline and
   study-end visit. At baseline, participants are trained and provided with
   a study stimulation device, and a small laptop computer. Participants
   then complete the remainder of their stimulation sessions at home while
   they are monitored via videoconferencing software.
   Participants complete computerized cognitive remediation during
   stimulation sessions, which may serve a therapeutic role or as a
   ``placeholder{''} for other computer-based activity. Computers are
   enabled for real-time monitoring and remote control by study staff.
   Outcome measures that assess feasibility and tolerance are administered
   remotely with the aid of visual analogue scales that are presented
   onscreen. Following completion of all RS-tDCS sessions, participants
   return to clinic for a study end visit in which all study equipment is
   returned.
   Results support the safety, feasibility, and scalability of the RS-tDCS
   protocol for use in clinical trials. Across 46 patients, 748 RS-tDCS
   sessions have been completed. This protocol serves as a model for use in
   future clinical trials involving tDCS.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Mobile health technologies (mHealth) may improve
   post-operative care but it is unknown if patients are willing to use
   this technology.
   Methods: We surveyed 800 NY State residents to determine their
   willingness to engage in mHealth after surgery and compared
   socioeconomic factors that may affect willingness to engage.
   Results: A majority of respondents reported willingness to wear a
   tracker on their wrist (80.6\%), fill out a survey (74.3\%), send
   pictures of their wound to their surgeon (66.3\%), and share updates
   with friends/family (59.1\%). Older age was associated with lower
   likelihood of having a smartphone, but not associated with willingness
   to engage with other features. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with
   lower likelihood of wearing a tracker while Black race was associated
   with lower willingness to send pictures.
   Conclusions: Overall, potential users of mHealth are interested and
   willing to use mHealth. Older respondents are as willing as younger
   respondents to engage with mHealth. Individuals with Hispanic ethnicity
   and Black race may be less willing to engage and therefore may require
   education regarding benefits of this technology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Purpose: In order to engage medical students and residents from public
   health centers to utilize the telemedicine features of surgery on their
   own smartphones and tablets as an educational tool, an innovative
   streaming system was developed with the purpose of streaming live
   footage from open surgeries to smartphones and tablets, allowing the
   visualization of the surgical field from the surgeon's perspective. The
   current study aims to describe the results of an evaluation on level 1
   of Kirkpatrick's Model for Evaluation of the streaming system usage
   during gynecological surgeries, based on the perception of medical
   students and gynecology residents. Methods: Consisted of a live video
   streaming (from the surgeon's point of view) of gynecological surgeries
   for smartphones and tablets, one for each volunteer. The volunteers were
   able to connect to the local wireless network, created by the streaming
   system, through an access password and watch the video transmission on a
   web browser on their smartphones. Then, they answered a Likert-type
   questionnaire containing 14 items about the educational applicability of
   the streaming system, as well as comparing it to watching an in loco
   procedure. This study is formally approved by the local ethics
   commission (Certificate No. 53175915.7.0000.5171/2016). Results:
   Twenty-one volunteers participated, totalizing 294 items answered, in
   which 94.2\% were in agreement with the items affirmative, 4.1\% were
   neutral, and only 1.7\% answers corresponded to negative impressions.
   Cronbach's alpha was .82, which represents a good reliability level.
   Spearman's coefficients were highly significant in 4 comparisons and
   moderately significant in the other 20 comparisons. Conclusions: This
   study presents a local streaming video system of live surgeries to
   smartphones and tablets and shows its educational utility, low cost, and
   simple usage, which offers convenience and satisfactory image
   resolution, thus being potentially applicable in surgical teaching.}},

Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: The benefits of vaccination have been comprehensively
   proven; however, disparities in coverage persist because of poor health
   system management, limited resources, and parental knowledge and
   attitudes. Evidence suggests that health interventions that engage local
   parties in communication strategies improve vaccination uptake. As
   mobile technology is widely used to improve health communication, mobile
   health (mHealth) interventions might be used to increase coverage.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of
   the available literature on the use of mHealth to improve vaccination in
   low-and middle-income countries with large numbers of unvaccinated
   children.
   Methods: In February 2017, MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and
   Retrieval System Online), Scopus, and Web of Science, as well as three
   health organization websites-Communication Initiative Network,
   TechNet-21, and PATH-were searched to identify mHealth intervention
   studies on vaccination uptake in 21 countries.
   Results: Ten peer-reviewed studies and 11 studies from white or gray
   literature were included. Nine took place in India, three in Pakistan,
   two each in Malawi and Nigeria, and one each in Bangladesh, Zambia,
   Zimbabwe, and Kenya. Ten peer-reviewed studies and 7 white or gray
   studies demonstrated improved vaccination uptake after interventions,
   including appointment reminders, mobile phone apps, and prerecorded
   messages.
   Conclusions: Although the potential for mHealth interventions to improve
   vaccination coverage seems clear, the evidence for such interventions is
   not. The dearth of studies in countries facing the greatest barriers to
   immunization impedes the prospects for evidence-based policy and
   practice in these settings.}},

Abstract = {{E-health has experienced a dynamic development across the European Union
   in the recent years and enjoys support from the European Commission that
   seeks to achieve interoperability of national healthcare systems in
   order to facilitate free movement. Differences that can be observed
   between the member states in legal regulations, cultural approaches and
   technological solutions may hinder this process. This study compares the
   legal standing of e-health in Denmark, Poland, Spain and the UK, along
   with key legal acts and their implications. The academic literature
   review along with an analysis of materials found through the desk study
   research (reports, legal acts, press articles, governmental web pages
   and so on) was performed in order to identify aspects relevant to
   e-health interoperability. The approach to legal regulation of e-health
   substantially differs by country. So do the procedures that they have
   developed regarding the requirement for patient's consent for the
   processing of their data, their rights to access to the medical data, to
   change the data, data confidentiality and types of electronic health
   records. The principles governing the assignment of responsibility for
   data protection are also different. These legal and technological
   differences must be reconciled if interoperability of European national
   e-health systems is to be achieved. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \&

Title = {{iPhone Sensors in Tracking Outcome Variables of the 30-Second Chair
   Stand Test and Stair Climb Test to Evaluate Disability: Cross-Sectional
   Pilot Study}},

Abstract = {{Background: Performance tests are important to characterize patient
   disabilities and functional changes. The Osteoarthritis Research Society
   International and others recommend the 30-second Chair Stand Test and
   Stair Climb Test, among others, as core tests that capture two distinct
   types of disability during activities of daily living. However, these
   two tests are limited by current protocols of testing in clinics. There
   is a need for an alternative that allows remote testing of functional
   capabilities during these tests in the osteoarthritis patient
   population.
   Objective: Objectives are to (1) develop an app for testing the
   functionality of an iPhone's accelerometer and gravity sensor and (2)
   conduct a pilot study objectively evaluating the criterion validity and
   test-retest reliability of outcome variables obtained from these sensors
   during the 30-second Chair Stand Test and Stair Climb Test.
   Methods: An iOS app was developed with data collection capabilities from
   the built-in iPhone accelerometer and gravity sensor tools and linked to
   Google Firebase. A total of 24 subjects performed the 30-second Chair
   Stand Test with an iPhone accelerometer collecting data and an external
   rater manually counting sit-to-stand repetitions. A total of 21 subjects
   performed the Stair Climb Test with an iPhone gravity sensor turned on
   and an external rater timing the duration of the test on a stopwatch.
   App data from Firebase were converted into graphical data and exported
   into MATLAB for data filtering. Multiple iterations of a data processing
   algorithm were used to increase robustness and accuracy.
   MATLAB-generated outcome variables were compared to the manually
   determined outcome variables of each test. Pearson's correlation
   coefficients (PCCs), Bland-Altman plots, intraclass correlation
   coefficients (ICCs), standard errors of measurement, and repeatability
   coefficients were generated to evaluate criterion validity, agreement,
   and test-retest reliability of iPhone sensor data against gold-standard
   manual measurements.
   Results: App accelerometer data during the 30-second Chair Stand Test
   (PCC=.890) and gravity sensor data during the Stair Climb Test
   (PCC=.865) were highly correlated to gold-standard manual measurements.
   Greater than 95\% of values on Bland-Altman plots comparing the manual
   data to the app data fell within the 95\% limits of agreement. Strong
   intraclass correlation was found for trials of the 30-second Chair Stand
   Test (ICC=.968) and Stair Climb Test (ICC=.902). Standard errors of
   measurement for both tests were found to be within acceptable thresholds
   for MATLAB. Repeatability coefficients for the 30-second Chair Stand
   Test and Stair Climb Test were 0.629 and 1.20, respectively.
   Conclusions: App-based performance testing of the 30-second Chair Stand
   Test and Stair Climb Test is valid and reliable, suggesting its
   applicability to future, larger-scale studies in the osteoarthritis
   patient population.}},

Title = {{Fitbit Charge HR Wireless Heart Rate Monitor: Validation Study Conducted
   Under Free-Living Conditions}},
Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many modern smart watches and activity trackers feature an
   optical sensor that estimates the wearer's heart rate. Recent studies
   have evaluated the performance of these consumer devices in the
   laboratory.
   Objective: The objective of our study was to examine the accuracy and
   sensitivity of a common wrist-worn tracker device in measuring heart
   rates and detecting 1-min bouts of moderate to vigorous physical
   activity (MVPA) under free-living conditions.
   Methods: Ten healthy volunteers were recruited from a large university
   in Singapore to participate in a limited field test, followed by a month
   of continuous data collection. During the field test, each participant
   would wear one Fitbit Charge HR activity tracker and one Polar H6 heart
   rate monitor. Fitbit measures were accessed at 1-min intervals, while
   Polar readings were available for 10-s intervals. We derived intraclass
   correlation coefficients (ICCs) for individual participants comparing
   heart rate estimates. We applied Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention heart rate zone cut-offs to ascertain the sensitivity and
   specificity of Fitbit in identifying 1-min epochs falling into MVPA
   heart rate zone.
   Results: We collected paired heart rate data for 2509 1-min epochs in 10
   individuals under free-living conditions of 3 to 6 hours. The overall
   ICC comparing 1-min Fitbit measures with average 10-s Polar H6 measures
   for the same epoch was .83 (95\% CI.63-.91). On average, the Fitbit
   tracker underestimated heart rate measures by -5.96 bpm (standard error,
   SE=0.18). At the low intensity heart rate zone, the underestimate was
   smaller at -4.22 bpm (SE=0.15). This underestimate grew to -16.2 bpm
   (SE=0.74) in the MVPA heart rate zone. Fitbit devices detected 52.9\%
   (192/363) of MVPA heart rate zone epochs correctly. Positive and
   negative predictive values were 86.1\% (192/223) and 92.52\%
   (2115/2286), respectively. During subsequent 1 month of continuous data
   collection (270 person-days), only 3.9\% of 1-min epochs could be
   categorized as MVPA according to heart rate zones. This measure was
   affected by decreasing wear time and adherence over the period of
   follow-up.
   Conclusions: Under free-living conditions, Fitbit trackers are affected
   by significant systematic errors. Improvements in tracker accuracy and
   sensitivity when measuring MVPA are required before they can be
   considered for use in the context of exercise prescription to promote
   better health.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Rural areas in Ontario have fewer psychiatrists, making
   access to specialist mental health care challenging. Our objective was
   to characterise psychiatrists delivering and patients receiving
   telepsychiatry in Ontario and to determine the number of patients who
   accessed a psychiatrist via telepsychiatry following discharge from
   psychiatric hospitalisation.
   Method: We conducted a serial panel study to evaluate the
   characteristics of psychiatrists providing telepsychiatry from April
   2007 to March 2013. In addition, we conducted a cross-sectional study
   for fiscal year 2012-2013 to examine telepsychiatry patient
   characteristics and create an in-need patient cohort of individuals with
   a recent psychiatric hospitalisation that assessed if they had follow-up
   with a psychiatrist in person or through telepsychiatry within 1 year of
   discharge.
   Results: In fiscal year 2012-2013, a total of 3801 people had 5635
   telepsychiatry visits, and 7\% (n = 138) of Ontario psychiatrists
   provided telepsychiatry. Of the 48,381 people identified as in need of
   psychiatric care, 60\% saw a local psychiatrist, 39\% saw no
   psychiatrist, and less than 1\% saw a psychiatrist through
   telepsychiatry only or telepsychiatry in addition to local psychiatry
   within a year. Three northern regions had more than 50\% of in-need
   patients fail to access psychiatry within 1 year.
   Conclusions: Currently, relatively few patients and psychiatrists use
   telepsychiatry. In addition, patients scarcely access telepsychiatry for
   posthospitalisation follow-up. This study, which serves as a preliminary
   baseline for telepsychiatry in Ontario, demonstrates that telepsychiatry
   has not evolved systematically to address need and highlights the
   importance of system-level planning when implementing telepsychiatry to
   optimise access to care.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of sepsis is increasing, and the condition is now the
   leading cause of death in general intensive care units. Our review
   failed to identify studies of the causes of cardiac arrest among
   infected patients, even though non-cardiac causes represent 15\% of
   out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and though one-third of events have
   positive blood cultures. Sudden cardiac arrest is the result of local
   damage to the heart and of the impact of systemic and pulmonary
   conditions on cardiac performance, and its danger is underestimated.
   Necropsy findings in sudden death often identify myocarditis as an
   unexpected cause. The role of hypoxaemia, severe pulmonary
   thromboembolism with subsequent pulseless cardiac activity, alterations
   of electrolytes and hydrogen concentrations, distort fluid distribution
   with reduced pre-load, direct myocyte damage and adverse cardiac effects
   related to antibiotic use need to be defined. Many cardiac arrests might
   be preventable. Because cardiopulmonary resuscitation is challenging and
   usually unsuccessful in patients with sepsis, research is needed to help
   predict which patients are at risk. Only half of pneumonia patients with
   cardiac arrest in the ward receive prior ECG monitoring. Telemedicine
   and non-invasive monitoring in the ward, avoidance of antibiotics
   associated with prolonged QT syndrome, and adequate haemodynamic
   resuscitation might be important in preventing in-hospital arrests among
   patients with infections. (C) 2016 European Society of Clinical

Title = {{Community-based distribution of misoprostol for early abortion:
   evaluation of a program along the Thailand Burma border}},
Journal = {{CONTRACEPTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{96}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although abortion is legal in Thailand for a number of
   indications, women from Burma residing in Thailand are rarely able to
   access safe services. We evaluated the outcomes of a community-based
   distribution program that provides migrant, refugee, and cross-border
   women from Burma with evidence-based information about and access to
   misoprostol for early pregnancy termination.
   Methods: After determination of eligibility based on self-report and
   counseling, trained Network members instructed women to vaginally
   administer two 800-mcg doses of misoprostol 24 h apart and a third dose
   one week later, if needed. We systematically reviewed data from
   monitoring logbooks recorded over a three-year period to examine
   pregnancy outcomes. We also conducted in-depth open-ended interviews
   with the three leaders of the two Networks to understand better their
   perceptions and experiences as providers and counselors. We analyzed
   logbook data using descriptive statistics and interviews for content and
   themes using both deductive and inductive techniques.
   Results: From January 2012 through December 2014, 918 women received
   early abortion care using misoprostol through the community based
   distribution program. Of these, 885 women (96.4\%) were not pregnant at
   follow-up, 29 were pregnant at follow-up (3.2\%), and four women were
   lost to follow-up (0.4\%). Our interviews revealed that providers are
   motivated to participate due to concerns surrounding unsafe abortion in
   the community and frame their work as a public health intervention.
   Conclusions: The documented outcomes from this initiative may be
   valuable for those working to reduce harm from unsafe abortion in other
   legally restricted, low-resource, and/or conflict-affected settings. (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose of Review Diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of
   blindness among working-age US adults even though timely screening and
   treatment prevent 90\% of blindness. We summarize current knowledge and
   perspectives to better understand why diabetic eye screening rates
   remain low and future directions towards preventing blindness from
   diabetes.
   Recent Findings Significant advancements in the past 10 years include
   primary care and patient-oriented interventions as well as the use of
   teleophthalmology. In England, diabetic eye disease is no longer the
   leading cause of certifiable blindness following the implementation of a
   national teleophthalmology program for diabetic retinopathy.
   Summary Multiple workflow and systems-level barriers affect providers.
   Patient barriers include a limited understanding of screening and lack
   of access to care. Interventions have been developed, but new barriers
   exist towards sustaining their impact. More research is needed to
   identify and implement the best practices to increase diabetic eye
   screening rates long-term.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of Review The purpose of this study is to review the evidence
   that lower risk groups who could safely be screened less frequently for
   sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (DR) than annually.
   Recent Findings Data have demonstrated that people with no DR in either
   eye are at a low risk of progression to sight-threatening DR over a
   2-year period (event rate 4.8 per 1000 person years), irrespective of
   whether the screening method is one-field non-mydriatic or two-field
   mydriatic digital photography. Low risk has been defined as no
   retinopathy on two consecutive screening episodes or no retinopathy on
   one screening episode combined with risk factor data.
   Summary The risk of an extension to 2 years is less than 5 per 1000
   person years in a population with a national screening programme, and
   the general standard of diabetes care is relatively good, whether low
   risk is defined as no retinopathy on two consecutive screening episodes
   or no retinopathy on one screening episode combined with other risk
   factor data. The definition used in different populations is likely to
   depend on the availability of data.}},

Abstract = {{Caregivers of Alzheimer's patients find respite in online communities
   for solutions and emotional support. This study aims to understand the
   characteristics of information caregivers of Alzheimer's patients are
   searching for and the kind of support they receive through
   Internet-based peer support communities. Using a Web crawler written in
   Python Web programming language, we retrieved publicly available 2,500
   random posts and their respective solutions from April 2012 to October
   2016 on the solutions category of the Caregiver's Forum on
   ALZConnected.org. A content analysis was conducted on these randomly
   selected posts and 4,219 responses to those posts based on a
   classification system were derived from initial analyses of 750 posts
   and related responses. The results showed most posts (26\%) related to
   queries about Alzheimer's symptoms, and the highest percentage of
   responses (45.56\%) pertained to caregiver well-being. The LIWC analyses
   generated an average tone rating of 27.27 for the posts, implying a
   negative tone and 65.17 for their responses, implying a slightly
   positive tone. The ALZConnected.org Web site has the potential of being
   an emotionally supportive tool for caregivers; however, a more
   user-friendly interface is required to accommodate the needs of most
   caregivers and their technological skills. Solutions offered on the peer
   support groups are often subjective opinions of other caregivers and
   should not be considered professional or comprehensive; further research
   on educating caregivers using online forums is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. We must study alternatives to structure an effective
   diabetic retinopathy screening program for Brazilian public health
   system.
   Objectives. Evaluate the diagnostic performance of retinal digital
   photography for diabetic retinopathy screening in primary care, accuracy
   of the family physician in diabetic retinopathy identification compared
   to the ophthalmologist, and the need for dilation.
   Methodology. In a primary care service were performed retinal
   photographs with non-mydriatic Retinal Camera in 219 type 2 diabetic
   patients with and without medication mydriasis. We evaluated the
   performance of the diagnostic of the photos graded by three family
   physicians with training compared to two ophthalmologists (gold
   standard), and explore related factors with the need for mydriasis
   pharmacologically.
   Results. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy and proliferative
   diabetic retinopathy was 19.2\% and 1.5\%, respectively. The sensitivity
   of family physicians to evaluate diabetic retinopathy averaged 82.9\%
   (66.7-94.8\%); specificity, 92\% (90.2-93.3\%); the accuracy, 90.3\%
   (88.2-93\%) and positive predictive value, 71.2\% (68-75.5\%). The
   agreement calculated using the kappa adjusted coefficient was from 0.74
   to 0.8 for retinopathy and 0.88 to 0.92 for macular edema. Without drug
   mydriasis the photos were unreadable by 14.8\%, when using mydriatic
   collyrium this number decreased to 8.7\% (McNemar test, P < 0.005).
   Patients with more than 65 years old has more readability after drug
   mydriasis (McNemar test, P = 0.011).
   Conclusion. Trained family physician reached a good performance for
   evaluation of retinography for diabetic retinopathy. There was
   improvement in readability with pupil dilation in older patients.}},

Title = {{Managing transient ischaemic attacks in Australia: a qualitative study}},
Journal = {{FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{606-611}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background. Stroke risk after transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is
   highest in the first few days. It is greatly reduced by commencing
   commonly used medications. Current Australian guidelines recommend that
   all TIAs be managed urgently by secondary-care specialists (mandatory
   for high-risk TIAs). The majority of TIAs present to general practice
   which creates a dilemma when specialist care is not readily accessible.
   There is a lack of evidence relating to the determinants of general
   practitioners' (GPs) actions in this situation.
   Objective. To explore GP management of TIA presentations.
   Methods. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews of a
   maximum variation sample of senior and trainee GPs from New South Wales,
   Australia. Data collection and thematic analysis were concurrent and
   iterative, employing constant comparison, co-coding, participant
   transcript review, reflexivity and continued until thematic saturation
   was achieved.
   Results. Management of TIA was heterogeneous and depended upon the GP's
   engagement with the individual case. The level of engagement was
   predicated on the GP's predisposition toward managing transient
   neurological presentations generally, the clinical phenotype of the
   presentation and logistical or health system factors. Management was
   categorised as triage, guided collaboration, consultative collaboration
   and independent management. Collaboration with secondary care increased
   the GP's capability to diagnose and manage future TIAs.
   Conclusion. Heterogeneity of TIA management equates with variation from
   guideline recommendations. However, Australian guidelines may not be
   practicable due to variability in access to secondary-care specialists.
   Future models of care should consider systems approaches such as
   telemedicine to promote collaboration and assist GPs to comply with
   guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the feasibility and reliability of commonly used clinical
   dementia assessments when administered via direct-to-home telemedicine
   videoconferencing. To date, few studies assessed the suitability of
   these measures when used in this setting.
   Sixty-six participants (33 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
   their 33 caregivers) consented to assessment with a battery of tests in
   both the clinic setting and via telemedicine. We administered cognitive,
   behavior, and mood assessments to persons with mild, moderate, and
   severe AD both in the clinic setting and via direct-to-home telemedicine
   videoconferencing; test-retest reliability was assessed. We also
   explored how three caregiver measures performed when administered via
   telemedicine. Assessments were administered 2 weeks apart. Participant
   feedback about their experience was solicited.
   Twenty-eight dyads completed the assessments. Reliability was found to
   be good to excellent in all measures when used with direct-to-home
   telemedicine. For the most part, participants and clinicians found
   telemedicine to be a feasible option for assessing cognitive function
   and caregiver coping.
   Findings indicate that these measures can be used to assess persons with
   AD, as well as their caregivers, across the telemedicine platform,
   directly to their homes. Use of this technology can expand access to
   care to the millions across the United States with AD and their
   caregivers.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) require
   regular follow-up to manage their care, which requires significant
   amount of time and out-of-pocket costs. Telemedicine in the form of
   video virtual visits could serve as an alternative to in-office visits.
   The aim of this project was to understand if telemedicine can provide
   high value care (defined as quality/cost) to outpatients with IBD.
   Methods: Patients who participated in the IBD telemedicine clinic in the
   second half of 2015 were included. Patient-reported survey data before
   and after the virtual visit were collected. A retrospective review was
   performed on the study cohort for quality outcome measures a year before
   and after starting the telemedicine clinic. Outcomes were analyzed using
   simple descriptive statistics. Differences in quality outcomes were
   compared using odds ratios.
   Results: Forty-eight patients were included in the analysis. Most
   patients travel more than 25 miles each way, take half a day off, and on
   average incur an additional out-of-pocket cost of \$ 62 for an in-office
   visit. Most patients (98\%) agreed that there was enough time spent with
   their physician, 91\% agreed that they felt like the physician
   understood their disease state, and 78\% reported that they clearly
   understood the follow-up plan after the visit. Analysis of quality
   outcome measures did not show any drop in the overall quality of care,
   after initiating the telemedicine program.
   Conclusions: Telemedicine offers a low cost and convenient alternative
   for patients with IBD without compromising quality of care.}},

Abstract = {{With advances in technology, dynamic spectrum access is need of
   healthcare system. Heterogeneous networks increase spectrum efficiency,
   capacity, and network coverage. Uses of ZigBee, Bluetooth, and TV white
   space (TVWS) combination meet the increasing user demands on the mobile
   health system. TVWS is a promising wireless technology that is fast,
   less expensive, and wide ranged. It has the capability to provide
   connectivity to the remote and poorly connected areas, where it can
   efficiently serve telemedicine and healthcare services. This paper
   proposes a practical multi-tier mobile healthcare system (MHS) based on
   ZigBee, Bluetooth, and TVWS for connectionless areas to improve the
   healthcare system. The MHS is based on heterogeneous wireless sensor
   networks and allows communication in a distributed way, which is
   independent of time limitations and location boundaries. Heterogeneous
   technology has a great impact in the medical field as telemedicine
   progressively dependent on wirelessly connected technologies. In order
   to keep update the patient and doctor, these technologies imperatively
   involved transmitting any type of data like image, video, and text. The
   tier-1 devices use ZigBee and Bluetooth band, tier-2 devices use
   Bluetooth and TVWS, and tier-3 devices use TVWS and cellular network. In
   Tier-1 communication, master reduces unnecessary bridges and assigns
   them a reserve bridge task. In the event when bridge may cause network
   disconnecting due to mobility the reserve bridge is activated to avoid
   inter-piconet partitioning. Simulation results indicate the proposed
   system reduces control overhead, energy consumption, and blocking
   connections.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of Telemedicine or virtual care is expected to explode in
   coming years as many researchers predict in the coming years, lesser
   need for face-to-face interaction with doctors and more demand for
   access to patient records regardless of time and location. Therefore,
   Telemedicine will become commonplace relying on new modes of patient
   interactions of which cloud computing will have a vital role.
   Telemedicine based cloud computing services need to be evaluated on
   Quality of Services (QoS) concerns, especially on availability as a
   non-available Telemedicine service may lead to human life critical
   condition. To this end, a continuous evaluation of relevant QoS
   properties is highly desirable, and leads to building their reputation.
   Many cloud reputation evaluation models exist, most of which are based
   on subjective grading of QoS properties, or are qualitative in nature.
   Such models are highly prone to subjective biases. Hence, there is a
   need of an objective reputation model of Telemedicine services, which
   can estimate service levels over time without human biases. This paper
   presents analysis for such a quantitative reputation model. Results
   reflect on the evolution of reputation over time. It is significant for
   tentative service subscribers as it guides them for selection of a
   Telemedicine based cloud service provider.}},

Abstract = {{The current enhancement and technical development in radio communication
   have enabled the efficient, low power, intelligent, and wearable
   microsensor. These microsensors are tactically embedded in or located
   outside the human body in a fixed position, which is called Body Area
   Network (WBAN). Therefore, the key objective of this research work is to
   discover the current gaps in providing an improved service of WBAN. The
   paper presents a Fog-based Healthcare Architecture for Wearable Body
   Area Network (FHA). The fog based architecture is used for real-time
   patient monitoring and analysis of patients' health condition
   irrespective of location and time by using an integrated low-power and
   low-cost WBAN and fog computing. In order to diagnose and monitor the
   patient's health conditions, mobile wearable sensors are used to gather
   the patients' real-time data via ZigBee links and forward to the
   Tele-Lab Server (TLS). Where a Laboratory Information Database (LIDB)
   module resides that buffer and analyzes the data. The LIDB sends the
   whole information of all registered patients to the cloud server as a
   backup. When TLS frequently sends data to the fog server, it creates
   congestion, the proposed technique avoids the congestion on fog server.
   When FHA predicts the critical result of any patient, it immediately
   forwards the data to the fog server for emergency alert and updates the
   cloud server. From the simulation results, it is observed that the
   proposed FHA efficiently handle the current issues and increasing
   throughput, decreasing packet loss, and delay.}},

Title = {{Views of Community Managers on Knowledge Co-creation in Online
   Communities for People With Disabilities: Qualitative Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: The use of online communities to promote end user
   involvement and co-creation in the product and service innovation
   process is well documented in the marketing and management literature.
   Whereas online communities are widely used for health care service
   provision and peer-to-peer support, only little is known about how they
   could be integrated into the health care innovation process.
   Objective: The overall objective of this qualitative study was to
   explore community managers' views on and experiences with knowledge
   co-creation in online communities for people with disabilities.
   Methods: A descriptive qualitative research design was used. Data were
   collected through semi-structured interviews with nine community
   managers. To complement the interview data, additional information was
   retrieved from the communities in the form of structural information
   (number of registered users, number and names of topic areas covered by
   the forum) and administrative information (terms and conditions and
   privacy statements, forum rules). Data were analyzed using thematic
   analysis.
   Results: Our results highlight two main aspects: peer-to-peer knowledge
   co-creation and types of collaboration with external actors. Although
   community managers strongly encouraged peer-to-peer knowledge
   co-creation, our findings indicated that these activities were not
   common practice in the communities under investigation. In fact, much of
   what related to co-creation, prototyping, and product development was
   still perceived to be directed by professionals and experts. Community
   managers described the role of their respective communities as informing
   this process rather than a driving force. The role of community members
   as advisors to researchers, health care professionals, and businesses
   was discussed in the context of types of collaboration with external
   actors. According to the community managers, most of the external
   inquiries related to research projects of students or health care
   professionals in training, who often joined a community for the sole
   purpose of recruiting participants for their research. Despite this
   unilateral form of knowledge co-creation, community managers
   acknowledged the mere interest of these user groups as beneficial, as
   long as their interest was not purely financially motivated. Being able
   to contribute to advancing research, improving products, and informing
   the planning and design of health care services were described as some
   of the key motivations to engage with external stakeholders.
   Conclusions: This paper draws attention to the currently
   under-investigated role of online communities as platforms for
   collaboration and co-creation between patients, health care
   professionals, researchers, and businesses. It describes community
   managers' views on and experiences with knowledge co-creation and
   provides recommendations on how these activities can be leveraged to
   foster knowledge co-creation in health care. Engaging in knowledge
   co-creation with online health communities may ultimately help to inform
   the planning and design of products, services, and research activities
   that better meet the actual needs of those living with a disability.}},

Title = {{Characterizing Active Ingredients of eHealth Interventions Targeting
   Persons With Poorly Controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Using the
   Behavior Change Techniques Taxonomy: Scoping Review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: The behavior change technique taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1; Michie
   and colleagues, 2013) is a comprehensive tool to characterize active
   ingredients of interventions and includes 93 labels that are
   hierarchically clustered into 16 hierarchical clusters.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the active ingredients
   in electronic health (eHealth) interventions targeting patients with
   poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and relevant outcomes.
   Methods: We conducted a scoping review using the BCTTv1. Randomized
   controlled trials (RCTs), studies with or pre-post-test designs, and
   quasi-experimental studies examining efficacy and effectiveness of
   eHealth interventions for disease management or the promotion of
   relevant health behaviors were identified by searching PubMed, Web of
   Science, and PsycINFO. Reviewers independently screened titles and
   abstracts for eligibility using predetermined eligibility criteria. Data
   were extracted following a data extraction sheet. The BCTTv1 was used to
   characterize active ingredients of the interventions reported in the
   included studies.
   Results: Of the 1404 unique records screened, 32 studies fulfilled the
   inclusion criteria and reported results on the efficacy and or or
   effectiveness of interventions. Of the included 32 studies, 18 (56\%)
   were Web-based interventions delivered via personal digital assistant
   (PDA), tablet, computer, and/or mobile phones; 7 (22\%) were telehealth
   interventions delivered via landline; 6 (19\%) made use of text
   messaging (short service message, SMS); and 1 employed videoconferencing
   (3\%). Of the 16 hierarchical clusters of the BCTTv1, 11 were identified
   in interventions included in this review. Of the 93 individual behavior
   change techniques (BCTs), 31 were identified as active ingredients of
   the interventions. The most common BCTs identified were instruction on
   how to perform behavior, adding objects to the environment, information
   about health consequences, self-monitoring of the outcomes and/or and
   prefers to be explicit to avoid ambiguity. Response: Checked and avoided
   of a certain behavior Author: Please note that the journal discourages
   the use of parenthesis to denote either and/or and prefers to be
   explicit to avoid ambiguity. Response: Checked and avoided ``and/or{''}
   and prefers to be explicit to avoid ambiguity. Response: Checked and
   avoided, and feedback on outcomes of behavior.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that the majority of BCTs employed in
   interventions targeting persons with T2DM revolve around the promotion
   of self-regulatory behavior to manage the disease or to assist patients
   in performing health behaviors necessary to prevent further
   complications of the disease. Detailed reporting of the BCTs included in
   interventions targeting this population may facilitate the replication
   and further investigation of such interventions.}},

Title = {{What is eHealth (6)? Development of a Conceptual Model for eHealth:
   Qualitative Study with Key Informants}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Despite rapid growth in eHealth research, there remains a
   lack of consistency in defining and using terms related to eHealth. More
   widely cited definitions provide broad understanding of eHealth but lack
   sufficient conceptual clarity to operationalize eHealth and enable its
   implementation in health care practice, research, education, and policy.
   Definitions that are more detailed are often context or discipline
   specific, limiting ease of translation of these definitions across the
   breadth of eHealth perspectives and situations. A conceptual model of
   eHealth that adequately captures its complexity and potential overlaps
   is required. This model must also be sufficiently detailed to enable
   eHealth operationalization and hypothesis testing.
   Objective: This study aimed to develop a conceptual practice-based model
   of eHealth to support health professionals in applying eHealth to their
   particular professional or discipline contexts.
   Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with key informants
   (N=25) from organizations involved in health care delivery, research,
   education, practice, governance, and policy to explore their
   perspectives on and experiences with eHealth. We used purposeful
   sampling for maximum diversity. Interviews were coded and thematically
   analyzed for emergent domains.
   Results: Thematic analyses revealed 3 prominent but overlapping domains
   of eHealth: (1) health in our hands (using eHealth technologies to
   monitor, track, and inform health), (2) interacting for health (using
   digital technologies to enable health communication among practitioners
   and between health professionals and clients or patients), and (3) data
   enabling health (collecting, managing, and using health data). These
   domains formed a model of eHealth that addresses the need for clear
   definitions and a taxonomy of eHealth while acknowledging the fluidity
   of this area and the strengths of initiatives that span multiple eHealth
   domains.
   Conclusions: This model extends current understanding of eHealth by
   providing clearly defined domains of eHealth while highlighting the
   benefits of using digital technologies in ways that cross several
   domains. It provides the depth of perspectives and examples of eHealth
   use that are lacking in previous research. On the basis of this model,
   we suggest that eHealth initiatives that are most impactful would
   include elements from all 3 domains.}},

Title = {{Web-Based Tools for Text-Based Patient-Provider Communication in Chronic
   Conditions: Scoping Review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients with chronic conditions require ongoing care which
   not only necessitates support from health care providers outside
   appointments but also self-management. Web-based tools for text-based
   patient-provider communication, such as secure messaging, allow for
   sharing of contextual information and personal narrative in a simple
   accessible medium, empowering patients and enabling their providers to
   address emerging care needs.
   Objective: The objectives of this study were to (1) conduct a systematic
   search of the published literature and the Internet for Web-based tools
   for text-based communication between patients and providers; (2) map
   tool characteristics, their intended use, contexts in which they were
   used, and by whom; (3) describe the nature of their evaluation; and (4)
   understand the terminology used to describe the tools.
   Methods: We conducted a scoping review using the MEDLINE (Medical
   Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) and EMBASE (Excerpta
   Medica Database) databases. We summarized information on the
   characteristics of the tools (structure, functions, and communication
   paradigm), intended use, context and users, evaluation (study design and
   outcomes), and terminology. We performed a parallel search of the
   Internet to compare with tools identified in the published literature.
   Results: We identified 54 papers describing 47 unique tools from 13
   countries studied in the context of 68 chronic health conditions. The
   majority of tools (77\%, 36/47) had functions in addition to
   communication (eg, viewable care plan, symptom diary, or tracker). Eight
   tools (17\%, 8/47) were described as allowing patients to communicate
   with the team or multiple health care providers. Most of the tools were
   intended to support communication regarding symptom reporting (49\%,
   23/47), and lifestyle or behavior modification (36\%, 17/47). The type
   of health care providers who used tools to communicate with patients
   were predominantly allied health professionals of various disciplines
   (30\%, 14/47), nurses (23\%, 11/47), and physicians (19\%, 9/47), among
   others. Over half (52\%, 25/48) of the tools were evaluated in
   randomized controlled trials, and 23 tools (48\%, 23/48) were evaluated
   in nonrandomized studies. Terminology of tools varied by intervention
   type and functionality and did not consistently reflect a theme of
   communication. The majority of tools found in the Internet search were
   patient portals from 6 developers; none were found among published
   articles.
   Conclusions: Web-based tools for text-based patient-provider
   communication were identified from a wide variety of clinical contexts
   and with varied functionality. Tools were most prevalent in contexts
   where intended use was self-management. Few tools for team-based
   communication were found, but this may become increasingly important as
   chronic disease care becomes more interdisciplinary.}},

   characterize measurement components, and (3) assess psychometrics.
   Methods: Concepts from existing models and published studies of
   technology use and adoption were identified and used to inform a search
   strategy. Search terms were broadly categorized as platforms (eg,
   email), measurement (eg, survey), function/information use (eg,

   fluency with technology, computer literacy, and trust in and acceptance
   of technology. The review was limited to instruments that reported at
   least one psychometric property. Excluded were investigator-developed
   measures, disease-specific assessments delivered via technology or
   telephone (eg, a cancer-coping measure delivered via computer survey),
   and measures focused primarily on clinician use (eg, the electronic
   health record).
   Results: The search strategy yielded 47,320 articles. Following
   elimination of duplicates and non-English language publications
   (n=14,550) and books (n=27), another 31,647 articles were excluded
   through review of titles. Following a review of the abstracts of the
   remaining 1096 articles, 68 were retained for full-text review. Of
   these, 16 described an instrument and six used an instrument; one
   instrument was drawn from the GEM database, resulting in 23 articles for
   inclusion. None included a complete psychometric evaluation. The most
   frequently assessed property was internal consistency (21/23, 91\%).
   Testing for aspects of validity ranged from 48\% (11/23) to 78\%
   (18/23). Approximately half (13/23, 57\%) reported how to score the
   instrument. Only six (26\%) assessed the readability of the instrument
   for end users, although all the measures rely on self-report.
   Conclusions: Although most measures identified in this review were
   published after the year 2000, rapidly changing technology makes
   instrument development challenging. Platform-agnostic measures need to
   be developed that focus on concepts important for use of any type of
   eHealth innovation. At present, there are important gaps in the
   availability of psychometrically sound measures to evaluate eHealth
   technologies.}},

   overtriage of trauma patients}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Background: Helicopter transport of injured patients is controversial
   and costly. This study aims to show that a complex trauma algorithm
   leads to significant aeromedical overtriage at substantial cost. Our
   secondary outcomes were to compare adjusted mortality and outcomes
   between air and ground transport and determine predictors of overtriage.
   Materials and methods: A 6-y retrospective analysis was conducted of all
   trauma activations at a Level I center. Patients were dichotomized by
   transportation method as well as trauma activation criteria. Overtriage
   was defined as those who were discharged from the emergency department,
   medically admitted without injuries, or admitted to observation status
   only. Overtriage and associated charges were calculated for each patient
   cohort, and multivariate regression models were created to derive
   adjusted mortality rates and predictors of overtriage.
   Results: A total of 4218 patients were treated with 28\% arriving by
   helicopter. Overtriage increased significantly from 51\% to 77\% with
   lower tier activation criteria (P < 0.001). Median charges for
   air-evacuated patients was (sic)10,478 (versus \$ 1008 ground).
   Eliminating overtriage of air patients would result in a cost savings of
   \$ 1,316,036 annually. Adjusted mortality between air and ground
   transport was not significantly different (8.5\% versus 10.9\%, P =
   0.548). Predictors of overtriage included decreasing age, Injury
   Severity Score, Head Abbreviated Injury Score, nonoperative treatment,
   and lower tier activation criteria.
   Conclusions: Significant overtriage (52\%) and unnecessary air
   evacuation of minimally injured patients occurs at great financial cost.
   Revision of trauma activation protocols may result in more judicious air
   transport use and significant reductions in health care costs. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Planning a research strategy and formulating the right research
   questions at various stages of developing a telehealth intervention are
   essential for producing scientific evidence. The aim of research at each
   stage should correspond to the maturity of the intervention and will
   require a variety of study designs. Although there are several published
   evaluation frameworks for telemedicine or telehealth as a subset of
   broader eHealth domain, there is currently no simple model to guide
   research planning. In this paper we propose a five-stage model as a
   framework for planning a comprehensive telehealth research program for a
   new intervention or service system. The stages are: (1) Concept
   development, (2) Service design, (3) Pre-implementation, (4)
   Implementation, (5) Post-implementation, and at each stage a number of
   studies are considered. Robust evaluation is important for the
   widespread acceptance and implementation of telehealth. We hope this
   framework enables researchers, service administrators and clinicians to
   conceptualise, undertake and appraise telehealth research from the point
   of view of being able to assess how applicable and valid the research is
   for their particular circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{Healthcare systems require a paradigm shift in the way healthcare
   services are delivered to counteract demographic changes in patient
   populations, expanding technological developments and the increasing
   complexity of healthcare. Participatory design (PD) is a methodology
   that promotes the participation of users in the design process of
   potential telehealth applications. A PD project can be divided into four
   phases including: the identification and analysis of participant needs;
   the generation of ideas and development of prototypes; testing and
   further development of prototypes; and evaluation. PD is an iterative
   process where each phase is planned by reflecting on the results from
   the previous phase with respect to the participants' contribution. Key
   activities of a PD project include: fieldwork; literature reviewing; and
   development and testing. All activities must be applied with a
   participatory mindset that will ensure genuine participation throughout
   the project. Challenges associated with the use of PD include: the time
   required to properly engage with participants; language and culture
   barriers amongst participants; the selection of participants to ensure
   good representation of the user group; and empowerment. PD is an
   important process, which is complemented by other evaluation strategies
   that assess organisational requirements, clinical safety, and clinical
   and cost effectiveness. PD is a methodology which encourages genuine
   involvement, where participants have an opportunity to identify
   practical problems and to design and test technology. The process
   engages participants in storytelling, future planning and design. PD is
   a multifaceted assessment tool that helps explore more accurately
   clinical requirements and patient perspectives in telehealth.}},

Abstract = {{When establishing telehealth services, clinicians need to be confident
   that the examinations, assessments and clinical decisions that they make
   while using technology are equivalent to conventional best practice.
   Method-comparison studies are ideally suited to answering these
   questions, however there is a lack of consistency in the telehealth
   literature in the study methodologies and data analysis techniques used.
   Methodologies should closely match clinical practice to maximise
   external validity and data analysis techniques should match the data
   types generated in order to be clinically meaningful. In this article we
   discuss the design, analysis and interpretation of method-comparison
   studies in the context of telehealth research.}},

Abstract = {{Regionalization of pediatric cardiac surgical care varies between and
   within states. In most geographic regions, at least some neonates with
   critical heart disease are transferred from their birth hospital to a
   different hospital for surgery. The impact of neonatal transfer for
   surgery, particularly over a considerable distance (> 10 miles), has
   been largely unexplored. We sought to examine the impact of transferring
   neonates for cardiac surgery. We queried the New York State Cardiac
   Surgery database (2005-2014) from a single institution to identify
   neonates born within the cardiac surgery center and those transferred
   for surgery. Outcomes were compared between groups, with subgroup
   analysis of neonates with single ventricle anatomy. 113 surgical
   neonates were born at the cardiac surgery center, and 268 were
   transferred to the cardiac surgery center. Median transfer distance was
   91 (IQR 73, 94) miles. Age at operation and the need for preoperative
   ventilation were significantly lower in neonates born at the cardiac
   surgery center. In addition, single ventricle anatomy was more prevalent
   among those born at the cardiac surgery center (48.7 vs. 31.3\%; p =
   0.001). However, postoperative outcomes were the same-30-day survival
   was similar across groups (birth: 89\% vs. transfer: 90\%; p = 0.7), and
   for those with single ventricle palliation (birth: 81\% vs. transfer:
   81\%; p = 0.9). Within our regionalized network, we found no difference
   in 30-day survival between neonates either born or transferred to a
   cardiac surgery center, which supports the use of a regionalized network
   of hospitals to the care of children with congenital heart disease.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical telementoring (ST) was introduced in the sixties, promoting
   videoconferencing to enhance surgical education across large distances.
   Widespread use of ST in the surgical community is lacking. Despite
   numerous surveys assessing ST, there remains a lack of high-level
   scientific evidence demonstrating its impact on mentorship and surgical
   education. Despite this, there is an ongoing paradigm shift involving
   remote presence technologies and their application to skill development
   and technique dissemination in the international surgical community.
   Factors facilitating this include improved access to ST technology,
   including ease of use and data transmission, and affordability. Several
   international research initiatives have commenced to strengthen the
   scientific foundation documenting the impact of ST in surgical education
   and performance.
   International experts on ST were invited to the SAGES Project Six Summit
   in August 2015. Two experts in surgical education prepared relevant
   questions for discussion and organized the meeting (JP and HH). The
   questions were open-ended, and the discussion continued until no new
   item appeared. The transcripts of interviews were recorded by a
   secretary from SAGES.
   In this paper, we present a summary of the work performed by the SAGES
   Project 6 Education Working Group. We summarize the existing evidence
   regarding education in ST, identify and detail conceptual educational
   frameworks that may be used during ST, and present a structured
   framework for an educational curriculum in ST.
   The educational impact and optimal curricular organization of ST
   programs are largely unexplored. We outline the critical components of a
   structured ST curriculum, including prerequisites, teaching modalities,
   and key curricular components. We also detail research strategies
   critical to its continued evolution as an educational tool, including
   randomized controlled trials, establishment of a quality registry,
   qualitative research, learning analytics, and development of a
   standardized taxonomy.}},

Title = {{Legal Mapping Analysis of State Telehealth Reimbursement Policies}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{805-814}},

Abstract = {{Background: There exists rapid growth and inconsistency in the
   telehealth policy environment, which makes it difficult to
   quantitatively evaluate the impact of telehealth reimbursement and other
   policies without the availability of a legal mapping database.
   Introduction: We describe the creation of a legal mapping database of
   state-level policies related to telehealth reimbursement of healthcare
   services. Trends and characteristics of these policies are presented.
   Materials and Methods: Information provided by the Center for Connected
   Health Policy was used to identify statewide laws and regulations
   regarding telehealth reimbursement. Other information was retrieved by
   using: (1) LexisNexis database, (2) Westlaw database, and (3) retrieval
   from legislative Web sites, historical documents, and contacting state
   officials. We examined policies for live video, store-andforward, and
   remote patient monitoring (RPM).
   Results: In the United States, there are 24 states with policies
   regarding reimbursement for live video transmission. Fourteen states
   have store-and-forward policies, and six states have RPM-related
   policies. Mississippi is the only state that requires reimbursement for
   all three types of telehealth transmission modes. Most states (47
   states) have Medicaid policies regarding live video transmission,
   followed by 37 states for store-andforward and 20 states for RPM. Only
   13 states require that live video will be reimbursed ``consistent with''
   or at the ``same rate'' as in-person services in their Medicaid program.
   Discussion: There are no widely accepted telehealth reimbursement
   policies across states. They contain diverse restrictions and
   requirements that present complexities in policy evaluation and in
   determining policy effectiveness across states.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Stroke often leads to disability, and poststroke survivors
   often have limited accessibility to medical facilities.
   Introduction: For such patients, mobile videoconferencing technology
   offers an opportunity to perform follow-up assessment and appropriate
   management of cognitive impairment. We aimed to determine the validity
   of the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-K) when
   administered using a smartphone.
   Materials and Methods: Thirty patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic
   stroke were included in this study (20 males, 10 females; mean age, 69.8
   +/- 12.9 years). Both face-to-face and remote assessments of cognitive
   function through MMSE-K were performed for each patient at an interval
   of at least 3 days. Additionally, an in-person collaborator evaluated
   the MMSE-K score during the remote assessment. A smartphone and a tablet
   were used by the patient and the examiner, respectively, and remote
   connection was mediated using a dedicated videoconferencing application.
   The MMSE-K scores obtained through face-to-face, remote, and in-person
   assessments were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the
   Spearman correlation analysis.
   Results: There was good agreement between face-to-face and remote
   assessments, as well as between remote assessment and in-person
   collaborator's evaluation regarding total MMSE-K score and subscores for
   each MMSE-K domain (orientation, memory, attention/calculation,
   language, and visuospatial function).
   Discussion: Remote assessment can be a useful clinical evaluation
   method, and this study confirmed the validity. Conclusions: The
   smartphone represents a promising tool for the assessment of cognitive
   function in clinical practice, but further research into the intra- and
   inter-rater reliability of observations is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Development of mobile health (m-health) in China carries
   tremendous potential, especially for glaucoma, one of the major chronic
   ophthalmic diseases afflicting millions of people. However, little
   research has been undertaken to investigate the willingness of glaucoma
   patients to use m-health and the factors influencing their decisions.
   Subjects and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. A
   self-administered or face-to-face interview survey was performed on
   1,487 patients with glaucoma at the outpatient glaucoma service,
   Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yatsen University. Questionnaires
   captured patients' demographic data, WeChat access, and willingness to
   receive m-health. The data were analyzed by single factor chi-square
   test. Multiple logistic regression revealed the motivators and barriers
   to accept m-health adoption.
   Results: One thousand ninety-seven valid questionnaires were obtained.
   Seven hundred twenty-five respondents (66.1\%) were willing to
   participate in m-health programs. 65.4\% were younger than 60 years old.
   40.9\% had travel time from home to hospital of > 3 h. 63.6\% had more
   than four followup visits for glaucoma. 86.5\% experienced trouble
   events during clinic visits. The overall We Chat usage rate was 61.7\%.
   Age, travel time, number of visits, trouble events in clinic, and We
   Chat access in patients with glaucoma were related to the willingness to
   use m-health (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Most patients with glaucoma were willing to participate in
   m-health programs, which are essential to increasing and improving
   access to care.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patient care involves time sensitive decisions. Matching a
   patient's presenting condition with possible diagnoses requires proper
   assessment and diagnostic tests. Timely access to necessary information
   leads to improved patient care, better outcomes, and decreased costs.
   Introduction: This study evaluated objective outcomes of the
   implementation of a novel Resident Handbook Application (RHAP) for smart
   phones.
   Methods: The RHAP included tools necessary to make proper assessments
   and to order appropriate tests. The RHAPs effectiveness was accessed
   using the Military Health System Military Mart database. This database
   includes patient specific aggregate data, including diagnosis, patient
   demographics, itemized cost, hospital days, and disposition status.
   Multivariable analysis was used to compare before and after RHAP
   implementation, controlling for patient demographics and diagnosis.
   Internal medicine admission data were used as a control group.
   Results: There was a statistically significant decrease in laboratory
   costs and a strong trend toward statistically significant decreases in
   the cost of radiology performed after implementation of RHAP (p value of
   < 0.02 and < 0.07, respectively). There was also a decrease in hospital
   days (3.663.30 days), in total cost per admission (\$ 18,866-\$ 16,305),
   and in cost per hospital day per patient (\$ 5,140-\$ 4,936). During the
   same time period a Control group had no change or increases in these
   areas.
   Conclusions: The use of the RHAP resulted in decreases in costs in a
   variety of areas and a decrease in hospital bed days without any
   apparent negative effect upon patient outcomes or disposition status.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder in pregnancy where a
   patients' blood pressure and warning signs of worsening disease need to
   be closely monitored during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
   Introduction: No studies have examined remote patient monitoring using
   mobile health (m-health) technologies in obstetrical care for women with
   preeclampsia during the postpartum period. Remote monitoring and
   m-health technologies can expand healthcare coverage to the patient's
   home. This may be especially beneficial to patients with chronic
   conditions who live far from a healthcare facility.
   Materials and Methods: The study was designed to identify and examine
   the potential factors that influenced use of m-health technology and
   adherence to monitoring symptoms related to preeclampsia in postpartum
   women. A sample of 50 women enrolled into the study. Two participants
   were excluded, leaving a total sample size of 48 women. Users were given
   m-health devices to monitor blood pressure, weight, pulse, and oxygen
   saturation over a 2-week period. Nonusers did not receive equipment. The
   nurse call center monitored device readings and contacted participants
   as needed. Both groups completed a baseline and follow-up survey.
   Results: Women who elected to use the m-health technology on average had
   lower levels of perceived technology barriers, higher facilitating
   condition scores, and higher levels of perceived benefits of the
   technology compared with nonusers. Additionally, among users, there was
   no statistical difference between full and partial users at follow-up
   related to perceived ease of use, perceived satisfaction, or perceived
   benefits.
   Discussion: This study provided a basis for restructuring the management
   of care for postpartum women with hypertensive disorders through the use
   of m-health technology. Conclusion: Mobile health technology may be
   beneficial during pregnancy and the postpartum period for women with
   preeclampsia to closely manage and monitor their blood pressure and
   warning signs of worsening disease.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The significant gap between children and adolescents
   presenting for emergency mental healthcare and the shortage of child and
   adolescent psychiatrists constitutes a major barrier to timely access
   for psychiatric assessment for rural and remote areas. Unlike remote
   areas, urban emergency departments have in-house psychiatric
   consultation. Telepsychiatry may be a solution to ensure the same
   service for remote areas. However, there is a paucity of studies on the
   use of telepsychiatry for child and adolescent emergency consults. Thus,
   the aim of our study was to (1) assess patient satisfaction with
   telepsychiatry and (2) compare clinical characteristics and outcome of
   telepsychiatry with face-toface emergency child and adolescent
   assessments.
   Methods: This is a prospective study of telepsychiatry emergency
   assessments of children and adolescents referred by emergency
   physicians. The comparison group was age-and gender-matched patients
   seen for face-to-face urgent assessments. Data were gathered on
   demographic and clinical variables. Telepsychiatry satisfaction was
   assessed using a questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and chi-square
   tests were used to assess group differences for each variable. Logistic
   regression was used to assess impact of the variables on outcome after
   the consult. A p value < 0.05 was used to determine statistical
   significance.
   Results: Sixty (n = 60) assessments were conducted through
   telepsychiatry in 12 months. Among the telepsychiatry group, Aboriginal
   patients were over-represented (50\% vs. 6.7\%, p < 0.001), a higher
   proportion received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder (22\% vs. 8.3\%,
   p = 0.004) or no diagnosis (27\% vs. 6.7\%, p = 0.004) compared with
   controls. There was no statistically significant difference between
   groups on other clinical variables. Patients reported a high degree of
   satisfaction with telepsychiatry.
   Conclusions: Telepsychiatry is acceptable to patients and families for
   safe emergency assessment and follow-up, reducing unnecessary travel to
   urban centers. Longer time outcomes are needed to establish validity of
   telepsychiatry for emergency assessments.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify potential access to telemedicine followup of
   children with clefts operated on a humanitarian mission.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of parents of children presenting to a
   humanitarian cleft lip and palate mission in a Provincial Hospital in
   the Philippines. A purpose designed questionnaire was used to assess
   access to electronic and digital resources that could be used to aid
   follow-up. Fortyfive (N = 45) parents of children having primary cleft
   lip and or palate surgery participated. There were no interventions.
   Access to the Internet was through Parent Perceived Affordability of
   Internet Access and Parent Owned Devices.
   Results: Thirty-one (N = 31) respondents were female. There was 93\%
   mobile phone ownership. The mean distance traveled to the clinic was 187
   km. Majority (56\%) were fluent in English. Thirty-one percent accessed
   the Internet daily. Sixteen percent reported use of e-mail. Fifty-one
   percent accessed the Internet on a mobile device, and short message

Pages = {{852-862}},

Abstract = {{Background: Children often have difficulty accessing subspecialty care,
   and telemedicine may improve access to subspecialty care, but
   information is lacking on how best to implement telemedicine programs to
   maximize acceptance and, ultimately, maximize impact for patients and
   their families.
   Methods and Materials: To understand how subspecialty telemedicine is
   perceived and to identify design elements with the potential to improve
   telemedicine uptake and impact, we conducted and analyzed
   semi-structured interviews with 21 informants, including parents and
   caregivers of children with subspecialty care needs and adolescent and
   young adult patients with subspecialty care needs.
   Results: Although informants saw the potential value of using
   telemedicine to replace in-person subspecialty visits, they were more
   enthusiastic about using telemedicine to complement rather than replace
   in-person visits. For example, they described the potential to use
   telemedicine to facilitate previsit triage encounters to assess whether
   the patientwas being scheduled with the correct subspecialist and with
   the appropriate level of urgency. They also felt that telemedicine would
   be useful for communication with subspecialists after scheduled
   in-person visits for follow-up questions, care coordination, and to
   discuss changes in health status. Informants felt that it was important
   for telemedicine programs to have transparent and reliable scheduling,
   same-day scheduling options, continuity of care with trusted providers,
   clear guidelines on when to use telemedicine, and preservation of parent
   choice regarding method of care delivery.
   Conclusions: Parents and patients articulated preferences regarding
   pediatric subspecialty telemedicine in this qualitative,
   hypothesis-generating study. Understanding and responding to patient and
   caregiver perceptions and preferences will be crucial to ensure that
   telemedicine drives true innovation in care delivery rather than simply
   recapitulating prior models of care.}},

Abstract = {{Background:A gap in childhood cancer outcomes remains between developed
   and developing countries. Persistence of this gap may be caused by
   financial, social, or educational disparities. Twinning and distance
   learning initiatives may improve such disparities. Integrating
   telemedicine into pediatric oncology twinning programs enhances
   education and facilitates patient-centered capacity building.
   Materials and Methods:We performed an analysis of Web-based meetings
   held from August 2005 through July 2009 between the International
   Outreach Program at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the
   Instituto Materno Infantil de Pernambuco (IMIP) in Recife, Brazil. We
   determined the effect of these online conferences on the development and
   implementation of an innovative protocol for children with acute
   lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at IMIP.
   Results:Meetings occurred in 45 months of the 48-month study period with
   an average of two meetings per month. A total of 163 new patients were
   discussed during the study period; we retrieved documentation of
   patient-related discussions for 147 of them, constituting 286
   discussions. On average, each patient was discussed 1.9 times (range,
   1-15 discussions/patient). Compared with that of the era predating the
   online meetings (1993-2005), overall mortality, early death, and relapse
   of patients with ALL decreased after the telemedicine program was
   instituted at IMIP.
   Discussion:Personal dedication and institutional support are essential
   for successful telemedicine initiatives. Documentation and archival of
   meetings are important for accurately measuring outcomes and developing
   methods for improved care.
   Conclusions:Integration of telemedicine into twinning programs
   facilitates communication about interventions, leading to improved
   outcomes of pediatric patients with cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Every year, approximately 62,000 people with stroke and transient

   the Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations Telestroke guideline
   is a comprehensive summary of current evidence-based and consensus-based
   recommendations appropriate for use by all healthcare providers and
   system planners who organize and provide care to patients following
   stroke across a broad range of settings. These recommendations focus on
   the use of telemedicine technologies to rapidly identify and treat
   appropriate patients with acute thrombolytic therapies in hospitals
   without stroke specialized expertise; select patients who require to
   immediate transfer to stroke centers for Endovascular Therapy; and for
   the patients who remain in community hospitals to facilitate their care
   on a stroke unit and provide remote access to stroke prevention and
   rehabilitation services. While these latter areas of Telestroke
   application are newer, they are rapidly developing, with new
   opportunities that are yet unrealized. Virtual rehabilitation therapies
   offer patients the opportunity to participate in rehabilitation
   therapies, supervised by physical and occupational therapists. While not
   without its limitations (e.g., access to telecommunications in remote
   areas, fragmentation of care), the evidence-to-date sets the foundation
   for improving access to care and management for patients during both the
   acute phase and now through post stroke recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Most outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT)
   services use a hospital-based model of care in which patients remain in
   proximity to large hospitals facilitating clinical review. We aimed to
   evaluate clinical outcomes and complication rates for patients living in
   geographically isolated locations managed by telemedicine-supported
   OPAT.
   Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study.
   Results: Between 2011 and 2015, we delivered 88 episodes of care
   involving 83 adult patients resulting in 2261 days of OPAT. The median
   age was 56 years, 8 of 83 (10\%) were indigenous Australian and the
   median Charlson comorbidity index score was 2 (IQR 1-4). The median
   distance of patients' residence from our hospital was 288 km (IQR
   201-715) and the median duration on the programme was 26 days (IQR
   14-34). Bone and joint infections accounted for 75\% of infections
   treated. Favourable clinical outcomes (improvement or cure) were
   achieved in 87\% of patients and the unplanned, OPAT-related readmission
   rate was 8\%. Nineteen percent and 10\% of patients had drug-related and
   line-related adverse effects, respectively.
   Conclusions: Despite a complex case mix, our adverse event and
   readmission rates are similar to the published literature describing a
   non-telemedicine model to deliver OPAT. High rates of favourable
   clinical outcomes and likely cost benefits suggest that
   telemedicine-supported OPAT is an efficacious and safe substitute for
   inpatient care in our setting.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To compare the proportion of medical abortions with a
   clinically significant adverse event among telemedicine and in-person
   patients at a clinic system in Iowa during the first 7 years of the
   service.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study. We analyzed data on
   clinically significant adverse events (hospital admission, surgery,
   blood transfusion, emergency department treatment, and death) for all
   medical abortions performed by telemedicine or in person at a clinic
   system in Iowa between July 1, 2008, and June 30, 2015. Data on adverse
   events came from required reporting forms submitted to the mifepristone
   distributor. We calculated the prevalence of adverse events and 95\% CIs
   comparing telemedicine with in-person patients. The analysis was
   designed as a noninferiority study. Assuming the prevalence of adverse
   events to be 0.3\%, telemedicine provision was considered to be inferior
   to in-person provision if the prevalence were 0.6\% or higher. The
   required sample size was 6,984 in each group (one-sided alpha=0.025,
   power 90\%). To explore whether patients with adverse events presented
   to emergency departments and were not reported, we conducted a survey of
   the 119 emergency departments in Iowa, asking whether they had treated a
   woman with an adverse event in the prior year.
   RESULTS: During the study period, 8,765 telemedicine and 10,405
   in-person medical abortions were performed. Forty-nine clinically
   significant adverse events were reported (no deaths or surgery; 0.18\%
   of telemedicine patients with any adverse event {[}95\% CI 0.11-0.29\%]
   and 0.32\% of in-person patients {[}95\% CI 0.23-0.45\%]). The
   difference in adverse event prevalence was 0.13\% (95\% CI -0.01\% to
   0.28\%, P=.07). Forty-two emergency departments responded to the survey
   (35\% response rate); none reported treating a woman with an adverse
   event after medical abortion.
   CONCLUSION: Adverse events are rare with medical abortion, and
   telemedicine provision is noninferior to inperson provision with regard
   to clinically significant adverse events.}},

Journal = {{PREVENTIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{20-25}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Many intimate partner homicide victims visit emergency departments (EDs)
   prior to their deaths, yet their lethality risk is notwell understood.
   eHealth interventions for intimate partner violence (IPV) improve
   provider information, tailor care to victim need and link victims to
   services. We analyzed ED patients' lethality risk using one such
   intervention, Domestic Violence Report and Referral (DVRR). DVRR records
   were assessed for 263 female patients aged 16 and older seen for IPV at
   an urban, high-traffic, Northern California ED in 2014-15. Multiple
   linear regression was used to test the association of children's
   presence at home, pregnancy, age, and abuser-victim relationship with
   victim's lethality risk using the Danger Assessment (DA) score from the
   Lethality Risk Assessment for Intimate Partner Femicide. Differences in
   means were assessed using t- and F-tests. The mean DA score indicated
   high lethality risk, with a third of respondents (33.1\%) reporting very
   high DA scores. Multiple linear regression models indicated that
   increasing victim age (beta=0.20/year; 95\% CI: 0.11-0.29), children's
   presence at home (beta=2.61, 95\% CI: 0.63-4.58), and perpetrator
   reported as dating partner (beta=4.50, 95\% CI: 1.62-7.38) or ex-partner
   (beta=4.38, 95\% CI: 1.10-7.66) were significantly associated with the
   DA score (p < 0.05). Use of DA scores as ED risk assessment tools in
   response to IPV victimization could help hospital staff and IPV
   advocates direct resources toward highest-need patients, improving
   health outcomes without additional burden on hospitals. These results
   also foreground eHealth interventions' utility in linking providers and
   IPV advocates and reducing the risk of intimate partner homicide. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents an outline of methods that have been proposed for
   the analysis of chronic wound images. This paper indicates the details
   of four different ulcerous cases, provides good treatment policy,
   enhances quality of patient's life, improves evidence based clinical
   outcomes and suggests best possible issues. This paper investigates
   efficient filtering techniques for chronic wound image pre-processing
   under Tele-wound network. The aim of this work is to accurately access
   the healing status of chronic wound with improved image processing
   techniques by proper filtering. Efficient filtering techniques help to
   reduce the noise for wound images. The simulation results are presented
   by comparing different parameters. Performance parameters are peak
   signal to noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), signal to noise
   ratio and mean absolute error. Results shows adaptive Median filtering
   provides better performances with respect to high PSNR and reduced MSE
   between original and filtered image. This work proposes the Particle
   Swarm Optimization (PSO) method for segmentation of wound areas via
   suitable color space selection. The PSO algorithm in D-b channel
   provided good accuracy (98.93\%) for chronic wound segmentation. Here
   proposed Linier discriminant analysis classifier provides 98\% overall
   tissue prediction accuracy. The aim is to develop telemedicine framework
   for wound diagnosis by improving good interaction between health
   experts, patients, and tele-medical agents who belongs to rural/urban
   areas that are involved in the provision of care to resolve the delayed

   2015), Web of Science (1900 to July 2015), and Scopus (1946 to July
   2015) databases. We included studies that demonstrated the use of
   telemedicine for diagnosis and/or management of inflammatory/autoimmune
   rheumatic disease. Following data extraction, we performed a descriptive
   analysis.
   Results: Our literature search identified 1,468 potentially eligible
   studies. Of these studies, 20 were ultimately included in this review.
   Studies varied significantly in publication type, quality of evidence,
   and the reporting of methods. Most demonstrated a high risk of bias.
   Rheumatoid arthritis was the most commonly studied rheumatic disease
   (42\% of patients). Studies demonstrated conflicting results regarding
   the effectiveness of telemedicine (18 found it effective, 1 found it
   effective but possibly harmful, and 1 found it ineffective). A limited
   number of studies included some component of a cost analysis (n = 6;
   16\% of patients); all of these found telemedicine to be cost-effective.
   Conclusion: Studies identified by this systematic review generally found
   telemedicine to be effective for the diagnosis and management of
   autoimmune/inflammatory rheumatic disease; however, there is limited
   evidence to support this conclusion. Further studies are needed to
   determine the best uses of telemedicine for the diagnosis and management
   of these conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite the advances in the diagnosis and treatment of heart
   failure (HF), the current hospital-oriented framework for HF management
   does not appear to be sufficient to maintain the stability of HF
   patients in the long term. The importance of self-care management is
   increasingly being emphasized as a promising long-term treatment
   strategy for patients with chronic HF.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a new
   information communication technology (ICT)-based telehealth program with
   voice recognition technology could improve clinical or laboratory
   outcomes in HF patients.
   Methods: In this prospective single-arm pilot study, we recruited 31
   consecutive patients with chronic HF who were referred to our institute.
   An ICT-based telehealth program with voice recognition technology was
   developed and used by patients with HF for 12 weeks. Patients were
   educated on the use of this program via mobile phone, landline, or the
   Internet for the purpose of improving communication and data collection.
   Using these systems, we collected comprehensive data elements related to
   the risk of HF self-care management such as weight, diet, exercise,
   medication adherence, overall symptom change, and home blood pressure.
   The study endpoints were the changes observed in urine sodium
   concentration (uNa), Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHFQ) scores,
   6-min walk test, and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide
   (NT-proBNP) as surrogate markers for appropriate HF management.
   Results: Among the 31 enrolled patients, 27 (87\%) patients completed
   the study, and 10 (10/27, 37\%) showed good adherence to ICT-based
   telehealth program with voice recognition technology, which was defined
   as the use of the program for 100 times or more during the study period.
   Nearly three-fourths of the patients had been hospitalized at least once
   because of HF before the enrollment (20/27, 74\%); 14 patients had 1, 2
   patients had 2, and 4 patients had 3 or more previous HF
   hospitalizations. In the total study population, there was no
   significant interval change in laboratory and functional outcome
   variables after 12 weeks of ICT-based telehealth program. In patients
   with good adherence to ICT-based telehealth program, there was a
   significant improvement in the mean uNa (103.1 to 78.1; P=.01) but not
   in those without (85.4 to 96.9; P=.49). Similarly, a marginal
   improvement in MLHFQ scores was only observed in patients with good
   adherence (27.5 to 21.4; P=.08) but not in their counterparts (19.0 to
   19.7; P=.73). The mean 6-min walk distance and NT-proBNP were not
   significantly increased in patients regardless of their adherence.
   Conclusions: Short-term application of ICT-based telehealth program with
   voice recognition technology showed the potential to improve uNa values
   and MLHFQ scores in HF patients, suggesting that better control of
   sodium intake and greater quality of life can be achieved by this
   program.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the rapid market penetration of smartphones and the development
   of context-aware ubiquitous healthcare services, the demand for
   ubiquitous healthcare service-to monitor patients' longitudinal health
   data continuously and cope with emergency situations-has rapidly
   increased. Recent developments have suggested that researchers need to
   provide policy-makers with accessible and reliable information regarding
   the role of ubiquitous healthcare services. The objective of this study
   is to investigate the impact of ubiquitous healthcare services on the
   South Korean economy, using a static input-output approach. We address
   topics relating to the input-output model, such as the demand-driven
   model and inter-linkage effects, and the components inherent in an
   unconventional input-output model, such as the supply-driven model and
   the Leontief price model. The results indicate that the ubiquitous
   healthcare industry as a final primary production sector has strong
   production-inducing effects, weak price ripple effects, and marginal
   backward and forward linkage effects. It is also found that the industry
   is closely related to the electric and electronic device sector and the
   precision machinery sector. This is largely attributable to the
   convergence characteristics of industries that use wireless
   telecommunications, as well as those of the medical and measurement
   device and medical service sectors.}},

Abstract = {{Point-of-care diagnosis based on nucleic acid testing aims to
   incorporate all the analytical steps, from sample preparation to nucleic
   acid amplification and detection, in a single device. This device needs
   to provide a low-cost, robust, sensitive, specific, and easily readable
   analysis. Microfluidics has great potential for handling small volumes
   of fluids on a single platform. Microfluidic technology has recently
   been applied to paper, which is already used in low-cost lateral flow
   tests. Nucleic acid extraction from a biological specimen usually
   requires cell filtration and lysis on specific membranes, while affinity
   matrices, such as chitosan or polydiacetylene, are well suited to
   concentrating nucleic acids for subsequent amplification. Access to
   electricity is often difficult in resource-limited areas, so the
   amplification step needs to be equipment-free. Consequently, the
   reaction has to be isothermal to alleviate the need for a thermocycler.
   LAMP, NASBA, HDA, and RPA are examples of the technologies available.
   Nucleic acid detection techniques are currently based on fluorescence,
   colorimetry, or chemiluminescence. For point-of-care diagnostics, the
   results should be readable with the naked eye. Nowadays, interpretation
   and communication of results to health professionals could rely on a
   smartphone, used as a telemedicine device. The major challenge of
   creating an ``all-in-one{''} diagnostic test involves the design of an
   optimal solution and a sequence for each analytical step, as well as
   combining the execution of all these steps on a single device. This
   review provides an overview of available materials and technologies
   which seem to be adapted to point-of-care nucleic acid-based diagnosis,

Abstract = {{The Stanford University Network for the Diagnosis of Retinopathy of
   Prematurity (SUNDROP) initiative-an ongoing telemedicine-based
   initiative for in-hospital screening of high-risk infants for
   treatment-warranted ROP (TW-ROP)-has been shown to be a safe, reliable,
   and cost-effective supplement to the efforts of ROP specialists. We
   utilized data collected in the SUNDROP initiative to determine
   demographic (birth weight, sex, multiplicity), weight gain, and ocular
   imaging (media haze, peripapillary atrophy, fundus pigmentation)
   predictors of TW-ROP.
   This was a retrospective nested case-control study. Cases and controls
   were selected from a cohort of 843 low birth weight, premature newborns
   who survived to an estimated gestational age of 31 weeks and underwent
   screening through the SUNDROP initiative. Infants were screened at one
   of six neonatal intensive care units from December 1, 2005, to April 1,
   2016. Cases (n = 37) were newborns with TW-ROP who underwent retinal
   ablative therapy. Two controls (n = 74) without TW-ROP were matched to
   each case by gestational age. One reviewer graded media haze, presence
   of peripapillary atrophy, and fundus pigmentation in images taken at the
   baseline exam for each newborn. The main outcome measure was association
   of TW-ROP with predictive factors.
   In the SUNDROP trial, 37 out of 843 (4.4\%) newborns developed TW-ROP.
   In a multivariable model, birth weight (OR, 0.32; 95\% CI, 0.15-0.70)
   was inversely associated with TW-ROP. In contrast to prior reports, we
   found no significant difference in sex, multiplicity, or fundus
   pigmentation at baseline exam in those with TW-ROP as compared to
   controls. High levels of media haze (> 2, scale 0 to 5) were found in
   the majority of cases (67.6\%, 25/37) and controls (65.7\%, 44/67).
   Presence of peripapillary atrophy did not improve prediction of the
   development of TW-ROP compared to birth weight and weight gain rate
   alone.
   The finding of high levels of media haze at baseline ROP screening exams
   is novel. This study supports the current model for detection of TW-ROP
   using birth weight, gestational age, and weight gain rate. We found no
   significant difference between newborns with TW-ROP and controls in
   baseline presence of media haze, fundus pigmentation or peripapillary
   atrophy.}},

Abstract = {{Aims and objectivesTo develop a theory that offered an evidence-based
   insight into the use of teleconsultation by nurses.
   BackgroundTeleconsultation is the use of video to facilitate real-time,
   remote interaction between healthcare practitioners and patients.
   Although its popularity is growing, there is little understanding of how
   teleconsultation impacts on the role of nurses.
   DesignThe study adopted a constructivist grounded theory method,
   supplemented by the use of Straussian analytical approaches.
   MethodsUsing selective and theoretical approaches, registered nurses
   with experience of using video in health care were sampled. Data were
   collected using semi-structured interviews exploring experiences,
   knowledge and feelings surrounding teleconsultation. Interviews were
   recorded, transcribed and subjected to three-stage, nonlinear manual
   analysis (open, axial and selective coding).
   ResultsTheoretical saturation occurred after 17 interviews. The core
   category identified from the data was nursing presence' Four
   subcategories of nursing presence were identified: operational,
   clinical, therapeutic and social. The degree to which presence could be
   achieved was dependent upon three influencing factors - enablers,
   constraints and compensation.
   ConclusionsNurses provide different types of presence during
   teleconsultation, with the degree of presence dependent on specific
   characteristics of video-mediated communication. Where the use of video
   constrains the delivery of presence, nurses use a range of compensatory
   mechanisms to enhance patient care.
   Relevance to clinical practiceTeleconsultation provides an innovative
   approach to enhancing the delivery of health care. This study provides
   nurses with insight into the impact of teleconsultation on their
   professional role, and an understanding of how best to use
   video-mediated communication to support patient care.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) practice profile
   surveys have been conducted for more than a decade to gauge trends in
   our workforce supply and demand. Objective: To update the trends and
   current workforce issues for the field of dermatology.
   Methods: The AAD Practice Profile Survey is sent by both e-mail and
   postal mail to a random sample of practicing dermatologists who are AAD
   members.
   Results: Shifts are noted in the primary practice setting; fewer
   dermatologists are in solo practice and more are in group practices than
   in previous years. Teledermatology use trended upward from 7\% to 11\%
   between 2012 and 2014. The implementation of electronic health records
   increased from 51\% in 2011 to 70\% in 2014.
   Limitations: There is potential for response bias and inaccurate
   self-reporting. Survey responses collected may not be representative of
   all geographic areas.
   Conclusion: The demand for dermatology services remains strong. Shifts
   in the practice setting may be related to increases in overhead costs
   that are partially associated with the implementation of
   technology-based medical records. Integration of electronic health
   records and utilization of telemedicine are increasing.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of
   self-monitoring of blood pressure with a semiautomatic device in
   pregnant women.
   Participants and methods Women attending routine obstetrical ultrasound
   scanning were invited to participate. The hospital staff initially
   demonstrated and instructed each participant in correct measurement and
   then took three measurements on both arms. The participant then repeated
   the measurements and filled an evaluation questionnaire. We used a
   validated semiautomatic device for all measurements. Mean values were
   calculated for systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure
   (MAP) and were compared using the paired sample t-test. Mean values and
   differences of systolic and diastolic pressure were plotted in
   Bland-Altman plots to test the agreement of the measurements. Finally, a
   mean evaluation score was calculated.
   Results One hundred pregnant women were included in the study. Mean
   values of systolic, diastolic and MAP were 110.6, 69.7 and 83.3 mmHg,
   respectively, as assessed by the hospital staff. The corresponding
   self-measurements were 111.4, 70.2 and 83.9 mmHg, respectively. Mean
   differences between hospital and self-measurements were 0.79mmHg for
   systolic {[}P= 0.052, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=-0.008 to 1.58],
   0.49 mmHg for diastolic (P= 0.056, 95\% CI=-0.01 to 0.99) and 0.59 mmHg
   for MAP (P= 0.019, 95\% CI= 0.099-1.08). The mean evaluation score was
   9.2 of 10.
   Conclusion Differences between hospital staff and self-measurements in
   systolic, diastolic and MAP are within acceptable international
   standards. The semiautomatic device Microlife-VSA is well suited for
   self-measurement; however, safety studies on the use of home
   measurements in hypertensive pregnancies are still warranted. Copyright

Abstract = {{Literature on telehealth care delivery often addresses clinical, cost,
   technological, system, and organizational impacts. Less is known about
   interpersonal behaviors such as communication patterns and therapeutic
   relationship-building, which may have workforce development
   considerations. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic
   literature review to identify interpersonal health care provider (HCP)
   behaviors and attributes related to provider-patient interaction during
   care in telehealth delivery. Electronic searches were conducted using
   five indexes/databases: CINAHL, ERIC, PsychInfo, ProQuest Dissertations,
   PubMed; with hand-searching of the immediate past 10 years of five
   journals. Search concepts included: communication, telehealth,
   education, and health care delivery. Of 5261 unique article abstracts
   initially identified, 338 full-text articles remained after exclusion
   criteria were applied and these were reviewed for eligibility. Finally,
   data were extracted from 45 articles. Through qualitative synthesis of
   the 45 articles, we noted that papers encompassed many disciplines and
   targeted care to people in many settings including: home care, primary
   and specialist care, mental health/counseling, and multi-site teams.
   Interpersonal behaviors were observed though not manipulated through
   study designs. Six themes were identified: HCP-based support for
   telehealth delivery; provider-patient interactions during the telehealth
   event; environmental attributes; and guidelines for education
   interventions or evaluation of HCP behaviors. Although unable to
   identify current best practices, important considerations for practice
   and education did emerge. These include: perceptions of the utility of
   telehealth; differences in communication patterns such as pace and type
   of discourse, reliance on visual cues by both provider and patient
   especially in communicating empathy and building rapport; and
   confidentiality and privacy in telehealth care delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   The developing world carries a disproportionate burden of hearing loss.
   Individuals with hearing loss in austere settings worldwide are also
   potentially impacted by their impairment to a greater extent owing to
   underdeveloped or nonexistent hearing health infrastructure. The purpose
   of this review is to examine the state of the literature on hearing
   health access in developing countries and identify areas for
   improvement.
   Recent findings
   Over the last 10 years progress has been made in some areas, whereas
   other aspects of hearing health in developing countries have changed
   very little. There has been expansion of efforts to train primary care
   and local hearing healthcare providers to recognize and appropriately
   treat preventable causes of hearing loss in the developing world.
   Applications of telehealth to connect providers and patients in rural
   locales have grown. Adaptions of newborn hearing screening programs that
   better fit local resources and customs have been reported. There has
   been a considerable increase in interest, including cost-benefit
   analyses, with regard to the use of cochlear implants in the developing
   world.
   Summary
   In spite of progress, the developing world still shoulders a
   disproportionate amount of the world's hearing loss, in particular
   chronic ear disease, and there is a paucity of well trained local
   hearing healthcare professionals to deal with the challenge. The role of
   international humanitarian efforts, telemedicine, and education is
   highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   There are significant disparities in care facing children with hearing
   loss. The objective of this review is to assess the current disparities
   in pediatric hearing healthcare delivery, describe the barriers of
   efficient and effective pediatric hearing health care, and explore the
   innovations to improve pediatric hearing healthcare delivery.
   Recent findings
   Children with hearing loss from certain geographic regions or ethnic
   background are significantly delayed in diagnosis and treatment.
   Multiple patient characteristics (presentation of hearing loss),
   parental factors (insurance status, socioeconomic status, educational
   status, and travel distance to providers), and provider barriers
   (specialist shortage and primary care provider challenges) prevent the
   delivery of timely hearing health care. Advances, such as improved
   screening programs and the expansion of care through remote services,
   may help to ameliorate these disparities.
   Summary
   Timely identification and treatment of pediatric hearing loss is
   critical to prevent lifelong language complications. Children from
   vulnerable populations, such as rural residents, face significant
   disparities in care. Careful assessment of these barriers and
   implementation of culturally acceptable interventions are paramount to
   maximize communication outcomes of children with hearing loss.}},

Abstract = {{As chronic diseases and demographic changes alter the trends in world
   population, more pressure is put on health management to deal
   efficiently with a new scenario of longer life expectancy and chronic
   disabilities. Advances in telecommunication technology and
   miniaturization of sensors in combination with medical information
   technology provide a viable solution to reduce healthcare costs and
   deliver remote medical services through connected devices. Although
   remote consultation via video-conferencing has been well established,
   many of the chronic or long-term musculoskeletal conditions require
   proactive management and therapy. There is a need to develop more
   advanced interactive telerehabilitation systems that support real-time
   remote delivery of physical therapy sessions into patients' homes. In
   this paper, we introduce KinectRTC, an innovative framework that can be
   used for Kinect-based telerehabilitation with efficient real-time
   transmission of video, audio, depth, and skeletal data. By taking
   advantage of the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) technology, the
   proposed framework is able to manage video and audio streams based on
   the state of the network and the available bandwidth to guarantee the
   real-time performance of the communication. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Physicians' perceptions on the impact of telemedicine on recruitment and
   retention in underserved areas: a descriptive study in Senegal}},
Journal = {{HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Similar to many places, physicians in Senegal are unevenly
   distributed. Telemedicine is considered a potential solution to this
   problem. This study investigated the perceptions of Senegal's physicians
   of the impact of telemedicine on their recruitment to and retention in
   underserved areas.
   Methods: We conducted individual interviews with a random sample of 60
   physicians in Senegal, including 30 physicians working in public
   hospitals and 30 physicians working in district health centres between
   January and June 2014, as part of a mixed methods study. Data were
   collected using a semi-structured interview guide comprising both
   open-and close-ended questions. Interviews were recorded, transcribed
   and coded thematically using NVivo 10 software using a priori and
   emergent codes. Participants' characteristics were analyzed
   descriptively using SPSS 23.
   Results: The impact of telemedicine on physicians' recruitment and
   retention in underserved areas was perceived with some variability.
   Among the physicians who were interviewed, most (36) thought that
   telemedicine could have a positive impact on their recruitment and
   retention but many (24) believed the opposite. The advantages noted by
   the first included telemedicine's ability to break their professional
   isolation and reduce the stress related to this, facilitate their
   distance learning and improve their working conditions. They did
   acknowledge that it is not sufficient in itself, an opinion also shared
   by physicians who did not believe that telemedicine could affect their
   recruitment and retention. Both identified contextual, economic,
   educational, family, individual, organizational and professional factors
   as influential.
   Conclusion: Based on these opinions of physicians, telemedicine
   promotion is one intervention that, alongside others, could be promoted
   to assist in addressing the multiple factors that influence physicians'
   recruitment and retention in underserved areas.}},

Title = {{Tele-neurology in sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review of the
   literature}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{380}},
Pages = {{196-199}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: The rapid advancement in telecommunications on the African
   continent has opened up avenues for improving medical care to
   underserved populations. Although the greatest burden of neurological
   disorders is borne by Low-and-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) including
   sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there is a profound paucity of neurologists to
   serve the population. Telemedicine presents a promising avenue for
   effective mobilization and utilization of the few neurologists in
   Africa.
   Objective: To systematically review the published literature on the use
   of telemedicine for improved care and outcomes for patients with
   neurological disorders in SSA.
   Methods: We searched PubMed and Cochrane library from January 1, 1980 to
   April 30, 2017 using the following
   keywords: ``Telemedicine neurology Africa{''}, ``Teleneurology
   Africa{''}, ``Telestroke Africa{''}, ``Telerehabilitation Africa{''},
   ``Telemedicine for epilepsy{''}, ``Telemedicine for Parkinson's disease
   Africa{''}, ``Telemedicine for dementia Africa{''}, ``Telehealth
   neurology Africa{''}. Our inclusion criteria were randomized controlled
   trials, or case series that reported the utilization of telemedicine for
   care/education of individuals with neurological disorders in sub-Saharan
   Africa.
   Results: This search yielded 6 abstracts. By consensus between two
   investigators, 1 publication met the criteria for inclusion and further
   review. The one study identified utilized telemedicine for the purpose
   of improving education/knowledge of 16 doctors and 17 allied health
   professionals in Parkinson's disease (PD) in Cameroon. The study noted
   feasibility and satisfaction of participants with telemedicine as well
   as improved knowledge base of participants after the educational course
   but noted access to healthcare by patients did not change. No studies
   have evaluated the use of telemedicine for care of patients with
   neurological disorders.
   Conclusion: The indication is that teleneurology may be feasible in SSA
   and studies are needed to assess feasibility, acceptability, efficacy,
   cost-effectiveness of this promising discipline of neurology in these
   resource -limited settings. We propose the setting up of trans
   continental, inter-regional, intra-regional, and national networks of
   neurologists to utilize teleneurology platforms to improve the reach of
   neurology care in SSA. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{``Maybe we should talk about it anyway{''}: a qualitative study of
   understanding expectations and use of an established technology
   innovation in caring practices}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Technological innovations are strongly promoted to meet the
   demands posed by increased pressure on home care services and to assist
   ageing in place in western societies. Although heavily advocated as plug
   and play solutions, technologies have proven difficult and unpredictable
   when integrated into home care services. We need greater insight into
   what happens when technologies are integrated into caring practices. All
   technologies come with expectations as to their function. This study
   explores how actors who are involved with the social alarm, which is an
   established technology innovation, relate to, perceive and articulate
   these expectations of the technology in everyday living.
   Methods: The article presents results from a two-case study, using a
   triangulation of qualitative methods in order to gain an in-depth
   understanding of technology in use in home care services through ``thick
   descriptions{''}. The study was conducted in Norway and data were
   analysed using a stepwise deductive-inductive analysis.
   Results: The empirical findings demonstrate that expectations regarding
   the social alarm, even though it represents a simple and
   well-established technology, are complex and multidimensional. The
   notion of script and domestication provided relevant tools for exploring
   these expectations and for understanding how actors interpret and adapt
   their practices of using the technology. This enabled a more
   comprehensive understanding of how technology opens up for different
   interpretations and puts values in play.
   Conclusions: This article suggests exploring technology in use as
   scripted in multidimensional script, and offers a frame for doing so. It
   also reveals how technology scripts and articulation prove important for
   understanding the complex reality when integrated into home care
   practices, thus identifying how using the technology leads to the taming
   and unleashing of both technology and actors. The study offers an
   increased understanding of how and why technology is unpredictable and
   works differently in different contexts. Moreover, it stresses the
   importance of avoiding expectations of plug-and-play in a reality of
   complex interactions between different actors.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether providing remote neurologic care into
   the homes of people with Parkinson disease (PD) is feasible, beneficial,
   and valuable.
   Methods: In a 1-year randomized controlled trial, we compared usual care
   to usual care supplemented by 4 virtual visits via video conferencing
   from a remote specialist into patients' homes. Primary outcome measures
   were feasibility, as measured by the proportion who completed at least
   one virtual visit and the proportion of virtual visits completed on
   time; and efficacy, as measured by the change in the Parkinson's Disease
   Questionnaire-39, a quality of life scale. Secondary outcomes included
   quality of care, caregiver burden, and time and travel savings.
   Results: A total of 927 individuals indicated interest, 210 were
   enrolled, and 195 were randomized. Participants had recently seen a
   specialist (73\%) and were largely college-educated (73\%) and white
   (96\%). Ninety-five (98\% of the intervention group) completed at least
   one virtual visit, and 91\% of 388 virtual visits were completed.
   Quality of life did not improve in those receiving virtual house calls
   (0.3 points worse on a 100-point scale; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   22.0 to 2.7 points; p = 0.78) nor did quality of care or caregiver
   burden. Each virtual house call saved patients a median of 88 minutes
   (95\% CI 70-120; p < 0.0001) and 38 miles per visit (95\% CI 36-56; p <
   0.0001).
   Conclusions: Providing remote neurologic care directly into the homes of
   people with PD was feasible and was neither more nor less efficacious
   than usual in-person care. Virtual house calls generated great interest
   and provided substantial convenience. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
   NCT02038959. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III
   evidence that for patients with PD, virtual house calls from a
   neurologist are feasible and do not significantly change quality of life
   compared to in-person visits. The study is rated Class III because it
   was not possible to mask patients to visit type.}},

Abstract = {{Problem/Condition: Genetic testing for breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and
   breast cancer 2 (BRCA2) gene mutations can identify women at increased
   risk for breast and ovarian cancer. These testing results can be used to
   select preventive interventions and guide treatment. Differences between
   nonmetropolitan and metropolitan populations in rates of BRCA testing
   and receipt of preventive interventions after testing have not
   previously been examined.
   Period Covered: 2009-2014.
   Description of System: Medical claims data from Truven Health Analytics
   MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters databases were used to
   estimate rates of BRCA testing and receipt of preventive interventions
   after BRCA testing among women aged 18-64 years with employer-sponsored
   health insurance in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas of the United
   States, both nationally and regionally.
   Results: From 2009 to 2014, BRCA testing rates per 100,000 women aged
   18-64 years with employer-sponsored health insurance increased 2.3 times
   (102.7 to 237.8) in metropolitan areas and 3.0 times (64.8 to 191.3) in
   nonmetropolitan areas. The relative difference in BRCA testing rates
   between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas decreased from 37\% in
   2009 (102.7 versus 64.8) to 20\% in 2014 (237.8 versus 191.3). The
   relative difference in BRCA testing rates between metropolitan and
   nonmetropolitan areas decreased more over time in younger women than in
   older women and decreased in all regions except the West. Receipt of
   preventive services 90 days after BRCA testing in metropolitan versus
   nonmetropolitan areas throughout the period varied by service: the
   percentage of women who received a mastectomy was similar, the
   percentage of women who received magnetic resonance imaging of the
   breast was lower in nonmetropolitan areas (as low as 5.8\% in 2014 to as
   high as 8.2\% in 2011) than metropolitan areas (as low as 7.3\% in 2014
   to as high as 10.3\% in 2011), and the percentage of women who received
   mammography was lower in nonmetropolitan areas in earlier years but was
   similar in later years.
   Interpretation: Possible explanations for the 47\% decrease in the
   relative difference in BRCA testing rates over the study period include
   increased access to genetic services in nonmetropolitan areas and
   increased demand nationally as a result of publicity. The relative
   differences in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan BRCA testing rates were
   smaller among women at younger ages compared with older ages.
   Public Health Action: Improved data sources and surveillance tools are
   needed to gather comprehensive data on BRCA testing in the United
   States, monitor adherence to evidence-based guidelines for BRCA testing,
   and assess receipt of preventive interventions for women with BRCA
   mutations. Programs can build on the recent decrease in geographic
   disparities in receipt of BRCA testing while simultaneously educating
   the public and health care providers about U.S. Preventive Services Task
   Force recommendations and other clinical guidelines for BRCA testing and
   counseling.}},

Abstract = {{Telehealth is a way to provide health-care services to a patient from a
   provider who is at another location. The most common methods include a
   live interactive visit with the patient, interpretation of imaging, and
   monitoring of patient progress. Principally, telehealth is a way of
   providing a service rather than a type of service. It is about patient
   care, not data care.
   Examples of orthopaedic applications include conducting patient
   examinations, interpreting imaging studies, and providing postoperative
   care. Teleconsultation has been shown to be cost-effective. Other
   examples in orthopaedic research include the application of telemedicine
   when measuring patient-reported outcomes. Especially in cases when the
   patient lives far away from the provider, telehealth reduces time,
   produces good patient satisfaction, and costs less than hands-on care.
   As in everyday life, consumers have learned to demand convenience, ease
   of use, choice, control, and direct access. The ubiquity of
   telecommunications, combined with consumer technology savviness, drives
   the demand for telehealth. Unfortunately, the nation's largest payer for
   health services is one of the most restrictive for telehealth coverage.
   Medicare's restrictions are mostly the work of the U.S. Congress under
   Part B law. Video visits are very narrowly covered. Another major policy
   barrier is that interstate telehealth requires multiple state licenses
   for the physician, who must be licensed in the jurisdiction of each
   patient as well as the provider's physical locations. As Medicare shifts
   toward capitated payment and other value-based methods, there are
   opportunities to remove such restrictions.
   Despite these challenges, some states have been proactive in
   implementing telehealth systems. Arkansas is one of these states, and
   being a rural state with 2 main population centers, specialty care is
   relatively sparse. Implemented in 2014, the hand trauma program has been
   a partnership between the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
   (UAMS) and the Arkansas Trauma Communications Center (ATCC). This
   program has been very successful in decreasing the rate of hand trauma
   transfer, allowing patients to be treated closer to home while having
   coordinated access to fellowship-trained hand surgeons when necessary.
   More widespread innovation of orthopaedic applications for telehealth
   requires physician buy-in and health-systems partnerships. The
   regulatory environment will need streamlining. Ultimately, consumer
   demand will drive the implementation of technology to make care more
   accessible, convenient, and cost-effective.}},

Abstract = {{Background Tight and personalised control of inflammatory bowel disease
   in a traditional setting is challenging because of the disease
   complexity, high pressure on outpatient clinics, and rising incidence.
   We compared the effects of self-management with a telemedicine system,
   which was developed for all subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease, on
   health-care utilisation and patient-reported quality of care versus
   standard care.
   Methods We did this pragmatic, randomised trial in two academic and two
   non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Outpatients aged 18-75 years
   with inflammatory bowel disease and without an ileoanal or ileorectal
   pouch anastomosis, who had internet access and Dutch proficiency, were
   randomly assigned (1: 1) to care via a telemedicine system (myIBDcoach)
   that monitors and registers disease activity or standard care and
   followed up for 12 months. Randomisation was done with a
   computer-generated sequence and used the minimisation method.
   Participants, health-care providers, and staff who assessed outcome
   measures were not masked to treatment allocation. Primary outcomes were
   the number of outpatient visits and patient-reported quality of care
   (assessed by visual analogue scale score 0-10). Safety endpoints were
   the numbers of flares, corticosteroid courses, hospital admissions,
   emergency visits, and surgeries. Analyses were by intention to treat.
   This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT02173002.
   Findings Between Sept 9, 2014, and May 18, 2015, 909 patients were
   randomly assigned to telemedicine (n=465) or standard care (n=444). At
   12 months, the mean number of outpatient visits to the
   gastroenterologist or nurse was significantly lower in the telemedicine
   group (1.55 {[}SD1.50]) than in the standard care group (2.34 {[}1.64];
   difference -0.79 {[}95\%CI -0.98 to -0.59]; p < 0.0001), as was the mean
   number of hospital admissions (0.05 {[}0.28] vs 0.10 {[}0.43];
   difference -0.05 {[}-0.10 to 0.00]; p=0.046). At 12 months, both groups
   reported high mean patient-reported quality of care scores (8.16
   {[}1.37] in the telemedicine group vs 8.27 {[}1.28] in the standard care
   group; difference 0.10 {[}-0.13 to 0.32]; p=0.411). The mean numbers of
   flares, corticosteroid courses, emergency visits, and surgeries did not
   differ between groups.
   Interpretation Telemedicine was safe and reduced outpatient visits and
   hospital admissions compared with standard care. This self-management
   tool might be useful for reorganising care of inflammatory bowel disease
   towards personalised and value-based health care.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This pilot study was conducted to examine, for the first
   time, the ongoing systems biology research and development projects
   within the laboratories and centers of the U.S. Army Medical Research
   and Materiel Command (USAMRMC). The analysis has provided an
   understanding of the breadth of systems biology activities, resources,
   and collaborations across all USAMRMC subordinate laboratories. Methods:
   The Systems Biology Collaboration Center at USAMRMC issued a survey
   regarding systems biology research projects to the eight U.S.-based
   USAMRMC laboratories and centers in August 2016. This survey included a
   data call worksheet to gather self-identified project and programmatic
   information. The general topics focused on the investigators and their
   projects, on the project's research areas, on omics and other large data
   types being collected and stored, on the analytical or computational
   tools being used, and on identifying intramural (i.e., USAMRMC) and
   extramural collaborations. Results: Among seven of the eight
   laboratories, 62 unique systems biology studies were funded and active
   during the final quarter of fiscal year 2016. Of 29 preselected medical
   Research Task Areas, 20 were associated with these studies, some of
   which were applicable to two or more Research Task Areas. Overall,
   studies were categorized among six general types of objectives:
   biological mechanisms of disease, risk of/susceptibility to injury or
   disease, innate mechanisms of healing, diagnostic and prognostic
   biomarkers, and host/patient responses to vaccines, and therapeutic
   strategies including host responses to therapies. We identified eight
   types of omics studies and four types of study subjects. Studies were
   categorized on a scale of increasing complexity from single study
   subject/single omics technology studies (23/62) to studies integrating
   results across two study subject types and two or more omics
   technologies (13/62). Investigators at seven USAMRMC laboratories had
   collaborations with systems biology experts from 18 extramural
   organizations and three other USAMRMC laboratories. Collaborators from
   six USAMRMC laboratories and 58 extramural organizations were identified
   who provided additional research expertise to these systems biology
   studies. Conclusions: At the end of fiscal year 2016, USAMRMC
   laboratories self-reported 66 systems biology/computational biology
   studies (62 of which were unique) with 25 intramural and 81 extramural
   collaborators. Nearly two-thirds were led by or in collaboration with
   the U.S. Army Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research
   Center/Department of Defense Biotechnology High-Performance Computing
   Software Applications Institute and U.S. Army Center for Environmental
   Health Research. The most common study objective addressed biological
   mechanisms of disease. The most common types of Research Task Areas
   addressed infectious diseases (viral and bacterial) and chemical agents
   (environmental toxicant exposures, and traditional and emerging chemical
   threats). More than 40\% of the studies (27/62) involved collaborations
   between the reporting USAMRMC laboratory and one other organization.
   Nearly half of the studies (30/62) involved collaborations between the
   reporting USAMRMC laboratory and at least two other organizations. These
   survey results indicate that USAMRMC laboratories are compliant with
   data-centric policy and guidance documents whose goals are to prevent
   redundancy and promote collaborations by sharing data and leveraging
   capabilities.
   These results also serve as a foundation to make recommendations for
   future systems biology research efforts.}},

   between March and September 2015, were collected via telephone contact
   with the healthcare practitioner who performed the ECG. After
   collection, the data were subjected to statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: Over the study period, 304 patients with cardiovascular
   emergencies were diagnosed within primary care. Only 73.4\% of these
   were recognized by the local physicians. Overall, the most frequent ECG
   abnormalities were acute ischemic patterns (44.7\%) and the frequency of
   such patterns was higher among the ECGs assigned as emergency priority
   (P = 0.03). It was possible to obtain complete information on 231
   patients (75.9\%). Among these, the mean age was 65 +/- 14.4 years,
   57.1\% were men and the most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension
   (68.4\%). In total, 77.9\% were referred to a unit caring for cases of
   higher complexity and 11.7\% of the patients died.
   CONCLUSION: In this study, cardiovascular emergencies were misdiagnosed
   in primary care settings, acute myocardial ischemia was the most
   frequent emergency and the mortality rate was high.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Many adolescents and young adults with chronic illness or
   disability often fail to develop the self-management skills necessary to
   independently handle medical and self-management routines. In light of
   these needs, we are developing iMHere 2.0 (Interactive Mobile Health and
   Rehabilitation), a mobile health (mHealth) system to support a
   self-management program.
   Objective: Our objective was to gather data from persons with brain and
   spinal cord anomalies (BSA) and their caregivers to better understand
   how mHealth would be most helpful in supporting them to proactively
   manage daily self-care routines and to access medical care as needed.
   The specific purpose was not only to gather feedback and to gain
   increased insight into the design of the new version of iMHere, but also
   to gather perspectives of new groups, namely adolescents as young as 12
   years and their parents and/or caregivers.
   Methods: Our project employed focus group sessions and surveys to
   collect data from participants with BSA, as well as their caregivers. A
   total of six focus group sessions were conducted on four separate
   occasions until the data gathered reached saturation. The objectives of
   our focus group sessions were to better understand ways to develop
   mHealth systems to support self-management, to promote independence, to
   motivate long-term system use, and to prevent medical problems that lead
   to hospitalizations and emergency room visits for youth and young adults
   with BSA.
   Results: A total of 16 youth and young adults with BSA and 11 caregivers
   participated in the sessions. Within and among our groups, the following
   five overarching themes emerged from the data: (1) make it easy, (2)
   engage, (3) educate and prepare, (4) motivate and support, and (5)
   personalize. Participants shared their perspectives and detailed
   information about mHealth apps that would be important for independence
   in self-care and self-management.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most individuals keep their
   mobile phones with them at all times and typically use a mobile phone
   for social media, music, photos, and texting. Our qualitative analysis
   indicates that youth and young adults with BSA, as well as their
   caregivers, acknowledge the importance of being actively engaged in
   developing and using mHealth apps that monitor and manage their health
   care needs. Information gleaned from these focus group sessions and
   surveys have provided data to refine the iMHere 2.0 mHealth prototype
   platform that we have developed.}},

Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: In 2013, Alabama required women seeking abortion to have a
   consultation visit followed by a 24-hour waiting period. These
   requirements may adversely affect return for timely care among those
   traveling long distances for services.
   Methods: Using de-identified billing data from two Alabama clinics for
   all abortion encounters in 2013, we calculated the distance traveled
   from women's residential zip code and the number of days between their
   in-person consultation and procedure visits. To assess the associations
   between distance traveled and return for an abortion visit and length of
   interval between visits, we used logistic and ordinal logistic
   regression, respectively.
   Results: Of the 2,730 women attending a consultation visit, 58\%
   traveled less than 25 miles one way to the clinic, 13\% traveled 25 to
   49 miles, 21\% traveled 50 to 100 miles, and 8\% traveled more than 100
   miles. Overall, 19\% of women did not return to either clinic for an
   abortion procedure after their consultation. Distance traveled was not
   associated with return for an abortion visit (odds ratio, 1.04; 95\%
   confidence interval, 0.76-1.42). Among women who returned, 59\% had less
   than 7 days, 29\% had 7 to 13 days, and 12\% had 14 or more days between
   their consultation and procedure visits. Compared with women traveling
   less than 25 miles, those traveling 50 to 100 miles had significantly
   longer intervals between visits (odds ratio, 1.25; 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.01-1.56).
   Conclusions: Although most women returned for their abortion procedure,
   many traveling long distances had a week or more between visits. Because
   delays may limit women's options for affordable abortion care,
   evidence-based policies should be adopted to facilitate women's timely
   receipt of services. (C) 2017 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.

Abstract = {{Telemedicine consultations in remote intensive care units (ICUs)
   overseas were found to be effective in reducing mortality and hospital
   length of stay (LOS). In Australia, there were anecdotal reports of
   these clinical outcomes. This retrospective before and after study
   assessed the improvement in patient outcomes with the implementation of
   a telemedicine program in a regional high dependency unit. Daily virtual
   consultations were conducted between the rural facility and the
   intensivists at the regional centre. A total of 525 patients received
   intensive care support between 2010 and 2015. Hospital and High
   Dependency Unit mortality showed no evidence of significant differences
   between the telemedicine group and the baseline (relative risk 1.02,
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.99-1.06, P=0.25 and relative risk
   1.00, 95\% CI 0.98-1.03, P=0.67 respectively). The hospital LOS was
   lower in the baseline group by 1.5 days. There was no significant
   difference in High Dependency Unit LOS. To adjust for the covariates in
   LOS, log linear regression analysis was performed. The telemedicine
   intervention, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores
   and inter-hospital transfers were found to contribute significantly to
   hospital LOS. The most important result of the study was that the
   proportion of inter-hospital transfers was lower in the telemedicine
   group (relative risk 0.88, 95\% CI 0.80-0.98, P=0.03) compared to
   baseline. This means that critically ill patients in our regional centre
   can continue to receive specialist care remotely through tele-ICU
   consultations thus avoiding the need for patient transport. However,
   further study is needed to establish the benefits and risks of
   telemedicine intervention in ICUs in Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction The aftermath of stroke leaves many consequences including
   cognitive deficits and falls due to imbalance. Stroke survivors and
   families struggle to navigate the complex healthcare system with little
   assistance posthospital discharge, often leading to early hospital
   readmission and worse stroke outcomes. Telemedicine Guided Education on
   Secondary Stroke and Fall Prevention Following Inpatient Rehabilitation
   feasibility study examines whether stroke survivors and their caregivers
   find value in telerehabilitation (TR) home visits that provide
   individualised care and education by a multidisciplinary team after
   discharge from inpatient rehabilitation.
   Methods and analysis A prospective, single arm, pilot study is designed
   to evaluate the feasibility of weekly TR home visits initiated
   postdischarge from inpatient rehabilitation. Newly diagnosed patients
   with stroke are recruited from a Houston-based comprehensive stroke
   centre inpatient rehabilitation unit, loaned an iPad with data plan and
   trained to use information technology security-approved
   videoconferencing application. After hospital discharge, six weekly TR
   home visits are led by rotating specialists (pharmacist,
   physical/occupational therapist, speech therapist, rehabilitation
   physician, social worker, geriatrician specialised in fracture
   prevention) followed by satisfaction survey on week 7. Specialists
   visually assess patients in real time, educate them on secondary stroke
   and fall prevention and suggest ways to improve function including
   direct medical interventions when indicated. Primary outcomes are
   proportion of eligible patients consenting to the study, participation
   rate in all six TR home visits and satisfaction score. The study started
   31 December 2015 with plan to enrol up to 50 patients over 24 months.
   Feasibility study results will inform us as to whether a randomised
   controlled trial is warranted to determine efficacy of TR home visit
   intervention in improving stroke outcomes.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval obtained by the Institutional
   Review Board (IRB), Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, IRB
   number: HSC-MS-14-0994. Study results will be submitted for publication

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We present a new approach for image and video quality evaluation in
   telemedicine applications, relying on the quality assessment of a
   pre-known reduced size logo embedded in an unused part of the medical
   ultrasound frame. The method is tested using two different objective
   metrics, namely: the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the
   Structural SIMilarity index (SSIM). Comparisons with subjective results
   in terms of Differential Mean Opinion Scores (DMOS) are also presented.
   We show that the presented method, not needing the original frame to
   predict the quality, achieves a high correlation with subjective results
   (more than 0.9) for the different quality metrics used. We also present
   relationships between the quality derived via the logo and via the
   original frame and we assess the overhead in data transmission resulting
   from the compressed logo data and its protection overhead. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Objectives: Telemedicine is extensively used in healthcare settings,
   although we still lack knowledge on how to make telemedicine services
   last over time. This study aims to: investigate how the factors
   supporting the implementation of telemedicine services affect their
   duration over time; explore if further factors need to be considered, to
   foster the services duration.
   Methods: We conducted a six-year in-depth study on three Italian cases
   of telemedicine services lasting more than 10 years. Dimensions
   explaining the duration of services over time are explored and discussed
   against existing literature.
   Results: The three cases show that, to support the duration over time,
   financial and organizational stability should be set before the
   ``champion{''} leaves the service. Financial stability was reached
   through different strategies. About organizational stability, we found
   that providing opportunities to enrich the competences and getting more
   responsibilities over the patients enhanced the professionals'
   acceptance, which, in turn, supports the organizational stability of the
   service over time. About patients, to meet their crucial needs for their
   health and to receive the nurses' support on the use of technologies
   contains the abandon and increases the chances for the service to last
   over time. Last, the three services observed pursued a strategy of
   focalization on a specific need.
   Conclusions: The findings provide insights for policy makers and
   hospital managers on how to set effective services and avoid service
   abandon, thus reducing waste of resources, and on how to motivate the
   professionals and patients, by increasing the chances of duration of the
   services over time. (C) 2017 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine.

Abstract = {{Objective: Test the feasibility and clinical outcomes of a home-based
   videoconferencing yoga intervention in participants diagnosed with both
   Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF).
   Background: Yoga has potential benefit for symptom relief in
   participants with COPD and with HF; however, functional impairment and
   transportation issues can hinder access to typical yoga classes.
   Methods: A controlled, nonrandomized trial was conducted of an 8-week
   TeleYoga intervention versus an educational control (information
   leaflets mailed to participants with one weekly phone call). One-hour
   TeleYoga classes were implemented twice weekly via multipoint
   videoconferencing, which connected participants to live classes via an
   Internet connection to their televisions.
   Results: Fourteen participants with COPD and HF took part in the pilot
   study (7 in the intervention group and 8 in the control). Intervention
   participants were adherent to classes, able to safely participate, and
   found the classes enjoyable after the 8-week program. Dyspnea after
   exercise improved in the intervention group.
   Conclusions: Despite their frailty, patients diagnosed with both COPD
   and HF were able to perform yoga safely in the home setting. TeleYoga
   was acceptable and adherence was good; however, technical issues were an
   important hindrance to participation.}},

Title = {{Prescribing of Electronic Activity Monitors in Cardiometabolic Diseases:
   Qualitative Interview-Based Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: The prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, including those
   such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension,
   so-called cardiometabolic diseases, is high and is increasing worldwide.
   Strong evidence supports the role of physical activity in management of
   these diseases. There is general consensus that mHealth technology,
   including electronic activity monitors, can potentially increase
   physical activity in patients, but their use in clinical settings
   remains limited. Practitioners' requirements when prescribing electronic
   activity monitors have been poorly described.
   Objective: The aims of this qualitative study were (1) to explore how
   specialist physicians prescribe electronic activity monitors to patients
   presenting with cardiometabolic conditions, and (2) to better understand
   their motivation for and barriers to prescribing such monitors.
   Methods: We conducted qualitative semistructured interviews in March to
   May 2016 with 11 senior physicians from a public university hospital in
   France with expertise in management of cardiometabolic diseases (type 1
   and type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia).
   Interviews lasted 45 to 60 minutes and were audiotaped, transcribed
   verbatim, and analyzed using directed content analysis. We report our
   findings following the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative
   Research (COREQ) checklist.
   Results: Most physicians we interviewed had never prescribed electronic
   activity monitors, whereas they frequently prescribed blood glucose or
   blood pressure self-monitoring devices. Reasons for nonprescription
   included lack of interest in the data collected, lack of evidence for
   data accuracy, concern about work overload possibly resulting from
   automatic data transfer, and risk of patients becoming addicted to data.
   Physicians expected future marketing of easy-to-use monitors that will
   accurately measure physical activity duration and intensity and provide
   understandable motivating feedback.
   Conclusions: Features of electronic activity monitors, although popular
   among the general public, do not meet the needs of physicians. In-depth
   understanding of physicians' expectations is a first step toward
   designing technologies that can be widely used in clinical settings and
   facilitate physical activity prescription. Physicians should have a
   role, along with key health care stakeholders-patients, researchers,
   information technology firms, the public, and private payers-in
   developing the most effective methods for integrating activity monitors
   into patient care.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of Telemonitoring in Obstetrics: Scoping Review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Despite reported positive results of telemonitoring
   effectiveness in various health care domains, this new technology is
   rarely used in prenatal care. A few isolated investigations were
   performed in the past years but with conflicting results.
   Objective: The aim of this review was to (1) assess whether
   telemonitoring adds any substantial benefit to this patient population
   and (2) identify research gaps in this area to suggest goals for future
   research.
   Methods: This review includes studies exploring the effectiveness of
   telemonitoring interventions for pregnant women reported in the English
   language. Due to the paucity of research in this area, all reports
   including uncontrolled nonrandomized and randomized controlled studies
   were selected.
   Results: Fourteen studies, which performed their data collection from
   1988 to 2010, met the inclusion criteria and were published from 1995 to
   present; four of the 14 published papers were multicenter randomized
   controlled trials (RCTs), five papers were single-center RCTs, three
   papers were retrospective studies, one paper was an observational study,
   and one paper was a qualitative study. Of the 14 papers, nine were
   available for a risk of bias assessment: three papers were classified as
   low risk, one as medium risk, and five as high risk. Furthermore, of
   those 14 papers, 13 focused on telemonitoring for maternal outcomes, and
   nine of the 14 papers focused on telemonitoring for fetal or neonatal
   outcomes. The studies reviewed report that telemonitoring can contribute
   to significant reductions in health care costs, (unscheduled)
   face-to-face visits, low neonatal birth weight, and admissions to the
   neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), as well as prolonged gestational
   age and improved feelings of maternal satisfaction when compared with a
   control group. When only studies with low risk of bias were taken into
   account, the added value of telemonitoring became less pronounced: the
   only added value of telemonitoring is for pregnant women who transmitted
   their uterine activity by telecommunication. They had significant
   prolonged pregnancy survivals, and the newborns were less likely to be
   of low birth weight or to be admitted to the NICU. Following these
   results, telemonitoring can only be recommended by pregnant women at
   risk for preterm delivery. It is however important to consider that
   these studies were published in the mid-90s, which limits their direct
   applicability given the current technologies and practice.
   Conclusions: This review shows that telemonitoring can be tentatively
   recommended for pregnant women at risk for preterm delivery. More recent
   RCTs with a blinded protocol are needed to strengthen the level of
   evidence around this topic and to have an insight in the added value of
   the technologies that are available nowadays. In addition, studies
   investigating patient satisfaction and economic effects in relation to
   telemonitoring are suggested for future research.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo determine whether geriatric triage decisions made using a
   comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) performed online are less
   reliable than face-to-face (FTF) decisions.
   DesignMultisite noninferiority prospective cohort study. Two specialist
   geriatricians assessed individuals sequentially referred for an acute
   care geriatric consultation. Participants were allocated to one FTF
   assessment and an additional assessment (FTF or online (OL)), creating
   two groupstwo FTF (FTF-FTF, n=81) or online and FTF (OL-FTF, n=85).
   SettingThree acute care public hospitals in two Australian states.
   ParticipantsAdmitted individuals referred for CGA.
   InterventionNurse-administered CGA, based on the interRAI Acute Care
   assessment system accessed online and other online clinical data such as
   pathology results and imaging enabling geriatricians to review
   participants' information and provide input into their care from a
   distance.
   MeasurementsThe primary decision subjected to this analysis was referral
   for permanent residential care. Geriatricians also recorded
   recommendations for referrals and variations for medication management
   and judgment regarding prognosis at discharge and after 3months.
   ResultsOverall percentage agreement was 88\% (n=71) for the FTF-FTF
   group and 91\% (n=77) for the OL-FTF group. The difference in agreement
   between the FTF-FTF and OL-FTF groups was -3\%, indicating that there
   was no difference between the methods of assessment. Judgements made
   regarding diagnoses of geriatric syndromes, medication management, and
   prognosis (with regard to hospital outcome and location at 3months) were
   found to be equally reliable in each mode of consultation.
   ConclusionGeriatric assessment performed online using a
   nurse-administered structured CGA system was no less reliable than
   conventional assessment in making clinical triage decisions.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) recipients
   require close follow-up that can be difficult for patients who have to
   travel long distances for clinic follow-up. We aimed to compare clinical
   outcomes between ICD patients followed-up in a telemedicine
   video-conferencing clinic (TMVC) and a conventional in-person clinic
   (CIC). We hypothesized that outcomes of patients followed in the TMVC
   are noninferior to the CIC.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective study compares time to first
   appropriate ICD therapy, time to first inappropriate ICD therapy, time
   to first shock, and overall survival in patients followed in TMVC
   compared with CIC between 2001 and 2016. Two hundred and eighty-seven
   patients were followed in the TMVC group and 236 patients in the CIC.
   The average age of the TMVC and CIC groups was 64.13 +/- 9.38 and 65.23
   +/- 8.57 years, respectively (P=0.164). There was no difference in the
   modified Seattle heart failure model score between the 2 groups (-0.12
   +/- 1.0 versus -0.21 +/- 0.99; P=0.287). The Charlson comorbidity index
   score was higher in the CIC group compared with the TMVC group (7.0
   versus 6.0; P= 0.01). Mean duration of follow-up was 4.8 years. Adjusted
   and unadjusted tests of noninferiority found TMVC was not inferior to
   in-person follow-up for the prespecified outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Video-conferencing ICD follow-up for patients in areas
   where electrophysiology subspecialty care is not available leads to
   outcomes that are noninferior to CIC follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To report the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and
   DR-related blindness in an Indonesian population with type 2 diabetes.
   METHODS: DESIGN: Population-based cross-sectional study. SETTING:
   Community health centers. STUDY POPULATION: We recruited 1184 people
   aged older than 30 years with type 2 diabetes residing in Jogjakarta,
   Indonesia. Multistage, clustered random sampling based on regencies and
   districts in Jogjakarta was used. OBSERVATION PROCEDURE: Detailed
   interviews, general and eye examinations, and anthropometric measurement
   were performed. Disc- and macula-centered retinal photographs were taken
   to assess DR. The definition of DR followed a modified Airlie House
   classification system and was categorized into mild, moderate, and
   vision threatening DR (VTDR). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Prevalence and
   severity of DR.
   RESULTS: The median (range) age and diabetes duration of participants
   was 59 (52-65) and 4 (2-9) years. The prevalence of DR was 43.1\% (95\%
   confidence interval 39.6\%-46.6\%), with mild, moderate, and severe NPDR
   and PDR to be 9.41\%, 7.46\%, 11.1\%, and 12.1\%, respectively. The
   prevalence of VTDR was 26.3\% (23.1\%-29.5\%). Longer diabetes duration,
   higher fasting glucose, presence of hypertension, and foot ulcers were
   associated with DR and VTDR. The prevalence of bilateral blindness was
   4\% and 7.7\% in persons with DR and VTDR.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a high prevalence of any DR and VTDR
   among Indonesian adults with type 2 diabetes in urban and rural areas:
   approximately 1 in 4 adults with diabetes had VTDR and 1 in 12 of those
   with VTDR was bilaterally blind, suggesting the need for appropriate
   screening and management of DR among the Indonesian population. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To describe methodology and screening results from the
   Philadelphia Telemedicine Glaucoma Detection and Follow-up Study.
   DESIGN: Screening program results for a prospective randomized clinical
   trial.
   METHODS: Individuals were recruited who were African-American,
   Hispanic/Latino, or Asian over age 40 years; white individuals over age
   65 years; and any ethnicity over age 40 years with a family history of
   glaucoma or diabetes. Primary care offices and Federally Qualified
   Health Centers were used for telemedicine (Visit 1). Two posterior
   fundus photographs and 1 anterior segment photograph were captured per
   eye in each participant, using a nonmydriatic, autofocus, hand-held
   fundus camera (Volk Optical, Mentor, Ohio, USA). Medical and ocular
   history, family history of glaucoma, visual acuity, and intraocular
   pressure measurements using the ICare rebound tonometer (ICare,
   Helsinki, Finland) were obtained. Images were read remotely by a trained
   retina reader and a glaucoma specialist.
   RESULTS: From April 1, 2015, to February 6, 2017, 906 individuals
   consented and attended Visit 1. Of these, 553 participants were female
   (61.0\%) and 550 were African-American (60.7\%), with a mean age of 58.7
   years. A total of 532 (58.7\%) participants had diabetes, and 616 (68\%)
   had a history of hypertension. During Visit 1, 356 (39.3\%) participants
   were graded with a normal image. Using image data from the worse eye,
   333 (36.8\%) were abnormal and 155 (17.1\%) were unreadable. A total of
   258 (28.5\%) had a suspicious nerve, 62 (6.8\%) had ocular hypertension,
   102 (11.3\%) had diabetic retinopathy, and 68 (7.5\%) had other retinal
   abnormalities.
   CONCLUSION: An integrated telemedicine screening intervention in primary
   care offices and Federally Qualified Health Centers detected high rate
   of suspicious optic nerves, ocular hypertension, and retinal pathology.

Abstract = {{Drones are pilotless aircrafts that were initially used exclusively by
   the military but are now also used for various scientific purposes,
   public safety, and in commercial industries. The healthcare industry in
   particular can benefit from their technical capabilities and ease of
   use. Common drone applications in medicine include the provision
   disaster assessments when other means of access are severely restricted;
   delivering aid packages, medicines, vaccines, blood and other medical
   supplies to remote areas; providing safe transport of disease test
   samples and test kits in areas with high contagion; and potential for
   providing rapid access to automated external defibrillators for patients
   in cardiac arrest. Drones are also showing early potential to benefit
   geriatric medicine by providing mobility assistance to elderly
   populations using robot-like technology. Looking further to the future,
   drones with diagnostic imaging capabilities may have a role in assessing
   health in remote communities using telemedicine technology. The Federal
   Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the European
   Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in the European Union are some examples of
   legislative bodies with regulatory authority over drone usage. These
   agencies oversee all technical, safety, security and administrative
   issues related to drones. It is important that drones continue to meet
   or exceed the requirements specified in each of these regulatory areas.
   The FAA is challenged with keeping pace legislatively with the rapid
   advances in drone technology. This relative lag has been perceived as
   slowing the proliferation of drone use. Despite these regulatory
   limitations, drones are showing significant potential for transforming
   healthcare and medicine in the 21st century.}},

Title = {{Novel Methodology for Triage and Prioritizing Using ``Big Data{''}
   Patients with Chronic Heart Diseases Through Telemedicine Environmental}},

Abstract = {{Problem Statement: Improper triage and prioritization of big-data
   patients may result in erroneous strategic decisions. An example of such
   wrong decision making includes the triage of patients with chronic heart
   disease to low-priority groups. Incorrect decisions may jeopardize the
   patients' health.
   Objective: This study aims to evaluate and score the big data of
   patients with chronic heart disease and of those who require urgent
   attention. The assessment is based on multicriteria decision making in a
   telemedical environment to improve the triage and prioritization
   processes.
   Methods: A hands-on study was performed. A total of 500 patients with
   chronic heart disease manifested in direrent symptoms and under various
   emergency levels were evaluated on the basis of the following four main
   measures. An electrocardiogram sensor was used to measure the electrical
   signals of the contractile activity of the heart over time. A SpO(2)
   sensor was employed to determine the blood oxygen saturation levels of
   the patients. A blood pressure sensor was used to obtain the
   physiological data of the systolic and diastolic blood pressures of the
   patients. Finally, a non-sensory measurement ( text frame) was conducted
   to assess chest pain and breathing. The patients were prioritized on the
   basis of a set of measurements by utilizing integrated back-forward
   adjustment for weight computation and technique for order performance by
   similarity to ideal solution.
   Discussion Results: Patients with the most urgent cases were given the
   highest priority level, whereas those with the least urgent cases were
   assigned with the lowest priority level among all patients' scores. The
   first three patients assigned to the medical committee of doctors were
   proven to be the most critical emergency cases with the highest priority
   level on the basis of their clinical symptoms. By contrast, the last
   three patients were proven to be the least critical emergency cases and
   given the lowest priority levels relative to other patients. The
   throughput measurement in terms of scalability based on our proposed
   algorithm was more efficient than that of the benchmark algorithm.
   Finally, the new method for determining the ``big data{''} patients
   characteristics based on ``4Vs{''} was suggested.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: The number of eHealth interventions in the management of
   chronic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) is growing. Despite
   promising results, the implementation and use of these interventions is
   limited.
   Objectives: This study aimed to assess opinions of the most important
   stakeholders influencing the implementation and use of eHealth services
   in daily dermatology practice.
   Methods: The perspectives of health care professionals and patients
   towards the implementation and use of eHealth services in daily practice
   were assessed by using a mixed method design. A cross-sectional survey
   based on the eHealth implementation toolkit (eHit) was conducted to
   explore factors influencing the adoption of eHealth interventions
   offering the possibility of e-consultations, Web-based monitoring, and
   Web-based self-management training among dermatologists and dermatology
   nurses. The perspectives of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD)
   regarding the use of eHealth services were discussed in an online focus
   group.
   Results: Health care professionals (n=99) and patients (n=9)
   acknowledged the value of eHealth services and were willing to use these
   digital tools in daily dermatology practice. Key identified barriers
   (statements with <50\% of the participants scoring totally agree or
   agree) in the implementation and adoption of eHealth interventions
   included concerns about the availability (12/99, 12\%) and allocation
   (14/99, 14\%) of resources, financial aspects (26/99, 26\%),
   reliability, security, and confidentially of the intervention itself
   (29/99, 29\%), and the lack of education and training (6/99, 6\%).
   Conclusions: Health care professionals and patients acknowledge the
   benefits arising from the implementation and use of eHealth services in
   daily dermatology practice. However, some important barriers were
   identified that might be useful in addressing the implementation
   strategy in order to enhance the implementation success of eHealth
   interventions in dermatology.}},

Title = {{A Systematic Review of the Implementation Challenges of Telemedicine

Abstract = {{Background: Telemedicine systems are gaining attention nationwide as a
   means for providing care in remote areas and allowing a small number of
   providers to impact a large geographic region. We systematically
   reviewed the literature to identify the efficacy and implementation
   challenges of tele-medicine systems in ambulances.
   Methods: A search for published studies on Web of Science and PubMed was
   completed. Studies were selected if they included at least a pilot study
   and they focused on feasibility or implementation of tele-medicine
   systems in ambulances.
   Results: A total of 864 articles were used for title and abstract
   screening. Full text screening was completed for 102 articles, with 23
   being selected for final review. Sixty-one percent of the studies
   included in the review focused on general emergency care, while 26\%
   focused on stroke care and 13\% focused on myocardial infarction care.
   The reviewed studies found that telemedicine is feasible and effective
   in decreasing treatment times, report a high diagnosis accuracy rate,
   show higher rates of positive task completion than in regular
   ambulances, and demonstrate that stroke evaluation is completed with
   comparable accuracy to the standard way of delivering care.
   Conclusions: Although this review identified life-saving benefits of
   telemedicine, it also showed the paucity of the scientifically sound
   research in its implementation, prompting further studies. Further
   research is needed to analyze the capabilities and challenges involved
   in implementing telemedicine in ambulances, especially studies focusing
   on human-system integration and human factors' considerations in the
   implementation of telemedicine systems in ambulances, the development of
   advanced Internet connectivity paradigms, additional applications for
   triaging, and the implications of ambulance location.}},

Title = {{Bedside Critical Care Staff Use of Intensive Care Unit Telemedicine:
   Comparisons by Intensive Care Unit Complexity}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Effects of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) telemedicine on patient
   and staff outcomes are mixed. Variation in utilization is potentially
   driving these differences. Introduction: ICU telemedicine utilization is
   understudied, with existing research focusing on telemedicine staff. We
   assess ICU telemedicine utilization from the perspective of the end
   user-ICU staff-to better understand how telemedicine use is
   conceptualized and practiced at the bedside.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted a thematic content analysis of
   semistructured interviews with bedside ICU staff. Staff were interviewed
   at seven ICUs in six Veterans Health Administration facilities,
   representing varying ICU complexities and points in time (2 and 12
   months postimplementation of ICU telemedicine).
   Results: Fifty-eight bedside ICU staff described instances of
   telemedicine use, which were categorized into three types: Urgent ICU
   Patient Care, Clinical Decision-Making and Support, and General ICU
   Patient Care. The most commonly described use was General ICU Patient
   Care and the least common was Urgent ICU Patient Care. ICU staff from
   lower complexity ICUs had fewer descriptions of use compared to staff at
   higher complexity ICUs. At 12 months postimplementation, staff recounted
   more instances of all three utilization types.
   Discussion: It is important to understand how telemedicine is being used
   within ICUs to evaluate its impact. The presence of three types of use,
   variability in use by ICU complexity, and change in use over time
   suggest the need for comprehensive measures of utilization to evaluate
   effectiveness.
   Conclusions: ICU telemedicine needs to develop an agreed upon typology
   for documenting ICU telemedicine utilization and incorporate these
   measures into models of its effect on clinical outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic disease requiring
   regular follow-up. To increase access to dermatological care, online
   management of AD is being studied. However, a critical knowledge gap
   exists in determining AD patients' quality of life in direct-to-patient
   online models. In this study, we examined quality of life in AD patients
   managed through a direct-access online model.
   Materials and Methods: We randomized 156 patients to receiving care
   through a direct-access online platform or in person. Patients were seen
   for six visits over 12 months. At each visit, the patients completed
   Dermatology Life Quality Index/Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index
   (DLQI/CDLQI), and Short Form (SF-12).
   Results: Between baseline and 12 months, the mean (standard deviation,
   SD) within-group difference in DLQI score in the online group was 4.1
   (+/- 2.3); for the in-person group, the within-group difference was 4.8
   (+/- 2.7). The mean (SD) within-group difference in CDLQI score in the
   online group was 4.7 (+/- 2.8); for the inperson group, the within-group
   difference was 4.9 (+/- 3.1). The mean (SD) within-group difference in
   physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS) SF-12
   scores in the online group was 6.5 (+/- 3.8) and 8.6 (+/- 4.3); for the
   in-person group, it was 6.8 (+/- 3.2) and 9.1(+/- 3.8), respectively.
   The difference in the change in DLQI, CDLQI, SF-12 PCS, and SF-12 MCS
   scores between the two groups was 0.72 (95\% confidence interval {[}
   90\% CI], -0.97 to 2.41), 0.23 (90\% CI, -2.21 to 2.67), 0.34 (90\% CI,
   -1.16 to 1.84), and 0.51 (90\% CI, -1.11 to 2.13), respectively. All
   differences were contained within their equivalence margins.
   Conclusion: Adult and pediatric AD patients receiving directaccess
   online care had equivalent quality of life outcomes as those see in
   person. The direct-access online model has the potential to increase
   access to care for patients with chronic skin diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In 2015, India had an estimated 69.2 million people with
   diabetes and a national prevalence of 8.7\%. Evidence is mounting for
   the benefits of telemedicine in diabetes care, but remains limited on
   mobile-health (m-Health) interventions. Introduction: This study
   assessed the impact of an m-Health diabetes platform on clinical
   outcomes, patient-reported outcomes, patient and provider satisfaction,
   and app usage.
   Materials and Methods: This open-label, two-arm parallel study enrolled
   91 people at 3 sites in India, aged 18-65, with type 2 diabetes, and an
   A1c between 7.5\% and 12.5\% (58113 mmol/mol). Participants were
   randomly assigned 1: 1 to m-Health or usual care and observed for 6
   months. All received free visits, laboratory tests, transportation fees,
   and strips and lancets. Intervention participants received the m-Health
   app and a mobile phone data stipend.
   Results: A1c change was previously reported as statistically
   significant. Significantly more participants in intervention than
   control had improved medication adherence (39.0\% vs. 12.8\%; p = 0.03)
   and increased frequency of blood glucose (BG) self-testing (39.0\% vs.
   10.3\%; p = 0.01) at 6 months from baseline. No other outcomes were
   significantly different. Among m-Health users, 75\% of participants
   actively used the app at week 24. Participants entered 29,668
   medications and 2,575 BG readings, sent 497 messages, and received 890
   messages. Most participants (80\%) were satisfied with all aspects of
   the app and all seven providers rated the software very acceptable.
   Discussion: Participants assigned to m-Health had increased medication
   adherence and frequency of BG testing compared with usual care
   participants.
   Conclusions: This tool could be an effective way to expand access to
   quality chronic disease care and improve outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: With the introduction of online health screenings,
   guidelines describing how to communicate about a person's health need to
   be adapted for a digital setting. This study aimed to uncover older
   adults' preferences regarding such online messages.
   Materials and Methods: Thirty older adults (aged 65 to 75 years) viewed
   four versions of the results message of a screening aimed at identifying
   frailty: a standard, empathic, tailored, or both empathic and tailored
   message. After each version, they were interviewed about what they
   (dis)liked about the message. They also ranked the four versions
   according to preference. Ranks were analyzed with a Friedman's test and
   a Wilcoxon's signed-rank test.
   Results: There was no significant difference for message-type preference
   when the outcome was positive. For the prefrail or frail outcome,
   message-type preferences differed (chi(2) = 10.51, p = 0.02 and chi(2) =
   13.56, p < 0.01, respectively). Overall, for the prefrail and frail
   outcome, the tailored version was appreciated most. Participants
   commented that the tailored version made them feel appreciated more as a
   person. Some found the empathic additions comforting, others found these
   unnecessary.
   Conclusions: When communicating the results of an online health
   screening to older adults via the Internet, one should primarily tailor
   the message toward personal characteristics. The effect of empathic
   elements in results messages appeared to be limited. Whether a message
   should be adapted depends on whether the outcome is positive or
   negative.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Hearing loss (HL) affects people worldwide, many of whom
   are children. Especially in developing countries, epidemiological data
   on the prevalence of HL are insufficient to implement effective health
   promotion programs. In this preliminary study with young adults, we
   describe and validate a tablet-based hearing screening test developed
   for interactive remote hearing screening and compare the performance of
   an audiometry screening tablet application with conventional audiometry.
   In addition, the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the
   tablet-based method and the concordance between the two methods were
   analyzed.
   Methods: Thirty volunteers participated in a double-blind study
   assessing two auditory threshold screening methods: tablet-based hearing
   screening and sweep audiometry. For both methods, a correct response to
   a minimum of two tones out of three emitted at 20 dBHL for the
   frequencies of 1, 2, and 4 kHz and 30 dBHL for 0.5 kHz in both ears, was
   considered a negative screening result (normal hearing), whereas hearing
   impairment was considered a positive screening result.
   Results: According to both methods, 26 participants had normal hearing
   and four had HL. The Kappa coefficient indicated perfect concordance
   between methods. The tablet-based hearing screening method had a
   sensitivity of 100\% (confidence interval {[}CI]: 30.5-100.0), a
   specificity of 100\% (CI: 87.1-100.0), a positive predictive value of
   100\% (CI: 30.5-100.0), and a negative predictive value of 100\% (CI:
   87.1-100.0).
   Conclusions: The tablet-based hearing screening test was shown to be a
   reliable and an accurate method for hearing screening that can be used
   effectively in places with Internet access and where local audiologists
   are not available.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This article proposes a novel, cost-effective, flexible,
   and easy-to-deploy wireless teleophthalmology network architecture and
   performance evaluation for its potential use in remote areas. This study
   has used practical telecommunication standards, which is widely deployed
   throughout India.
   Methods: In the proposed scenario, patient's eye images are obtained
   using a specified imaging modality, and then sent to a server at the
   primary eye care centre (PECC) using ZigBee a short-range wireless
   network. It is linked to the main server at the base eye hospital (BEH)
   through a GSM/UMTS (3G)/WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave
   Access) network. After diagnostic evaluation of the eye image using
   various automated diagnostic software, data are sent to a physician in
   an urban center for further validation, which is connected through
   GSM/UMTS (3G)/WiMAX network. Performance evaluation of these wireless
   networks is carried out for their use in teleophthalmology application
   based on network parameters, namely throughput, average end-to-end
   delay, and average jitter. It is found that end-to-end delay is the most
   critical network parameter affecting overall quality of service (QoS) of
   the proposed teleophthalmology network.
   Results and Conclusions: The results demonstrate that WiMAX is the most
   suitable network among the considered networks for connecting PECC nodes
   with BEH main server, and further connecting main server with a doctor
   on the move. It is also deduced that for a given set of QoS parameters,
   WiMAX supports a load capacity of 22,000 packets at center nodes and the
   main server and it performs well even when the mobility speed of doctor
   exceeds 200 KPH.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine if mobile videoconferencing technology can
   facilitate the discharge of low-acuity patients receiving in-home care
   without compromising short-term health outcomes.
   Methods: A 6-month trial commenced in July 2015 with 345 patients
   considered unsuited to Criteria Led Discharge (CLD) receiving in-home
   care included as participants. Nurses providing clinical support to
   patients in their homes were supplied with a tablet computer (Apple
   iPad) with Internet connectivity (Telstra 4G Network) and
   videoconferencing software (Cisco Jabber for Telepresence). Device usage
   data combined with hospital admission records were collected to
   determine (a) instances where a telemedicine-facilitated discharge
   occurred and (b) if the accepted measure of short-term health outcomes
   (readmission within 28 days) was adversely affected by this alternative
   method.
   Results: Telemedicine technology facilitated the discharge of 10.1\% (n
   = 35) of patients considered unsuitable for CLD from the Hospital in the
   Home model during the trial period. Statistically insignificant
   differences in rates of readmission between patients discharged in
   person versus those participating in the telemedicine-supported model
   suggest that the clinical standards of the service have been maintained.
   Conclusion: The results of evaluating telemedicine support for nurses
   providing low-acuity in-home care indicate that patients may be
   discharged remotely while maintaining the existing clinical standards of
   the service.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The smartphone simplifies interprofessional communication,
   and smartphone applications can facilitate telemedicine activity. Much
   has been written about the steps that need to be followed to implement
   and establish a successful telemedicine service that is integrated into
   everyday clinical practice. A traditional and systematic approach has
   evolved incorporating activities such as strategy development, needs
   assessment, business cases and plans, readiness assessment,
   implementation plans, change management interventions, and
   ongoingmonitoring and evaluation. This ``best practice'' has been
   promoted in the telehealth literature for many years. In contrast,
   several recent initiatives have arisen without any such formal
   undertakings. This articledescribes the strengths andweaknesses of two
   ``spontaneous'' telemedicine services in dermatology and burn management
   that have evolved in South Africa.
   Methods: Two spontaneous services were identified and reviewed.
   Results: In one unsolicited service, doctors at rural referring
   hospitals have been taking photographs of skin lesions and sending them
   with a brief text message history to dermatologists using the instant
   messaging smartphone app, WhatsApp. In the other, burns service,
   admissions to the burns unit or the clinic were triaged by telephonic
   description of the case and completion of a preadmission questionnaire.
   More recently, management and referral decisions are made only after
   completion of the questionnaire and subsequent submission of photographs
   of the burn sent by WhatsApp, with the decision transmitted by text
   message.
   Discussion: Although efficient and effective, potential legal and
   ethical shortcomings have been identified. Conclusion: These
   ``spontaneous'' telehealth services challenge traditional best practice,
   yet appear to lead to truly integrated practice and, therefore, are
   successful and warrant further study.}},

Abstract = {{Burns are devastating to the individual and society, representing a huge
   biomedical burden. Improved education in burns has however ignited a
   revolution in high-income countriesburn mortality is reducing. Education
   in burns is far-reaching. For the purpose of this concise review, we
   focus on four categories: education of both (1) emergency and (2)
   specialist physicians, and the general population, both at a (3)
   societal and (4) individual level. Tragically, the global burns picture
   is bleak with burns representing a neglected but solvable health crisis.
   Ninety-five percent of burns occur in low-income countries, causing
   enormous suffering, death and disability. Here, we examine the
   literature detailing burn education with a focus on past lessons,
   current trends and future objectives. We have identified key educational
   objectives to revolutionise burn care on a global perspective. Now is
   the time to build on promising educational strides to reduce the global

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study is to review our experience
   incorporating Interactive Home Telehealth (IHT) visits into follow-up
   burn care.
   Methods: A retrospective review of all burn patients participating in
   IHT encounters over the course of 15 months was performed. Connections
   were established through secure video conferencing and call-routing
   software. Patients connected with a personal computer or tablet and
   providers connected with a desktop computer with a high-definition web
   camera. In some cases, high-definition digital images were emailed to
   the provider prior to the virtual consultation. For each patient, the
   following was collected: (1) patient and injury demographics (diagnosis,
   prognosis, and clinical management), (2) total number of encounters, (3)
   service for each encounter (burn, psychiatry, and rehabilitation), (4)
   length of visit, including travel distance and time saved and, (5)
   complications, including readmissions and connectivity issues.
   Results: 52 virtual encounters were performed with 31 patients during
   the first year of the pilot project from March 2015 to June 2016. Mean
   age of the participant was 44 years (range 18-83 years).
   Meantotalburnsurfaceareaoftheparticipantwas12\%(range1-80\%).
   Averageroundtrip travel distance saved was 188 miles (range 4-822
   miles). Average round trip travel time saved was201min(range20-564min).
   There were no unplanned re-admissions and no complications. Five
   connectivity issues were reported, none of which prevented completion of
   the visit.
   Conclusions: Interactive Home Telehealth is a safe and feasible modality
   for delivering follow-up care to burn patients. Burn care providers
   benefit from the potential to improve outpatient clinic utilization.
   Patients benefit from improved access to multiple members of their
   specialized burn care team, as well as cost-reductions for patient
   travel expenses. Future studies are needed to ensure patient and
   provider satisfaction and to further validate the significance,

Abstract = {{Objective: This pilot study explored the feasibility and preliminary
   efficacy of a therapist-facilitated telecare cognitive behavioural
   anxiety program delivered through schools to children within rural
   communities. Method: Sixteen children aged 9-12 years (82.5\% male),
   with a principal diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and their mothers
   participated in the pilot study. The treatment program was an adaption
   of the Cool Kids Child and Adolescent Anxiety Management Program.
   Treatment was delivered by clinical psychologists and involved 10 weekly
   sessions with children via an interactive, real-time videoconferencing
   online platform at their school. Parents also received 4 phone calls
   during the treatment program. Outcome measures included clinician-rated
   diagnostic status and child- and parent-reported symptoms and
   interference. Results: According to combined parent and child reports,
   62.5\% of children no longer met diagnostic criteria for their primary
   anxiety disorder, and 31.25\% did not meet diagnostic criteria for any
   anxiety disorder post-treatment. Results indicated that the severity of
   anxiety symptoms, functional impact of anxiety symptoms, externalising
   difficulties, and depressive symptoms in children decreased
   significantly post-treatment, as reported by both parents and children.
   Conclusions: A telecare model of therapy could be a feasible and
   effective way of delivering evidence-based intervention to children in
   rural communities.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Telemedicine in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) has the
   potential for delivering timely care to premature infants at risk for
   serious ROP.
   OBJECTIVE To describe the characteristics of eyes at risk for ROP to
   provide insights into what types of ROP are most easily detected early
   by image grading.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Secondary analysis of eyes with
   referral-warranted (RW) ROP (stage 3 ROP, zone I ROP, plus disease) on
   diagnostic examination from the Telemedicine Approaches to Evaluating
   Acute-Phase Retinopathy of Prematurity (e-ROP) study was conducted from
   May 1, 2011, to October 31, 2013, in 1257 premature infants with birth
   weights less than 1251 g in 13 neonatal units in North America. Data
   analysis was performed between February 1, 2016, and June 5, 2017.
   INTERVENTIONS Serial imaging sessions with concurrent diagnostic
   examinations for ROP.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Time of detecting RW-ROP on image evaluation
   compared with clinical examination.
   RESULTS In the e-ROP study, 246 infants (492 eyes) were included in the
   analysis; 138 (56.1\%) were male. A total of 447 eyes had RW-ROP on
   diagnostic examination. Image grading in 123 infants (mean {[}SD]
   gestational age, 24.8 {[}1.4] weeks) detected RW-ROP earlier than
   diagnostic examination (early) in 191 (42.7\%) eyes by about 15 days and
   detected RW-ROP in 123 infants (mean {[}SD] gestational age, 24.6
   {[}1.5] weeks) at the same time (same) in 200 (44.7\%) eyes. Most of the
   early eyes (153 {[}80.1\%]) interpreted as being RW-ROP positive on
   imaging evaluation agreed with examination findings when the examination
   subsequently documented RW-ROP. At the sessions in which RW-ROP was
   first found by examination, stage 3 or more in 123 infants (mean {[}SD]
   gestational age, 24.8 {[}1.4] weeks) ROP was noted earlier on image
   evaluation in 151 of 191 early eyes (79.1\%) and in 172 of 200 of same
   eyes (86.0\%) (P = .08); the presence of zone I ROP was detected in 57
   of 191 (29.8\%) early eyes vs 64 of 200 (32.0\%) same eyes (P = .90);
   and plus disease was noted in 30 of 191 (15.7\%) early eyes and 45 of
   200 (22.5\%) same eyes (P = .08).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In both early and same eyes, zone I and/or
   stage 3 ROP determined a significant proportion of RW-ROP; plus disease
   played a relatively minor role. In most early RW-ROP eyes, the findings
   were consistent with clinical examination and/or image grading at the
   next session. Because ROP telemedicine is used more widely, development
   of standard approaches and protocols is essential.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recently, the number of ambulance dispatches has been
   increasing in Japan, and it is therefore difficult for hospitals to
   accept emergency patients smoothly and appropriately because of the
   limited hospital capacity. To facilitate the process of requesting
   patient transport and hospital acceptance, an emergency information
   system using information technology (IT) has been built and introduced
   in various communities. However, its effectiveness has not been
   thoroughly revealed. We introduced a smartphone app system in 2013 that
   enables emergency medical service (EMS) personnel to share information
   among themselves regarding on-scene ambulances and the hospital
   situation.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of
   introducing this smartphone app on the EMS system in Osaka City, Japan.
   Methods: This retrospective study analyzed the population-based
   ambulance records of Osaka Municipal Fire Department. The study period
   was 6 years, from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015. We enrolled
   emergency patients for whom on-scene EMS personnel conducted hospital
   selection. The main endpoint was the difficulty experienced in gaining
   hospital acceptance at the scene. The definition of difficulty was
   making >= 5 phone calls by EMS personnel at the scene to hospitals until
   a decision to transport was determined. The smartphone app was
   introduced in January 2013, and we compared the patients treated from
   2010 to 2012 (control group) with those treated from 2013 to 2015
   (smartphone app group) using an interrupted time-series analysis to
   assess the effects of introducing this smartphone app.
   Results: A total of 600,526 emergency patients for whom EMS personnel
   selected hospitals were eligible for our analysis. There were 300,131
   emergency patients in the control group (50.00\%, 300,313/600,526) from
   2010 to 2012 and 300,395 emergency patients in the smartphone app group
   (50.00\%, 300,395/600,526) from 2013 to 2015. The rate of difficulty in
   hospital acceptance was 14.19\% (42,585/300,131) in the control group
   and 10.93\% (32,819/300,395) in the smartphone app group. No change over
   time in the number of difficulties in hospital acceptance was found
   before the introduction of the smartphone app (regression coefficient:
   -2.43, 95\% CI -5.49 to 0.64), but after its introduction, the number of
   difficulties in hospital acceptance gradually decreased by month
   (regression coefficient: -11.61, 95\% CI -14.57 to -8.65).
   Conclusions: Sharing information between an ambulance and a hospital by
   using the smartphone app at the scene was associated with decreased
   difficulty in obtaining hospital acceptance. Our app and findings may be
   worth considering in other areas of the world where emergency medical
   information systems with IT are needed.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to assess whether the novel application
   of a machine learning approach to data collected from the Microsoft
   Kinect 2 (MK2) could be used to classify differing levels of upper limb
   impairment. Twenty-four healthy subjects completed items of the Wolf
   Motor Function Test (WMFT), which is a clinically validated metric of
   upper limb function for stroke survivors. Subjects completed the WMFT
   three times: 1) as a healthy individual; 2) emulating mild impairment;
   and 3) emulating moderate impairment. A MK2 was positioned in front of
   participants, and collected kinematic data as they completed the WMFT. A
   classification framework, based on Riemannian geometry and the use of
   covariance matrices as feature representation of the MK2 data, was
   developed for these data, and its ability to successfully classify
   subjects as either ``healthy;{''} ``mildly impaired,{''} or ``
   moderately impaired{''} was assessed. Mean accuracy for our classifier
   was 91.7\%, with a specific accuracy breakdown of 100\%, 83.3\%, and
   91.7\% for the ``healthy,{''} ``mildly impaired,{''} and ``moderately
   impaired{''} conditions, respectively. We conclude that data from the
   MK2 is of sufficient quality to perform objective motor behavior
   classification in individuals with upper limb impairment. The data
   collection and analysis framework that we have developed has the
   potential to disrupt the field of clinical assessment. Future studies
   will focus on validating this protocol on large populations of
   individuals with actual upper limb impairments in order to create a
   toolkit that is clinically validated and available to the clinical
   community.}},

Title = {{An innovative approach to improve ear, nose and throat surgical access

Abstract = {{Introduction: On a background of high rates of severe otitis media (OM)
   with associated hearing loss, children from the Torres Strait and Cape
   York region requiring ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery, faced waiting
   times exceeding three years. After numerous clinical safety incidents
   were raised, indicating a failure of the current system to deliver
   appropriate care, the governing Hospital and Health service opted to
   deliver surgical care through an alternate process. ENT surgeries were
   performed on 16 consented children from two remote locations via the
   private health care system, funded by a health provider partnership.
   Methods: We examined the collaboration processes alongside clinical
   findings from this ENT surgery. Collated patient data, included patient
   demographics, clinical and audiometry presentation features were
   reviewed and compared pre and post-operatively. Cost savings associated
   with the use of TeleHealth post-operatively were briefly examined.
   Results: Surgeries were successfully completed in all 16 children. The
   reported mean waitlist time for ENT surgery was 1.2 years. Pre-surgery
   pure-tone average hearing thresholds were reported at left: 30.9 dB,
   right: 38.2 dB. The majority of presentations were for bilateral OM with
   Effusion (69\%). Post-surgical follow up indicated successful clinical
   outcomes in 80\% of patients and successful hearing outcomes in 88\% of
   patients. Mean difference pure-tone average hearing thresholds, left:
   8.4 dB and right: 11.2 dB. Furthermore, the majority of patients
   reported improved hearing and breathing. The use of TeleHealth for
   post-operative review enabled a minimum cost saving of AUD\$21,664 for
   these 16 children. Overall, a high level of staffing resources was
   required to successfully coordinate this intense surgical activity.
   Conclusion: This innovative approach to a health system crisis enabled
   successful ENT surgical and hearing outcomes in 16 children, whose
   waitlisted time grossly exceeded state health recommendations. Using
   private health facilities funded by a health partnership, while unlikely
   to be a suitable model of care for routine service delivery; may be
   applied as an adjunct service model when blockages and delays lead to
   sub-standard service provision. This approach may be applicable to other
   health care facilities when facing extended elective surgery wait times
   in ENT or other specialty areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: To understand potential utilization of clinical services at a
   rural integrated health care system by generating optimal groups of
   telemedicine locations from electronic health record (EHR) data using
   geographic information systems (GISs).
   Methods: This retrospective study extracted nonidentifiable grouped data
   of patients over a 2-year period from the EHR, including geomasked
   locations. Spatially optimal groupings were created using available
   telemedicine sites by calculating patients' average travel distance
   (ATD) to the closest clinic site.
   Results: A total of 4027 visits by 2049 unique patients were analyzed.
   The best travel distances for site groupings of 3, 4, 5, or 6 site
   locations were ranked based on increasing ATD. Each one-site increase in
   the number of available telemedicine sites decreased minimum ATD by
   about 8\%. For a given group size, the best groupings were very similar
   in minimum travel distance. There were significant differences in
   predicted patient load imbalance between otherwise similar groupings. A
   majority of the best site groupings used the same small number of sites,
   and urban sites were heavily used.
   Discussion: With EHR geospatial data at an individual patient level, we
   can model potential telemedicine sites for specialty access in a rural
   geographic area. Relatively few sites could serve most of the
   population. Direct access to patient GIS data from an EHR provides
   direct knowledge of the client base compared to methods that allocate
   aggregated data.
   Conclusion: Geospatial data and methods can assist health care location
   planning, generating data about load, load balance, and spatial
   accessibility.}},

Abstract = {{Given the complexity of high-acuity health care, designing an effective
   clinical note template can be beneficial to both document patient care
   and clarify how telemedicine is used. We characterized documented
   interactions via a standardized note template between bedside intensive
   care unit (ICU) providers and teleintensivists in 2 Veterans Health
   Administration ICU telemedicine support centers. All ICUs linked to
   support centers and providing care from October 2012 through September
   2014 were considered. Interactions were assessed based on initiation
   site, bedside initiator, contact type, and patient care change. Of 14
   511 ICU admissions with teleintensivist access, teleintensivist
   interaction was documented in 21.6\% (N = 3136). In particular, contacts
   were primarily initiated by bedside staff (74.4\%), use increased over
   time, and of contacts resulting in changes in patient care, most were
   initiated by a bedside nurse (84.3\%). Given this variation, future
   research necessitates inclusion of utilization in evaluation of Tele-ICU
   and patient outcomes.}},

Title = {{Do health information technology self-management interventions improve
   glycemic control in medically underserved adults with diabetes? A
   systematic review and meta-analysis}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was
   to examine the effect of health information technology (HIT) diabetes
   self-management education (DSME) interventions on glycemic control in
   medically underserved patients.
   Materials and Methods: Following an a priori protocol, 5 databases were
   searched. Studies were appraised for quality using the Cochrane Risk of
   Bias assessment. Studies reporting either hemoglobin A1c pre- and
   post-intervention or its change at 6 or 12 months were eligible for
   inclusion in themeta-analysis using random effects models.
   Results: Thirteen studies met the criteria for the systematic review and
   10 for the meta-analysis and represent data from 3257 adults with
   diabetes (mean age 55 years; 66\% female; 74\% racial/ethnic
   minorities). Most studies (n = 10) reflected an unclear risk of bias.
   Interventions varied by HIT type: computer software without Internet (n
   = 2), cellular/automated telephone (n = 4), Internet-based (n = 4), and
   telemedicine/telehealth (n = 3). Pooled A1c decreases were found at 6
   months (-0.36 (95\% CI, -0.53 and -0.19]; I-2 = 35.1\%, Q = 5.0), with
   diminishing effect at 12 months (-0.27 {[}95\% CI, -0.49 and -0.04]; I-2
   = 42.4\%, Q = 10.4). Discussion: Findings suggest that medically
   underserved patients with diabetes achieve glycemic benefit following
   HIT DSME interventions, with dissipating but significant effects at 12
   months. Telemedicine/telehealth interventions were the most successful
   HIT type because they incorporated interaction with educators similar to
   in-person DSME.
   Conclusion: These results are similar to in-person DSME in medically
   underserved patients, showing that well-designed HIT DSME has the
   potential to increase access and improve outcomes for this vulnerable
   group.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Reconstructive surgical care can play a vital role in the
   resource-poor settings of low- and middle-income countries. Telemedicine
   platforms can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of surgical care.
   The purpose of this study is to determine whether remote digital video
   evaluations are reliable in the context of a short-term plastic surgical
   intervention.
   Setting: The setting for this study was a district hospital located in
   Latacunga, Ecuador.
   Patients: Participants were 27 consecutive patients who presented for
   operative repair of cleft lip and palate.
   Main Outcome Measures: We calculated kappa coefficients for reliability
   between in-person and remote digital video assessments for the
   classification of cleft lip and palate between two separate craniofacial
   surgeons. We hypothesized that the technology would be a reliable method
   of preoperative assessment for cleft disease.
   Results: Of the 27 (81.4\%) participants, 22 received operative
   treatment for their cleft disorder. Mean age was 11.1 +/- 8.3 years.
   Patients presented with a spectrum of disorders, including cleft lip (24
   of 27, 88.9\%), cleft palate (19 of 27, 70.4\%), and alveolar cleft (19
   of 27, 70.4\%). We found a 95.7\% agreement between observers for cleft
   lip with substantial reliability (kappa = .78, P < .01). There was an
   82.6\% agreement between observers for cleft palate, with a moderate
   interrater reliability (kappa = .55, P = .01). We found only a 47.8\%
   agreement between observers for alveolar cleft with a nonsignificant,
   weak kappa agreement (kappa = .06, P = .74).
   Conclusions: Remote digital assessments are a reliable way to
   preoperatively diagnose cleft lip and palate in the context of
   short-term plastic surgical interventions in low- and middle-income
   countries. Future work will evaluate the potential for real-time,
   telemedicine assessments to reduce cost and improve clinical
   effectiveness in global plastic surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of Review This study aims to describe the current state of
   telestroke clinical applications and policies, in addition to key
   technical and operational aspects of the telemedicine practice.
   Recent Findings Delivery of telestroke services for neurovascular care
   expanded from the intravenous alteplase decision and administration in
   acute emergency department settings to a continuum of services in mobile
   and inpatient stroke units, intensive care units, virtual stroke
   clinics, rehabilitation, and clinical research. Telestroke
   cost-effectiveness is well established from multiple perspectives.
   Stroke centers, certification agencies, and national registries have
   made essential recommendations regarding telestroke quality measures
   monitoring and reporting.
   Summary Telestroke continues to bring neurovascular expertise to
   resource-restricted areas with advanced virtual communication
   techniques, optimizing stroke care. Future research should aim at
   broadening telestroke technology applications, while improving quality
   and reducing the delivery-associated cost and resources. Comprehensive
   multidisciplinary virtual telestroke centers that cover all aspects of

Abstract = {{The consensus problem has become a key issue in the field of
   collaborative telemedicine systems because of the need to guarantee the
   consistency of shared data. In this paper, we focus on the performance
   of consensus algorithms. First, we studied, in the literature, the most
   well-known algorithms in the domain. Experiments on these algorithms
   allowed us to propose a new algorithm that enhances the performance of
   consensus in different situations. During 2014, we presented our very
   first initial thoughts to enhance the performance of the consensus
   algorithms, but the proposed solution gave very moderate results. The
   goal of this paper is to present a new enhanced consensus algorithm,
   named Fouad, Lionel and J.-Christophe (FLC). This new algorithm was
   built on the architecture of the Mostefaoui-Raynal (MR) consensus
   algorithm and integrates new features and some known techniques in order
   to enhance the performance of consensus in situations where process
   crashes are present in the system. The results from our experiments
   running on the simulation platform Neko show that the FLC algorithm
   gives the best performance when using a multicast network model on
   different scenarios: in the first scenario, where there are no process
   crashes nor wrong suspicion, and even in the second one, where multiple
   simultaneous process crashes take place in the system.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction In the last few years, the use of telecommunication and
   mobile technology has grown significantly. This has led to a notable
   increase in the utilization of this telecommunication in healthcare,
   namely phone calls and text messaging (SMS). However, evaluating its
   global impact on improving healthcare processes and outcomes demands a
   more comprehensive assessment. In this study, we focused on the role of
   mobile devices via phone calls and SMS in patient-doctor communication,
   and aimed to assess its impact on various health outcomes.
   Methods Major databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global
   Health, and Cochrane CENTRAL, were searched for clinical trials that
   investigated mobile-device technology in any facet of doctor-patient
   communication published between 1990 and April 2015. A meta-analysis was
   performed where appropriate.
   Results Sixty-two articles met our inclusion criteria. Of those, 23
   articles investigated mobile appointment reminder technologies, 19
   investigated medication adherence, 20 investigated disease-control
   interventions, and two investigated test-result reporting. Patients who
   received an appointment reminder were 10\% less likely to miss an
   appointment (relative risk {[}RR]=1.11, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   1.08-1.15). Mobile interventions increased medication adherence by 22\%
   (RR=1.22, 95\% CI 1.09-1.36). Ten of 20 studies examining disease
   control reported statistically significant reductions in clinically
   meaningful endpoints. The use of mobile-device interventions improved
   forced expiratory volume in one second and hemoglobin A1c percentage in
   meta-analyses.
   Conclusion The use of mobile-device technologies exerted modest
   improvements in communication and health outcomes. Further research is
   needed to determine the true effect of these technologies on
   doctor-patient communication.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: There is consistent evidence to indicate people living in
   rural and remote regions have limited access to healthcare and poorer
   health outcomes. One way to address this inequity is through innovative
   models of care such as telehealth. The aim of this pilot trial was to
   determine the feasibility, appropriateness and access to a telehealth
   clinic. In this pilot trial, the telehealth clinic outcomes are compared
   with the outreach clinic. Both models of care are commonly utilised
   means of providing healthcare to meet the needs of people living in
   rural and remote regions.
   Methods: A prospective audit was conducted on a Spinal Assessment Clinic
   Telehealth pilot trial for patients with spinal disorders requiring
   non-urgent surgical consultation. Data were recorded from all
   consultations managed using videoconferencing technology between the
   Royal Adelaide Hospital and Port Augusta Community Health Service, South
   Australia between September 2013 and January 2014. Outcomes included
   analysis of process, service activity, clinical actions, safety and
   costs. Data were compared to a previous spinal assessment outreach
   clinic in the same area between August and December 2012.
   Results: There were 25 consultations with 22 patients over the
   five-month telehealth pilot trial. Spinal disorders were predominantly
   of the lumbar region (88\%); the majority of initial consultations
   (64\%) were discharged to the general practitioner. There were three
   requests for further imaging, five for minor interventions and three for
   other specialist/surgical consultation. Patient follow-up post
   telehealth pilot trial revealed no adverse outcomes. The total cost of
   AUD\$11,187 demonstrated a 23\% reduction in favour of the spinal
   assessment telehealth pilot trial, with the greatest savings in travel
   costs.
   Discussion: The telehealth model of care demonstrated the efficient
   management of patients with spinal disorders in rural regions requiring
   non-urgent surgical consultation at low costs with no adverse outcomes
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: There has been very little use of telehealth in pre-hospital
   emergency medical services (EMS), yet the potential exists for this
   technology to transform the current delivery model. In this study, we
   explore the costs and benefits of one large telehealth EMS initiative.
   Methods: Using a case-control study design and both micro- and
   gross-costing data from the Houston Fire Department EMS electronic
   patient care record system, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis (CBA)
   comparing costs with potential savings associated with patients treated
   through a telehealth-enabled intervention. The intervention consisted of
   telehealth-based consultation between the 911 patient and an EMS
   physician, to evaluate and triage the necessity for patient transport to
   a hospital emergency department (ED). Patients with non-urgent, primary
   care-related conditions were then scheduled and transported by
   alternative means to an affiliated primary care clinic. We measured CBA
   as both total cost savings and cost per ED visit averted, in US Dollars
   (\$USD).
   Results: In total, 5570 patients were treated over the first full 12
   months with a telehealth-enabled care model. We found a 6.7\% absolute
   reduction in potentially medically unnecessary ED visits, and a
   44-minute reduction in total ambulance back-in-service times. The
   average cost for a telehealth patient was \$167, which was a
   statistically significantly \$103 less than the control group (p<.0001).
   The programme produced a \$928,000 annual cost savings from the societal
   perspective, or \$2468 cost savings per ED visit averted (benefit).
   Conclusion: Patient care enabled by telehealth in a pre-hospital
   environment, is a more cost effective alternative compared to the
   traditional EMS `treat and transport to ED' model.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Formal telestroke training for neurovascular
   fellows (NVFs) is necessary because of growing use of telestroke
   technologies in the management of acute ischemic stroke; yet,
   educational approaches and training benchmarks are not formalized. Time
   between telestroke consultant page and tissue-type plasminogen activator
   administration (page-to-needle time, PTNT) can provide an objective
   measure of proficiency. We compared PTNT between NVFs and neurovascular
   attendings (NVAs) and evaluated changes in PTNT with experience.
   Methods-We identified suspected acute ischemic stroke patients in our
   telestroke registry from July 2013 to December 2015 who received
   tissue-type plasminogen activator. Using multivariable quantile
   regression, we estimated the difference and 95\% confidence interval in
   median PTNT between NVFs and NVAs. We also report the coefficient of
   change in PTNT over increasing number of telestroke consults.
   Results-NVFs evaluated 53.7\% of 618 tissue-type plasminogen activator
   cases over telestroke. NVAs had significantly shorter PTNT compared with
   NVFs, with a difference in median PTNT of -9 minutes (95\% confidence
   interval, -12.3 to -5.7). This difference persisted when adjusted for
   relative tissue-type plasminogen activator contraindications. For each
   additional telestroke consult, PTNT decreased by 0.07 minutes for NVFs
   or NVAs (P=0.02 and <0.01, respectively).
   Conclusions-PTNT improves by approximate to 1 minute for every 14
   consults for both NVFs and NVAs. Our findings support the importance of
   integrating telestroke training into supervised neurovascular
   fellowships to increase proficiency prior to independent practice and
   suggest that PTNT can be a benchmark for tracking proficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Despite being in existence for >40 years, the application of
   telemedicine has lagged significantly in comparison to its generated
   interest. Detractors include the immobile design of most historic
   telemedicine interventions and the relative lack of smartphones among
   the general populace. Recently, the exponential increase in smartphone
   ownership and familiarity have provided the potential for the
   development of mobile health (mHealth) interventions that can be
   mirrored realistically in clinical applications. Existing studies have
   demonstrated some potential clinical benefits of mHealth in the various
   phases of solid organ transplantation (SOT). Furthermore, studies in
   nontransplant chronic diseases may be used to guide future studies in
   SOT. Nevertheless, substantially more must be accomplished before
   mHealth becomes mainstream. Further evidence of clinical benefits and a
   critical need for cost-effectiveness analysis must prove its utility to
   patients, clinicians, hospitals, insurers, and the federal government.
   The SOT population is an ideal one in which to demonstrate the benefits
   of mHealth. In this review, the current evidence and status of mHealth
   in SOT is discussed, and a general path forward is presented that will
   allow buy-in from the health care community, insurers, and the federal
   government to move mHealth from research to standard care.}},

Abstract = {{Background SaltSwitch is an innovative smartphone application (app) that
   enables shoppers to scan the barcode of a packaged food and receive an
   immediate, interpretive, traffic light nutrition label on the screen,
   along with suggestions for lower salt alternatives. Our aim was to
   determine the effectiveness of SaltSwitch to support people with
   cardiovascular disease to make lower salt food choices.
   Design Six-week, two-arm, parallel, randomised controlled trial in
   Auckland, New Zealand (2 weeks baseline and 4 weeks intervention).
   Methods Sixty-six adults with diagnosed cardiovascular disease (mean
   (SD) age 64 (7) years) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either
   the SaltSwitch smartphone app or control (usual care). The primary
   outcome was the salt content of household packaged food purchases during
   the 4-week intervention (g/MJ). Secondary outcomes were the saturated
   fat content (g/MJ), energy content (kJ/kg) and expenditure (NZ\$) of
   household food purchases; systolic blood pressure (mmHg), urinary sodium
   (mg) and use and acceptability of the SaltSwitch app.
   Results Thirty-three participants with cardiovascular disease were
   allocated to the SaltSwitch intervention, and 33 to the control group. A
   significant reduction in mean household purchases of salt was observed
   (mean difference (95\% confidence interval), -0.30 (-0.58 to -0.03)
   g/MJ), equating to a reduction of approximate to 0.7g of salt per person
   per day during the 4-week intervention phase. There were no significant
   between-group differences in any secondary outcomes (all P>0.05).
   Conclusions The SaltSwitch smartphone app is effective in supporting
   people with cardiovascular disease to make lower salt food purchases. A
   larger trial with longer follow-up is warranted to determine the effects
   on blood pressure.

Abstract = {{Background: Physician burnout is becoming an epidemic, due to the
   pressures of being productive, an imperfect electronic health record
   (EHR) system, and limited face-to-face time with patients. Poor
   usability in EHR-user interface can force users to go through more steps
   (i.e. more clicks on the computer) in accomplishing a task.Objective:
   This increased click burden' is a source of frustration for physicians.
   In the light of increased click burden and time due to meaningful use
   requirements, there is a need to improve the physician's experience by
   creating innovations in EHR.Method: This case study describes an attempt
   by physicians at NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital to
   enhance the EHR experience with more efficient methods of documentation,
   chart review, ordering and patient safety.Results: The EHR innovations
   trialled in this study were: a mobile documentation application;
   abnormal test results auto-populated into an EHR patient summary;
   physician alerts to reduce inappropriate test ordering; and a system of
   safety alerts on a dashboard. These innovations led to decreased click
   burden and allowed physicians to spend less time on the computer and
   more time with patients.Conclusion:Physician-driven changes to EHR
   systems have the potential to streamline virtual workflows and the
   management of health information and to improve patient safety, reduce
   physician burnout and increase physician job satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{Many surgical readmissions are preventable. Mobile health technology can

   We performed a pilot study of a new mobile health application in adults
   undergoing major abdominal surgery. Patients reported their pain,
   answered surveys, photographed their wound, were reminded to stay
   hydrated, and used a Fitbit (TM) device. Abnormal responses triggered
   alerts for further evaluation. Patients were followed postoperatively
   for 30 days and compliance with app use was tracked.
   Thirty-one patients participated. Most were female (58\%) and white
   (61\%). Six (19\%) had an ostomy as part of their surgery. 83.9\% of
   patients completed an app-related task at least 70\% of the time and
   89\% said using the app was easy to use. Patients generated an average
   of 1.1 alerts. One patient was readmitted and generated seven alerts
   prior to readmission. Patients participated most in collecting Fitbit
   data (84.8\% of days) and completing a single-item photoaffective meter,
   but had more difficulty uploading photographs (51.4\% completed).
   Eighty-nine percent of patients found the application easy to use.
   A novel mobile health app can track patient recovery from major

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background and purpose: There is widespread geographic variation in
   healthcare quality, but we often lack clear strategies for improving
   quality in underserved areas. This study characterized geographic
   disparities in stroke care quality to assess whether improved access to
   neurological services has the potential to bridge the care quality gap,
   particularly in terms of alteplase (rt-PA) administration.
   Methods: This was a retrospective study using quality performance data
   from the 2015 Hospital Compare database linked to information on
   certification status from the Joint Commission and information on local
   access to neurological services from the Area Health Resources File. We
   used these data to compare stroke care quality according to geographic
   area, certification, and neurologist access.
   Results: Non-metropolitan hospitals performed worse than metropolitan
   hospitals on all assessed stroke care quality measures. The most
   prevalent disparity occurred in the use of rt-PA for eligible patients
   (52.2\% versus 82.7\%, respectively). Certified stroke centers in every
   geographic designation provided higher quality of care, whereas large
   variation was observed among non-certified hospitals. Regression
   analyses suggested that improvements in hospital certification or access
   to neurologists were associated with absolute improvements of 44.9\% and
   21.3\%, respectively, in the percentage of patients receiving rt-PA.
   Conclusions: The large quality gap in stroke care between metropolitan
   and non-metropolitan areas could be at least partly addressed through
   improved procedural efforts by stroke center certification increasing
   the supply of neurological services, (i.e. through training and hiring
   new neurologists) or by adopting decision support systems such as
   telemedicine. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Here we report the feasibility and acceptability of telehealth for
   direct intervention in children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).
   Children with PWS have social-cognitive challenges that are similar to
   children with ASD. However, developing behavioral interventions for
   individuals with PWS is faced with the significant challenge of
   enrolling enough participants for local studies where multiple visits
   per week are indicated for effective intervention. This study delivered
   a 6-week play-based intervention via telehealth directly to eight
   children with PWS (6-12 years). Participants completed the program with
   minimal behavioral or technological difficulty (\#sessions M =
   11.875/12). Behavioral Intervention Rating Scale results indicate good
   acceptability (M = 5.54/6.00). These findings support using telehealth
   in rare disorders and delivering intervention directly to children with
   developmental delays through this modality.}},

Title = {{Interhospital Transfer of Neurosurgical Patients: Implications of Timing

Volume = {{81}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Interhospital transfer of neurosurgical patients is common;
   however, little is known about the impact of transfer parameters on
   clinical outcomes. Lower survival rates have been reported for patients
   admitted at night and on weekends in other specialties. Whether time or
   day of admission affects neurosurgical patient outcomes, specifically
   those transferred from other facilities, is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of the timing of interhospital transfer
   on the hospital course and clinical outcomes of neurosurgical patients.
   METHODS: All consecutive admissions of patients transferred to our adult
   neurosurgical service were retrospectively analyzed for a 1-year study
   period using data from a central transfer database and the electronic
   health record.
   RESULTS: Patients arrived more often at night (70.8\%) despite an even
   distribution of transfer requests. The lack of transfer imaging did not
   affect length of stay, intervention times, or patient outcomes. Daytime
   arrivals had shorter total transfer time, but longer intenstive care
   unit and overall length of stay (8.7 and 11.6 days, respectively), worse
   modified Rankin Scale scores, lower rates of functional independence,
   and almost twice the mortality rate. Weekend admissions had
   significantly worse modified Rankin Scale scores and lower rates of
   functional independence.
   CONCLUSIONS: The timing of transfer arrivals, both by hour or day of the
   week, is correlated with the time to intervention, hospital course, and
   overall patient outcomes. Patients admitted during the weekend suffered
   worse functional outcomes and a trend towards increased mortality. While
   transfer logistics clearly impact patient outcomes, further work is
   needed to understand these complex relationships.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between distance traveled for an
   abortion and site of postabortion care among low-income women.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using claims data
   from 39,747 abortions covered by California's Medicaid program in
   2011-2012. Primary outcomes were the odds of abortion-related visits to
   an emergency department (ED) and the original abortion site, and the
   secondary outcome was total abortion care costs. We used mixed-effects
   logistic regression adjusting for patient and abortion characteristics
   to examine the associations between distance traveled and subsequent
   abortion-related care at each location.
   RESULTS: Among all abortions (N=39,747), 3\% (95\% CI 2.9-3.3, n=1,232)
   were followed by an ED visit (3\% first-trimester aspirations, 2\%
   second trimester or later, and 4\% medication abortions) and 25\% (95\%
   CI 24.1-24.9, n=9,745) were followed by a visit to the original abortion
   site (4\% first-trimester aspirations, 3\% second trimester or later,
   and 77\% medication abortions). Women traveling farther for their
   abortions had higher odds of visiting an ED (100 or more miles compared
   with less than 25 miles, first-trimester aspirations: adjusted odds
   ratio {[}OR] 2.29, 95\% CI 1.50-3.49; medication abortions: adjusted OR
   2.30, 95\% CI 1.34-3.93) and lower odds of returning to their abortion
   site for follow-up (100 or more miles compared with less than 25 miles,
   first-trimester aspirations: adjusted OR 0.36, 95\% CI 0.18-0.70; second
   trimester or later: adjusted OR 0.52, 95\% CI 0.31-0.88; and medication
   abortions: adjusted OR 0.33, 95\% CI 0.23-0.50). Costs were consistently
   higher when subsequent care occurred at an ED rather than the abortion
   site (median cost \$941 compared with \$536, P<.001).
   CONCLUSION: For most patients, greater distance traveled for abortion
   was associated with increased likelihood of seeking subsequent care at
   an ED. Increasing the number of rural Medicaid abortion providers and
   reimbursing providers for telemedicine and alternatives to routine
   follow-up would likely improve continuity of care and reduce state costs
   by shifting the location of follow-up from EDs back to abortion
   providers.}},

Abstract = {{Context: The health and economic burden of hypertension, a major risk
   factor for cardiovascular disease, is substantial. This systematic
   review evaluated the economic evidence of self-measured blood pressure
   (SMBP) monitoring interventions to control hypertension.
   Evidence acquisition: The literature search from database inception to
   March 2015 identified 22 studies for inclusion with three types of
   interventions: SMBP used alone, SMBP with additional support, and SMBP
   within team-based care (TBC). Two formulae were used to convert
   reductions in systolic BP (SBP) to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)
   to produce cost per QALY saved. All analyses were conducted in 2015,
   with estimates adjusted to 2014 U.S. dollars.
   Evidence synthesis: Median costs of intervention were \$60 and \$174 per
   person for SMBP alone and SMBP with additional support, respectively,
   and \$732 per person per year for SMBP within TBC. SMBP alone and SMBP
   with additional support reduced healthcare cost per person per year from
   outpatient visits and medication (medians \$148 and \$3, respectively;
   median follow-up, 12-13 months). SMBP within TBC exhibited an increase
   in healthcare cost (median, \$369 per person per year; median follow-up,
   18 months). SMBP alone varied from cost saving to a maximum cost of
   \$144,000 per QALY saved, with two studies reporting an increase in SBP.
   The two translated median costs per QALY saved were \$2,800 and \$4,000
   for SMBP with additional support and \$7,500 and \$10,800 for SMBP
   within TBC.
   Conclusions: SMBP monitoring interventions with additional support or
   within TBC are cost effective. Cost effectiveness of SMBP used alone
   could not be determined. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of

Abstract = {{Purpose The force with which the diaphragm chestpiece of a stethoscope
   is pressed against the body of a patient during an auscultation
   examination introduces the initial stress and deformation to the
   diaphragm and the underlying tissues, thus altering the acoustic
   parameters of the sound transmission path. If the examination is
   performed by an experienced physician, he will intuitively adjust the
   amount of the force in order to achieve the optimal sound quality.
   However, in case of becoming increasingly popular auto-diagnosis and
   telemedicine auscultation devices with no such feedback mechanisms, the
   question arises regarding the influence of the possible force mismatch
   on the parameters of the recorded signal.
   Design The present study describes the results of the experimental
   investigations on the relation between pressure applied to the
   chestpiece of a stethoscope and parameters of the transmitted
   bioacoustic signals. The experiments were carried out using various
   stethoscopes connected to a force measurement system, which allowed to
   maintain fixed pressure during auscultation examinations. The signals
   were recorded during examinations of different volunteers, at various
   auscultation sites.
   Results The obtained results reveal strong individual and
   auscultation-site variability.
   Conclusions It is concluded that the underlying tissue deformation is
   the primary factor that alters the parameters of the recorded signals.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Both the demands and the options for patients to
   communicate with health care providers utilizing eHealth solutions are
   increasing. Some patients, or relatives to patients, want to consult
   another health care provider than the regular one, merely in text.
   Objective: To improve text-based medical consultation by learning from
   long-term experiences.
   Materials and methods: Physicians with comprehensive experience of
   answering free-text medical inquiries at an official health portal in
   Sweden were interviewed. The interviews were analyzed using a grounded
   theory approach.
   Results: Over time, the interviewed physicians developed strategies on
   how to formulate the answer to a medical inquiry from a previously
   unknown inquirer. The answering physicians experienced their primary
   role as providers of medical information and as mediators between an
   inquirer and the regular health care provider. Many of the answering
   physicians experienced a personal development with improved
   communication skills, also in face-to-face meetings with patients.
   Conclusion: Text-based medical consultation is part of an expanding area
   in eHealth. The development of strategies, guidelines, ethical
   considerations as well as educational efforts are needed to optimize the

Abstract = {{Nowadays medical data in terms of image files are often exchanged
   between different hospitals for use in telemedicine and diagnosis.
   Visible watermarking being extensively used for Intellectual Property
   identification of such medical images, leads to serious issues if failed
   to identify proper regions for watermark insertion. In this paper, the
   Region of Non-Interest (RONI) based visible watermarking for medical
   image authentication is proposed. In this technique, to RONI of the
   cover medical image is first identified using Human Visual System (HVS)
   model. Later, watermark logo is visibly inserted into RONI of the cover
   medical image to get watermarked medical image. Finally, the watermarked
   medical image is compared with the original medical image for
   measurement of imperceptibility and authenticity of proposed scheme. The
   experimental results showed that this proposed scheme reduces the
   computational complexity and improves the PSNR when compared to many
   existing schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Medical images are more typical than any other ordinary images, since it
   stores patient's information for diagnosis purpose. Such images need
   more security and confidentiality as total diagnosis depends on it. In
   telemedicine applications, transmission of medical image via open
   channel, demands strong security and copyright protection. In our
   proposed robust watermarking model, a double layer security is
   introduced to ensure the robustness of embedded data. The embedded data
   is scrambled using a unique key and then a transform domain based hybrid
   watermarking technique is used to embed the scrambled data into the
   transform coefficients of the host image. The data embedding in medical
   images involves more attention, so that the diagnosis part must not be
   affected by any modification. Therefore, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is
   used as a classifier, which classify a medical image into two regions
   i.e. Non Region of Interest (NROI) and Region of Interest (ROI) to embed
   watermark data into the NROI part of the medical image, using the
   proposed embedding algorithm. The objective of the proposed model is to
   avoid any quality degradation to the medical image. The simulation is
   performed to measure the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) for
   imperceptibility and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to test the
   robustness. The experimented result shows, robustness and
   imperceptibility with SSIM of more than 0.50 and PSNR of more than 35 dB
   for proposed watermarking model.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BREATH RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Recognition of the huge economic burden chronic respiratory diseases
   pose for society motivated fundamental and clinical research leading to
   insight into the role of airway inflammation in various disease entities
   and their phenotypes. However, no easy, cheap and patient-friendly
   methods to assess it have found a place in routine clinical practice.
   Measurement of exhaled breath temperature (EBT) has been suggested as a
   non-invasive method to detect inflammatory processes in the airways as a
   result of increased blood flow within the airway walls. As EBT values
   are within a narrow range, the thermometers designed for the purpose of
   assessing it need to be precise and very sensitive. EBT increases
   linearly over the pediatric age range and seems to be influenced by
   gender, but not by height and body weight. In non-smoking individuals
   with no history of respiratory disease EBT has a natural circadian peak
   about noon and increases with food intake and physical exercise. When
   interpreting EBT in subjects with alleged airway pathology, the
   possibilities of tissue destruction (chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease, cystic fibrosis) or excessive bronchial obstruction and air
   trapping (severe asthma) need to be considered, as these conditions
   drive (force) EBT down. A prominent advantage of the method is to assess
   EBT when patients are in a steady state of their disease and to use this
   `personal best' to monitor them and guide their treatment. Individual
   devices outfitted with microprocessors and memory have been created,
   which can be used for personalized monitoring and disease management by
   telemedicine.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   The aim of this study is to review the basic concepts of electronic
   health (eHealth), with a focus on its nutritional applications and its
   usefulness for digestive diseases.
   Recent findings
   eHealth applications for the treatment and monitoring of digestive
   disease are growing in number. ehealth helps patients in coping with
   their disease by promoting self-management, which increases adherence to
   medical treatment and diets, and leads to an improved quality of life.
   For irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), there are multiple applications that
   provide dietary advice, for example, a low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligo,
   Mono, Disaccharides And Polyols) diet. However, many applications lack a
   symptom scoring function and do not include a module for assisting the
   essential reintroduction of high FODMAP foods. In general, there are
   very few applications that enable direct patient communication with
   healthcare professionals. A more holistic approach that educates
   patients and enables them to communicate directly with eCare provider
   through a web application is one of the functions most requested by
   patients.
   Summary
   eHealth solutions for digestive diseases have a supportive function and
   a positive impact on patients. However, there is a need to increase
   patient education and further develop the possibility for care
   team-patient communication within eHealth solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   HIV prevention and care is changing rapidly; guideline revisions and
   programmatic scale-up require innovative approaches to in-service
   training and care extension to improve provider practice and care
   access. We assessed recent (12 months) peer-reviewed publications on
   electronic health (eHealth), telemedicine, and other innovative
   provider-targeted interventions for HIV-related care.
   Recent findings
   Key developments included systems merging electronic medical records
   (EMR) with provider clinical decision aids to prompt action,
   demonstration eHealth, and telemedicine projects, reviews or
   descriptions of technology to improve connectivity in lower resource
   settings, and a few trials on provider-centered interventions. Most
   publications were program reports and few data were available regarding
   efficacy of eHealth interventions for providers on patient HIV-related
   outcomes, notably identification and management of antiretroviral
   treatment failure in Kenya. Better evidence is needed for strategies to
   train providers and care extenders with the goal to improve impact of
   HIV prevention and care interventions.
   Summary
   Rapid technology introduction and expansion may change the paradigm for
   improving provider knowledge and practice. Although new, the
   developments are promising for HIV provider-targeted eHealth and
   innovations for traditional training. More rigorous testing with
   randomized trials is needed to demonstrate impact on services for people
   living with HIV.}},

Abstract = {{Telemonitoring for COPD has gained much attention thanks to its
   potential of reducing morbidity and mortality, healthcare utilisation
   and costs. However, its benefit with regard to clinical and economic
   outcomes remains to be clearly demonstrated.
   To analyse the effect of Europe's largest COPD telemonitoring pilot
   project on direct medical costs, health resource utilisation and
   mortality at 12 months.
   We evaluated a population-based cohort using administrative data.
   Difference-in-difference estimators were calculated to account for
   time-invariant unobservable heterogeneity after removing dissimilarities
   in observable characteristics between the telemonitoring and control
   group with a reweighting algorithm.
   The analysis comprised 651 telemonitoring participants and 7047
   individuals in the standard care group. The mortality hazards ratio was
   lower in the intervention arm (HR 0.51, 95 \% CI 0.30-0.86).
   Telemonitoring cut total costs by 895 a,notsign (p < 0.05) compared to
   COPD standard care, mainly driven by savings in COPD-related
   hospitalisations in (very) severe COPD patients (-1056 a,notsign, p <
   0.0001). Telemonitoring enrolees used healthcare (all-cause and
   COPD-related) less intensely with shorter hospital stays, fewer
   inpatient stays and smaller proportions of people with emergency
   department visits and hospitalisations (all p < 0.0001). Reductions in
   mortality, costs and healthcare utilisation were greater for (very)
   severe COPD cases.
   This is the first German study to demonstrate that telemonitoring for
   COPD is a viable strategy to reduce mortality, healthcare costs and
   utilisation at 12 months. Contrary to widespread fear, reducing the
   intensity of care does not seem to impact unfavourably on health
   outcomes. The evidence offers strong support for introducing
   telemonitoring as a component of case management.}},

   healthcare products and multimedia software, and suggest ways to
   stimulate their use by analyzing the effect of a consistent awareness of
   one's health status on the change in one's exercise habits and
   health-improvement activities. To examine the difference in the level of
   interest in health and the amount of exercise between a group of
   individuals that consistently utilized a personalized health management
   program using a Home healthcare PC with a workstation and a group of
   individuals who did not, a 16-week study was conducted on 143 male and
   female adults residing in the Gyeonggnam region. Pedometers were
   provided to measure the amount of exercise, and a survey was conducted
   to examine the changes in the awareness of health-improvement
   activities. The group of individuals who regularly checked and managed
   their health status showed a statistically significant increase in the
   number of steps they took, compared to the group who did not. In
   addition, a group that utilized the Home healthcare PC showed an
   increase in the behavior of seeking health counseling and exchanging
   information about health. This implies that the use of the Home
   healthcare PC draws users' attention to their health status and
   increases the motivation to exercise. The use of a Home healthcare PC
   not only acts as a red flag for the health of the users but also
   provides a bio-feedback effect. Therefore this system will play an
   effective role in prevention and post-incidence management of metabolic
   syndromes by motivating the users to systemically and independently
   manage their health at home, and to exercise or carry out
   health-improvement activities.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the evolution of the connected health concept is analysed
   and visualized to investigate the ever-tightening relationship between
   health and technology as well as emerging possibilities regarding
   delivery of healthcare services. A scientometric analysis was undertaken
   to investigate the trends and evolutionary relations between health and
   information systems through the queries in the Web of Science database
   using terms related to health and information systems. To understand the
   evolutionary relation between different concepts, scientometric analyses
   were conducted within five-year intervals using the VantagePoint,
   SciMAT, and CiteSpace II software. Consequently, the main stream of
   publications related to the connected health concept matching
   telemedicine cluster was determined. All other developments in health
   and technologies were discussed around this main stream across years.
   The trends obtained through the analysis provide insights about the
   future of healthcare and technology relationship particularly with
   rising importance of privacy, personalized care along with mobile
   networks and mobile infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrophilic porous substrates, in particular paper, are now widely used
   for the fabrication of microfluidic devices. These materials are very
   attractive because of their low-cost and their ability to generate
   capillary flow. Such materials avoid the need of external pressure
   sources or syringe pumps. However, capillary flows wicking a hydrophilic
   fiber matrix experience non-specific adsorption and depend on
   environmental conditions such as humidity. In this article a novel
   fabrication method is proposed to create low-cost embossed-paper
   microfluidic devices allowing for spontaneous capillary flow. Thus,
   embossing is used to design hollow microfluidic channels and chambers on
   a waterproof and hydrophilic paper surface. Because the hollow-channels
   obtained are fiber-free, the issues of imbibition are avoided. Besides,
   the paper surface being hydrophilic, the capillary flow in the embossed
   device is spontaneous. Thus, such microfluidic devices provide an
   efficient support to perform diagnostics in resource-poor settings. In
   this work, it is shown that a colorimetric glucose detection can be
   achieved using embossed-paper channels. The detection is achieved in
   twelve minutes, either by naked eyes or by analyzing pictures taking
   with a smartphone camera for quantification. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{E-HEALTHCARE FOR DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2 PATIENTS - A RANDOMISED

Journal = {{ZDRAVSTVENO VARSTVO}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Background. Telemonitoring and web-based interventions are increasingly
   used in primary-care practices in many countries for more effective
   management of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). A new approach in
   treating patients with diabetes mellitus in family practices, based on
   ICT use and nurse practitioners, has been introduced and evaluated in
   this study.
   Method. Fifteen Slovene family practices enrolled 120 DM patients
   treated only with a diet regime and/or tablets into the study. 58 of
   them were included into the interventional group, and the other 62 DM
   patients into the control group, within one-year-long interventional,
   randomised controlled trial. Patients in the control group had
   conventional care for DM according to Slovenian professional guidelines,
   while the patients in the interventional group were using also the
   eDiabetes application. Patients were randomised through a balanced
   randomisation process.
   Results. Significant reductions of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values
   were found after 6 and 12 months among patients using this eDiabetes
   application (p < 0.05). Among these patients, a significant correlation
   was also found between self-monitored blood pressure and the final HbA1c
   values. Diabetic patients' involvement in web-based intervention had
   only transient impact on their functional health status.
   Conclusion. This eDiabetes application was confirmed to be an innovative
   approach for better self-management of DM type 2 patients not using
   insulin. Both a significant reduction of HbA1c values and a significant
   correlation between the average self-measured blood pressure and the
   final HbA1c values in the interventional group were found. Nurse
   practitioners - as diabetes care coordinators - could contribute to
   better adherence in diabetes e-care.}},

   services - an overview of evidence from systematic reviews}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Telephone triage and advice services (TTAS) are increasingly
   being implemented around the world. These services allow people to speak
   to a nurse or general practitioner over the telephone and receive
   assessment and healthcare advice. There is an existing body of research
   on the topic of TTAS, however the diffuseness of the evidence base makes
   it difficult to identify key lessons that are consistent across the
   literature. Systematic reviews represent the highest level of evidence
   synthesis. We aimed to undertake an overview of such reviews to
   determine the scope, consistency and generalisability of findings in
   relation to the governance, safety and quality of TTAS.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and
   the Cochrane Library for English language systematic reviews focused on
   key governance, quality and safety findings related to telephone based
   triage and advice services, published since 1990. The search was
   undertaken by three researchers who reached consensus on all included
   systematic reviews. An appraisal of the methodological quality of the
   systematic reviews was independently undertaken by two researchers using
   A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews.
   Results: Ten systematic reviews from a potential 291 results were
   selected for inclusion. TTAS was examined either alone, or as part of a
   primary care service model or intervention designed to improve primary
   care. Evidence of TTAS performance was reported across nine key
   indicators - access, appropriateness, compliance, patient satisfaction,
   cost, safety, health service utilisation, physician workload and
   clinical outcomes. Patient satisfaction with TTAS was generally high and
   there is some consistency of evidence of the ability of TTAS to reduce
   clinical workload. Measures of the safety of TTAS tended to show that
   there is no major difference between TTAS and traditional care.
   Conclusions: Taken as a whole, current evidence does not provide
   definitive answers to questions about the quality of care provided,
   access and equity of the service, its costs and outcomes. The available
   evidence also suggests that there are many interactional factors (e.g.,
   relationship with other health service providers) which can impact on
   measures of performance, and also affect the external validity of the
   research findings.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging field of teleneurology is delivering quality care to
   neurologic patients in increasingly numerous technologies and
   configurations. Teleneurology is well-positioned to address many of the
   logistical issues neurologists and their patients encounter today.
   However, formalized medical training has not caught up with this
   developing field, and there is a lack of formal education concentrating
   on the specific opportunities and challenges of teleneurology.
   Considering this, the American Academy of Neurology Telemedicine Work
   Group identified equivalencies with which any practitioner of
   teleneurology should be familiar. The purpose of this curriculum is not
   to define teleneurology or mandate where its use is appropriate, but
   rather to provide guidance on basic equivalencies that students,
   residents, and practitioners should know while practicing teleneurology.
   Comprehensive training in clinical bedside neurology is necessary to
   safely practice teleneurology and the components of this curriculum are
   an extension of that training. In this article, we offer a detailed
   discussion on the rationale for the contents of this curriculum and
   conclude by providing a model curriculum and an outline for evaluating
   residents in teleneurology.}},

Abstract = {{Despite their potential for telemedicine in diabetic foot ulcer
   treatment, diagnostic accuracy of assessment of diabetic foot ulcers
   using mobile phone images is unknown. Our aim was to determine the
   validity and reliability of remote diabetic foot ulcer assessment using
   mobile phone images. Fifty diabetic foot ulcers were assessed live and
   photographed. Five independent observers remotely assessed the mobile
   phone images twice for presence of nine clinical characteristics and
   three treatment decisions. Positive likelihood (LLR+) and negative
   likelihood (LLR-) ratios were calculated for validity. Multirater
   Randolph's and bi-rater Bennet kappa values were calculated for
   reliability. LLR+ ranged from 1.3-4.2; LLR-ranged from 0.13-0.88; the
   treatment decision `peri-wound debridement' was the only item with
   `strong diagnostic evidence'. Inter-observer reliability kappa ranged
   from 0.09-0.71; test-retest reliability from 0.45-0.86; the treatment
   decision peri-wounddebridement' was the only item with ` adequate
   agreement'. In conclusion, mobile phone images had low validity and
   reliability for remote assessment of diabetic foot ulcers and should not
   be used as a stand-alone diagnostic instrument. Clinicians who use
   mobile phone images in clinical practice should obtain as much
   additional information as possible when making treatment decisions based
   on these images, and be cautious of the low diagnostic accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Follow-up care after kidney transplantation is performed in
   transplant centers as well as in local nephrologist's practices in
   Germany. However, organized integrated care of these different sectors
   of the German health care system is missing. This organizational deficit
   as well as non-adherence of kidney recipients and longterm
   cardiovascular complications are major reasons for an impaired patient
   and graft survival.
   Methods: The KTx360 degrees study is supported by a grant from the
   Federal Joint Committee of the Federal Republic of Germany.
   The study will include 448 (39 children) incident patients of all ages
   with KTx after study start in May 2017 and 963 (83 children) prevalent
   patients with KTx between 2010 and 2016. The collaboration between
   transplant centers and nephrologists in private local practices will be
   supported by internet-based case-files and scheduled virtual visits
   (patient consultation via video conferencing). At specified points of
   the care process patients will receive cardiovascular and adherence
   assessments and respective interventions. Care will be coordinated by an
   additional case management. The goals of the study will be evaluated by
   an independent institute using claims data from the statutory health
   insurances and data collected from patients and their caregivers during
   study participation. To model longitudinal changes after transplantation
   and differences in changes and levels of immunosuppresive therapy after
   transplantation between study participants and historical data as well
   as data from control patients who do not participate in KTx360 degrees,
   adjusted regression analyses, such as mixed models with repeated
   measures, will be used. Relevant confounders will be controlled in all
   analyses.
   Discussion: The study aims to prolong patient and graft survival, to
   reduce avoidable hospitalizations, co-morbidities and health care costs,
   and to enhance quality of life of patients after kidney transplantation.}},

Title = {{Service provider perceptions of transitioning from audio to video
   capability in a telehealth system: a qualitative evaluation}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Telephone consultation and triage services are increasingly
   being used to deliver health advice. Availability of high speed internet
   services in remote areas allows healthcare providers to move from
   telephone to video telehealth services. Current approaches for assessing
   video services have limitations. This study aimed to identify the
   challenges for service providers associated with transitioning from
   audio to video technology.
   Methods: Using a mixed-method, qualitative approach, we observed
   training of service providers who were required to switch from telephone
   to video, and conducted pre- and post-training interviews with 15
   service providers and their trainers on the challenges associated with
   transitioning to video. Two full days of simulation training were
   observed. Data were transcribed and analysed using an inductive
   approach; a modified constant comparative method was employed to
   identify common themes.
   Results: We found three broad categories of issues likely to affect
   implementation of the video service: social, professional, and
   technical. Within these categories, eight sub-themes were identified;
   they were: enhanced delivery of the health service, improved health
   advice for people living in remote areas, safety concerns, professional
   risks, poor uptake of video service, system design issues, use of
   simulation for system testing, and use of simulation for system
   training.
   Conclusions: This study identified a number of unexpected potential
   barriers to successful transition from telephone to the video system.
   Most prominent were technical and training issues, and personal safety
   concerns about transitioning from telephone to video media. Addressing
   identified issues prior to implementation of a new video telehealth
   system is likely to improve effectiveness and uptake.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Ultrasound (US) is a burgeoning diagnostic tool and is often
   the only available imaging modality in low and middle-income countries
   (LMICs). However, bedside providers often lack training to acquire or
   interpret US images. We conducted a study to determine if a remote
   tele-intensivist could mentor geographically removed LMIC providers to
   obtain quality and clinically useful US images.
   Materials and methods: Nine Haitian non-physician health care workers
   received a 20-minute training on basic US techniques. A volunteer was
   connected to an intensivist located in the USA via FaceTime. The
   intensivist remotely instructed the non-physicians to ultrasound five
   anatomic sites. The tele-intensivist evaluated the image quality and
   clinical utility of performing tele-ultrasound in a LMIC.
   Results: The intensivist agreed (defined as ``agree{''} or ``strongly
   agree{''} on a five-point Likert scale) that 90\% (57/63) of the
   FaceTime images were high quality. The intensivist felt comfortable
   making clinical decisions using FaceTime images 89\% (56/63) of the
   time.
   Conclusions: Non-physicians can feasibly obtain high-quality and
   clinically relevant US images using video chat software in LMICs.
   Commercially available software can connect providers in institutions in
   LMICs to geographically removed intensivists at a relatively low cost
   and without the need for extensive training of local providers. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Background The use of telehealth steadily increases as it has become a
   viable modality to patient care. Early adopters attempt to use
   telehealth to deliver high-quality care. Patient satisfaction is a key
   indicator of how well the telemedicine modality met patient
   expectations.
   Objective The objective of this systematic review and narrative analysis
   is to explore the association of telehealth and patient satisfaction in
   regards to effectiveness and efficiency.
   Methods Boolean expressions between keywords created a complex search
   string. Variations of this string were used in Cumulative Index of
   Nursing and Allied Health Literature and MEDLINE.
   Results 2193 articles were filtered and assessed for suitability (n=44).
   Factors relating to effectiveness and efficiency were identified using
   consensus. The factors listed most often were improved outcomes (20\%),
   preferred modality (10\%), ease of use (9\%), low cost 8\%), improved
   communication (8\%) and decreased travel time (7\%), which in total
   accounted for 61\% of occurrences.
   Conclusion This review identified a variety of factors of association
   between telehealth and patient satisfaction. Knowledge of these factors
   could help implementers to match interventions as solutions to specific

Title = {{A randomised trial of non-mydriatic ultra-wide field retinal imaging
   versus usual care to screen for diabetic eye disease: rationale and
   protocol for the Clearsight trial}},
Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Suboptimal screening for diabetic eye disease is a major
   cause of preventable vision loss. Screening barriers include mydriasis
   and the extra time patients need to attend dedicated eye screening
   appointments. In the Clearsight trial, we are testing whether screening
   by non-mydriatic ultra-wide field (NM UWF) imaging on the day patients
   attend their diabetes outpatient clinic visit improves detection of
   clinically important eye disease compared with usual screening.
   Methods and analysis Patients with diabetes due for a screening eye exam
   by the 2013 Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) practice guidelines are
   being randomised to on-site screening by NM UWF imaging on the day of
   their clinic visit or to usual screening where, per CDA guidelines, they
   are encouraged to arrange an exam by an optometrist. The primary outcome
   is actionable eye disease (AED) based on a need for referral to
   ophthalmology and/or increased ocular surveillance. The primary analysis
   will use an intention-to-screen approach that compares the proportions
   of detected AED between on-site and usual screening groups under a
   superiority hypothesis in favour of on-site screening. With 740
   randomised participants, the study will have 80\% power to detect >= 5\%
   absolute increase in the AED rate among on-site screening versus usual
   screening participants. This difference translates into a
   number-needed-to-screen by on-site screening of 20 to detect 1
   additional person with AED.
   Ethics and dissemination The protocol was approved by the institutional
   review board of Western University. The findings of the trial will be
   disseminated directly to participants and through peer-reviewed
   publications and conference presentations.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{491-500}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background Research has outlined the benefits and costs of online health
   services, but these studies have typically focused on a specific
   geographic region or disease. Very few studies have estimated consumer
   demand for online health services.
   Objective This study estimated household's willingness to pay (WTP) for
   the ability to receive remote diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and
   consultations online (telehealth).
   Methods WTP was estimated with a random utility model and household data
   from a US survey employing repeated discrete-choice experiments.
   Results The representative household was willing to pay \$US4.39 per
   month for telehealth. This valuation increased to \$US5.85 for
   households with higher opportunity costs, as measured by income, and to
   \$US6.22 for households living more than 20 miles away from their
   nearest medical facility.
   Conclusion WTP estimates offer insights into the potential benefits from
   policies intended to promote the expansion of online health services
   into underserved areas. These include the Federal Communications
   Commission's Rural Healthcare Pilot Program and the Department of
   Agriculture's Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants programme.}},

Title = {{Behavior Change Techniques in Physical Activity eHealth Interventions
   for People With Cardiovascular Disease: Systematic Review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of
   premature death and disability in Europe, accounting for 4 million
   deaths per year and costing the European Union economy almost (sic)196
   billion annually. There is strong evidence to suggest that
   exercise-based secondary rehabilitation programs can decrease the
   mortality risk and improve health among patients with CVD.
   Theory-informed use of behavior change techniques (BCTs) is important in
   the design of cardiac rehabilitation programs aimed at changing
   cardiovascular risk factors. Electronic health (eHealth) is the use of
   information and communication technologies (ICTs) for health. This
   emerging area of health care has the ability to enhance self-management
   of chronic disease by making health care more accessible, affordable,
   and available to the public. However, evidence-based information on the
   use of BCTs in eHealth interventions is limited, and particularly so,
   for individuals living with CVD.
   Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the
   application of BCTs in eHealth interventions designed to increase
   physical activity (PA) in CVD populations.
   Methods: A total of 7 electronic databases, including EBSCOhost
   (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, SPORTDiscus with Full
   Text, and CINAHL Complete), Scopus, and Web of Science (Core Collection)
   were searched. Two authors independently reviewed references using the
   software package Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation). The reviewers
   met to resolve any discrepancies, with a third independent reviewer
   acting as an arbitrator when required. Following this, data were
   extracted from the papers that met the inclusion criteria. Bias
   assessment of the studies was carried out using the Cochrane
   Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias within Covidence;
   this was followed by a narrative synthesis.
   Results: Out of the 987 studies that were identified, 14 were included
   in the review. An additional 9 studies were added following a hand
   search of review paper references. The average number of BCTs used
   across the 23 studies was 7.2 (range 1-19). The top three most
   frequently used BCTs included information about health consequences
   (78\%, 18/23), goal setting (behavior; 74\%, 17/23), and joint third,
   self-monitoring of behavior and social support (practical) were included
   in 11 studies (48\%, 11/23) each.
   Conclusions: This systematic review is the first to investigate the use
   of BCTs in PA eHealth interventions specifically designed for people
   with CVD. This research will have clear implications for health care
   policy and research by outlining the BCTs used in eHealth interventions
   for chronic illnesses, in particular CVD, thereby providing clear
   foundations for further research and developments in the area.}},

Title = {{Key Components in eHealth Interventions Combining Self-Tracking and
   Persuasive eCoaching to Promote a Healthier Lifestyle: A Scoping Review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: The combination of self-tracking and persuasive eCoaching in
   automated interventions is a new and promising approach for healthy
   lifestyle management.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify key components of
   self-tracking and persuasive eCoaching in automated healthy lifestyle
   interventions that contribute to their effectiveness on health outcomes,
   usability, and adherence. A secondary aim was to identify the way in
   which these key components should be designed to contribute to improved
   health outcomes, usability, and adherence.
   Methods: The scoping review methodology proposed by Arskey and O'Malley
   was applied. Scopus, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and PubMed were searched for
   publications dated from January 1, 2013 to January 31, 2016 that
   included (1) self-tracking, (2) persuasive eCoaching, and (3) healthy
   lifestyle intervention.
   Results: The search resulted in 32 publications, 17 of which provided
   results regarding the effect on health outcomes, 27 of which provided
   results regarding usability, and 13 of which provided results regarding
   adherence. Among the 32 publications, 27 described an intervention. The
   most commonly applied persuasive eCoaching components in the described
   interventions were personalization (n=24), suggestion (n=19),
   goal-setting (n=17), simulation (n=17), and reminders (n=15). As for
   self-tracking components, most interventions utilized an accelerometer
   to measure steps (n=11). Furthermore, the medium through which the user
   could access the intervention was usually a mobile phone (n=10). The
   following key components and their specific design seem to influence
   both health outcomes and usability in a positive way: reduction by
   setting short-term goals to eventually reach long-term goals,
   personalization of goals, praise messages, reminders to input
   self-tracking data into the technology, use of validity-tested devices,
   integration of self-tracking and persuasive eCoaching, and provision of
   face-to-face instructions during implementation. In addition, health
   outcomes or usability were not negatively affected when more effort was
   requested from participants to input data into the technology. The data
   extracted from the included publications provided limited ability to
   identify key components for adherence. However, one key component was
   identified for both usability and adherence, namely the provision of
   personalized content.
   Conclusions: This scoping review provides a first overview of the key
   components in automated healthy lifestyle interventions combining
   self-tracking and persuasive eCoaching that can be utilized during the
   development of such interventions. Future studies should focus on the
   identification of key components for effects on adherence, as adherence
   is a prerequisite for an intervention to be effective.}},

Title = {{Quantifying Human Movement Using the Movn Smartphone App: Validation and
   Field Study}},
Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: The use of embedded smartphone sensors offers opportunities
   to measure physical activity (PA) and human movement. Big data-which
   includes billions of digital traces-offers scientists a new lens to
   examine PA in fine-grained detail and allows us to track people's
   geocoded movement patterns to determine their interaction with the
   environment.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the validity of
   the Movn smartphone app (Moving Analytics) for collecting PA and human
   movement data.
   Methods: The criterion and convergent validity of the Movn smartphone
   app for estimating energy expenditure (EE) were assessed in both
   laboratory and free-living settings, compared with indirect calorimetry
   (criterion reference) and a stand-alone accelerometer that is commonly
   used in PA research (GT1m, ActiGraph Corp, convergent reference). A
   supporting cross-validation study assessed the consistency of activity
   data when collected across different smartphone devices. Global
   positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer data were integrated with
   geographical information software to demonstrate the feasibility of
   geospatial analysis of human movement.
   Results: A total of 21 participants contributed to linear regression
   analysis to estimate EE from Movn activity counts (standard error of
   estimation {[}SEE]=1.94 kcal/min). The equation was cross-validated in
   an independent sample (N=42, SEE=1.10 kcal/min). During laboratory-based
   treadmill exercise, EE from Movn was comparable to calorimetry
   (bias=0.36 {[}-0.07 to 0.78] kcal/min, t82=1.66, P=.10) but
   overestimated as compared with the ActiGraph accelerometer (bias=0.93
   {[}0.58-1.29] kcal/min, t89=5.27, P<.001). The absolute magnitude of
   criterion biases increased as a function of locomotive speed (F1,4=7.54,
   P<.001) but was relatively consistent for the convergent comparison
   (F1,4=1.26, P<.29). Furthermore, 95\% limits of agreement were
   consistent for criterion and convergent biases, and EE from Movn was
   strongly correlated with both reference measures (criterion r=.91,
   convergent r=.92, both P<.001). Movn overestimated EE during free-living
   activities (bias=1.00 {[}0.98-1.02] kcal/min, t(6123)=101.49, P<.001),
   and biases were larger during high-intensity activities
   (F-3,F-6120=1550.51, P<.001). In addition, 95\% limits of agreement for
   convergent biases were heterogeneous across free-living activity
   intensity levels, but Movn and ActiGraph measures were strongly
   correlated (r=.87, P<.001). Integration of GPS and accelerometer data
   within a geographic information system (GIS) enabled creation of
   individual temporospatial maps.
   Conclusions: The Movn smartphone app can provide valid passive
   measurement of EE and can enrich these data with contextualizing
   temporospatial information. Although enhanced understanding of
   geographic and temporal variation in human movement patterns could
   inform intervention development, it also presents challenges for data
   processing and analytics.}},

   reconstruction technique}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{87-94}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Compression algorithm is an essential part of Telemedicine systems, to
   store and transmit large amount of medical signals. Most of existing
   compression methods utilize fixed transforms such as discrete cosine
   transform (DCT) and wavelet and usually cannot efficiently extract
   signal redundancy especially for non-stationary signals such as
   electroencephalogram (EEG). In this paper, we first propose
   learning-based adaptive transform using combination of DCT and
   artificial neural network (ANN) reconstruction technique. This adaptive
   ANN-based transform is applied to the DCT coefficients of EEG data to
   reduce its dimensionality and also to estimate the original DCT
   coefficients of EEG in the reconstruction phase. To develop a new near
   lossless compression method, the difference between the original DCT
   coefficients and estimated ones are also quantized. The quantized error
   is coded using Arithmetic coding and sent along with the estimated DCT
   coefficients as compressed data. The proposed method was applied to
   various datasets and the results show higher compression rate compared
   to the state-of-the-art methods.}},

Title = {{Sugarsquare, a Web-Based Patient Portal for Parents of a Child With Type
   1 Diabetes: Multicenter Randomized Controlled Feasibility Trial}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Raising a child with type 1 diabetes (T1D) means combining
   the demands of the disease management with everyday parenting, which is
   associated with increased levels of distress. A Web-based patient
   portal, Sugarsquare, was developed to support parents, by providing
   online parent-professional communication, online peer support and online
   disease information.
   Objective: The first aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of
   conducting a multicenter, randomized controlled trial in Dutch parents
   of a child with T1D. The second aim was to assess the feasibility of
   implementing Sugarsquare in clinical practice.
   Methods: The parents of 105 children (N=105) with T1D below the age of
   13 participated in a 6-month multicenter randomized controlled
   feasibility trial. They were randomly assigned to an experimental (n=54,
   usual care and Sugarsquare) or a control group (n=51, usual care).
   Attrition rates and user statistics were gathered to evaluate
   feasibility of the trial and implementation. To determine potential
   efficacy, the parenting stress index (PSI-SF) was assessed at baseline
   (T0) and after 6 months (T1).
   Results: Of a potential population of parents of 445 children, 189 were
   willing to participate (enrollment refusal=57.5\%, n=256), 142 filled in
   the baseline questionnaire (baseline attrition rate=25\%, n=47), and 105
   also filled in the questionnaire at T1 (post randomization attrition
   rate during follow-up=26\%, n=32). As such, 24\% of the potential
   population participated. Analysis in the experimental group (n=54)
   revealed a total of 32 (59\%) unique users, divided into 12 (38\%)
   frequent users, 9 (28\%) incidental users, and 11 (34\%) low-frequent
   users. Of the total of 44 professionals, 34 (77\%) logged in, and 32
   (73\%) logged in repeatedly. Analysis of the user statistics in the
   experimental group further showed high practicability and integration in
   all users, moderate acceptability and demand in parents, and high
   acceptability and demand in health care professionals. Baseline
   parenting stress index scores were related to the parents' frequency of
   logging on (rho=.282, P=.03) and page-views (rho=.304, P=.01). No
   significant differences in change in parenting stress between
   experimental and control group were found (F-3,F-101=.49, P=.49).
   Conclusions: The trial can be considered feasible, considering the
   average enrollment refusal rate, baseline attrition rate and
   postrandomization attrition rate, compared to other eHealth studies,
   although lower than hypothesized. Implementing Sugarsquare in clinical
   practice was partly feasible, given moderate demand and acceptability in
   parent users and lack of potential efficacy. Parents who reported higher
   levels of parenting stress used Sugarsquare more often than other
   parents, although Sugarsquare did not reduce parenting stress. These
   results indicate that Web-based interventions are a suitable way of
   providing parents of children with T1D with additional support. Future

Title = {{Parent-Mediated Intervention Training Delivered Remotely for Children
   With Autism Spectrum Disorder Living Outside of Urban Areas: Systematic
   Review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Parent training programs for families living outside of
   urban areas can be used to improve the social behavior and communication
   skills in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, no
   review has been conducted to investigate these programs.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to (1) systematically review the
   existing evidence presented by studies on parent-mediated intervention
   training, delivered remotely for parents having children with ASD and
   living outside of urban areas; (2) provide an overview of current parent
   training interventions used with this population; (3) and provide an
   overview of the method of delivery of the parent training interventions
   used with this population.
   Methods: Guided by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews
   and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement, we conducted a comprehensive
   review across 5 electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, ERIC, PsycINFO,
   and Pubmed) on July 4, 2016, searching for studies investigating
   parent-mediated intervention training for families living outside of
   urban centers who have a child diagnosed with ASD. Two independent
   researchers reviewed the articles for inclusion, and assessment of
   methodological quality was based on the Kmet appraisal checklist.
   Results: Seven studies met the eligibility criteria, including 2 prepost
   cohort studies, 3 multiple baseline studies, and 2 randomized controlled
   trials (RCTs). Interventions included mostly self-guided websites: with
   and without therapist assistance (n=6), with training videos, written
   training manuals, and videoconferencing. Post intervention, studies
   reported significant improvements (P<.05) in parent knowledge (n=4),
   parent intervention fidelity (n=6), and improvements in children's
   social behavior and communication skills (n=3). A high risk of bias
   existed within all of the studies because of a range of factors
   including small sample sizes, limited use of standardized outcome
   measures, and a lack of control groups to negate confounding factors.
   Conclusions: There is preliminary evidence that parent-mediated
   intervention training delivered remotely may improve parent knowledge,
   increase parent intervention fidelity, and improve the social behavior
   and communication skills for children with ASD. A low number of RCTs,
   difficulty in defining the locality of the population, and a paucity of
   standardized measures limit the generalization of the findings to the
   target population. Future studies should investigate the appropriateness
   and feasibility of the interventions, include RCTs to control for bias,
   and utilize standard outcome measures.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the emergence of hyperchaos in a network with two very
   simple discrete periodic oscillators is presented. Uncoupled periodic
   oscillators may represent, in the crudest and simplest form, periodic
   oscillators in nature, for example fireflies, crickets, menstrual cycles
   of women, among others. Nevertheless, the emergence of hyperchaos in
   this kind of real-life network has not been proven. In particular, we
   focus this study on the emergence of hyperchaotic dynamics, considering
   that these can be mainly used in engineering applications such as
   cryptography, secure communications, biometric systems, telemedicine,
   among others. In order to corroborate that the emerging dynamics are
   hyperchaotic, some chaos and hyperchaos verification tests are
   conducted. In addition, the presented hyperchaotic coupled system
   synchronizes, based on the proposed coupling scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives We determined headache patients' satisfaction with
   telemedicine and assessed how telemedicine influenced headache burden,
   compliance with diagnosis and treatment, and need for follow-up
   consultations.
   Methods During 2.5 years, patients from Northern Norway referred with
   non-acute headaches for a specialist consultation at TromsO University
   Hospital were consecutively randomised to either telemedicine or
   traditional visits. Baseline data were recorded and compared to data
   from a three-month follow-up questionnaire (see Supplementary material).
   The following were evaluated: (1) satisfaction with the consultation;
   (2) headache status; subjective improvement, average pain intensity,
   treatment, headache days per month, and Headache Impact Test (HIT-6);
   and (3) treatment compliance and follow-up visits.
   Results Out of 402 consultations, 348 (86.6\%) answered the
   questionnaire. Satisfaction was similar in the telemedicine and the
   traditional group (88.8\% vs. 92.3\%; p=0.35). Subgroup analyses were
   not prespecified, but there were no differences in satisfaction among
   females, migraineurs, rural patients and urban patients. Improvement
   from baseline after three months was reported equally in the
   telemedicine and the traditional groups. There were also no differences
   in treatment compliance, but rural telemedicine patients had
   less-frequent headache visits at three months' follow-up (28.9\% vs.
   48.7\%, p=0.002).
   Conclusion Telemedicine is non-inferior to traditional consultations in
   patient satisfaction, specialist evaluation, and treatment of non-acute
   headaches. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02270177.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Smoking increases the risk of complications associated with orthopaedic
   trauma surgery, however delivery of care is low. Online interventions
   may provide needed smoking cessation care and promote abstinence. This
   study aims to examine the engagement, acceptability, and retention of an
   online smoking cessation program (Smoke-Free Recovery; SFR) among a
   sample of orthopaedic trauma patients, as well as themes around the
   smoking cessation process. A pilot study of SFR with 31 orthopaedic
   trauma patients admitted to a public hospital in New South Wales,
   Australia took place. Semi-structured telephone interviews were
   conducted following hospital discharge. Thematic analysis and
   descriptive statistics were used. Engagement was high with 28
   participants accessing SFR during admission. Twenty individuals
   completed follow-up phone calls. Program acceptability was rated
   favourably. After discharge, changes in smoking habits were noted, with
   program retention low. Themes on program use included: lack of time or
   need for additional support; computer illiteracy or technology issues;
   feeling unready or too stressed to quit; or feeling they had reached the
   boundary of what could be learnt from the program. This study highlights
   the difficulties faced by patients following hospital admission, the
   lack of follow-up support received, and the need for consumer testing
   prior to roll out. Continuing to develop interventions to promote
   hospital-initiated cessation attempts that continue post-discharge
   should be a priority.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Access to specialist services is limited by wait times and
   geographic availability. Champlain Building Access to Specialist Advice
   (BASE) has been implemented in our service region to facilitate access
   to specialists by primary care providers (PCPs). Through a secure
   web-based system, PCPs are able to send eConsults instead of requesting
   a formal in-office consultation.
   Methods: Urology eConsults completed through the Champlain BASE service
   from March 2013 to January 2015 were analyzed. Each consult was
   characterized in regard to the type of question asked by the referring
   physician and the clinical content of the referral. Using the mandatory
   close-out surveys, we analyzed rates of referral avoidance, physician
   satisfaction, and overall impact on patient care.
   Results: Of 190 eConsultations, 70\% were completed in less than 10
   minutes. The most common clinical questions related to the
   interpretation of imaging reports (16\%) and tests to choose for
   investigating a condition (15\%). The most common diagnoses were
   hematuria (13\%) and renal mass (8\%). In 35\% of cases, referral to a
   urologist had originally been contemplated and was avoided. In 8\% of
   cases, a PCP did not believe a consultation was initially needed, but a
   referral was ultimately initiated after the eConsultation.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that although certain clinical
   presentations still require a formal in-person urological consultation,
   eConsultations can potentially reduce unnecessary clinic visits while
   identifying patients who may benefit from early urological consultation.
   Through both these mechanisms, we may improve timely access to
   urologists.}},

Abstract = {{American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) veterans living in rural areas
   have unique health care needs and face numerous barriers to accessing
   health care services. Among these needs is a disproportionate prevalence
   of posttraumatic stress disorder and other mental illnesses. Since 2001,
   14 rural communities have partnered with the U.S. Department of Veterans
   Affairs and the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health at
   the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to extend telemental
   health clinics to American Indian veterans. Administrative and, to some
   extent, clinical considerations of these clinics have been reviewed
   previously. This paper describes a model of care, evolved over a 14-year
   period, that weaves together evidence-based Western treatment,
   traditional Native healing, and rural Native communities into 4 main
   components: mental health care, technology, care coordination, and
   cultural facilitation. We delineate improvements to care made by
   addressing barriers such as system transference, provider-patient trust,
   and videoconferencing. Similarly, the discussion notes ways that the
   care model leverages strengths within Native communities, such as social
   cohesion and spirituality. Future steps include selection of appropriate
   performance indicators for systematic evaluation. The identification of
   key constructs of this care model will facilitate comparisons with other
   models of care in underserved populations with chronic and complex
   health conditions, and eventually advance the state of care for our
   warriors.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the efficacy of technology-assisted case management
   (TACM) with medication titration by nurses using guideline-based
   algorithms, under physician supervision in improving glycemic control in
   low-income rural adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. Research
   Design and Methods: Adults (aged >= 18 years) from the southeastern
   United States with hemoglobin A1c {[}HbA1c] >= 8\% were randomized to
   TACM or usual care. Evidence-based guidelines were used to develop
   medication titration algorithms in conjunction with clinic physicians.
   Participants were given a telehealth device that uploaded blood glucose
   and blood pressure readings daily to a central server. A nurse case
   manager was trained on the algorithms and authorized to titrate
   medications every 2 weeks based on the algorithm under the supervision
   of an internist and an endocrinologist. Participants were assessed at
   baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome was HbA1c at
   6-months postrandomization in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.
   Results: One hundred thirteen participants were randomized to either
   TACM intervention or usual care. Based on ITT population after multiple
   imputation, the analysis of covariance with baseline HbA1c as covariate
   showed that HbA1c at 6 months for TACM was significantly lower compared
   to the usual care group (-0.99, P = 0.024). Moreover, longitudinal mixed
   effects analysis suggested that the rate of decline in HbA1c over time
   for TACM was significantly faster compared to the usual care group
   (-0.16, P = 0.038). Results based on per-protocol population were
   similar.
   Conclusions: Technology-assisted case management by a nurse with
   medication titration under physician supervision is efficacious in
   improving glycemic control in low-income rural adults with poorly
   controlled type 2 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Background To determine the feasibility and efficacy of a retinal
   telephotocoagulation treatment plan for diabetic macular edema.
   Methods Prospective, interventional cohort study at two clinical sites.
   Sixteen eyes of ten subjects with diabetic macular edema underwent
   navigated focal laser photocoagulation using a novel teleretinal
   treatment plan. Clinic 1 (King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh,
   Saudi Arabia) collected retinal images and fundus fluorescein angiogram.
   Clinic 2 (Palmetto Retina Center, West Columbia, SC, USA) created
   image-based treatment plans based on which macular laser
   photocoagulation was performed back at clinic 1. The primary outcome of
   the study was feasibility of image transfer and performing navigated
   laser photocoagulation for subjects with diabetic macular edema between
   two distant clinics. Secondary measures were change in best-corrected
   visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) by
   spectral-domain optical coherence tomography at 3 months after
   treatment.
   Results The teleretinal treatment plan was able to be successfully
   completed in all 16 eyes. The mean logMAR BCVA at baseline was 0.49 +/-
   0.1, which remained stable (0.45 +/- 0.1) 3 months after treatment (p =
   0.060). The CRT improved from 290.1 +/- 37.6 mu m at baseline to 270.8
   +/- 27.7 mu m 3 months after treatment (p = 0.005). All eyes
   demonstrated improvement in the area of retinal edema after laser
   photocoagulation, and no eyes demonstrated visual acuity loss 3 months
   after treatment.
   Conclusion This study introduces the concept of retinal
   telephotocoagulation for diabetic macular edema, and demonstrates the
   feasibility and safety of using telemedicine to perform navigated
   retinal laser treatments regardless of geographical distance.}},

Title = {{The Effectiveness of Remote Facilitation in Simulation-Based Pediatric

Abstract = {{Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of pediatric simulation by
   remote facilitation. We hypothesized that simulation by remote
   facilitation is more effective compared to simulation by an on-site
   facilitator. We defined remote facilitation as a facilitator remotely
   (1) introduces simulation-based learning and simulation environment, (2)
   runs scenarios, and (3) performs debriefing with an on-site facilitator.
   Methods: A remote simulation program for medical students during
   pediatric rotation was implemented. Groups were allocated to either
   remote or on-site facilitation depending on the availability of
   telemedicine technology. Both groups had identical 1-hour simulation
   sessions with 2 scenarios and debriefing. Their team performance was
   assessed with behavioral assessment tool by a trained rater. Perception
   by students was evaluated with Likert scale (1-7).
   Results: Fifteen groups with 89 students participated in a simulation by
   remote facilitation, and 8 groups with 47 students participated in a
   simulation by on-site facilitation. Participant demographics and
   previous simulation experience were similar. Both groups improved their
   performance from first to second scenario: groups by remote simulation
   (first {[}8.5 +/- 4.2] vs second {[}13.2 +/- 6.2], P = 0.003), and
   groups by on-site simulation (first {[}6.9 +/- 4.1] vs second {[}12.4
   +/- 6.4], P = 0.056). The performance improvement was not significantly
   different between the 2 groups (P = 0.94). Faculty evaluation by
   students was equally high in both groups (7 vs 7; P = 0.65).
   Conclusions: A pediatric acute care simulation by remote facilitation
   significantly improved students' performance. In this pilot study,
   remote facilitation seems as effective as a traditional, locally
   facilitated simulation. The remote simulation can be a strong
   alternative method, especially where experienced facilitators are
   limited.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To systematically review the scientific literature regarding
   tele-rheumatology and draw conclusions about feasibility, effectiveness,
   and patient satisfaction.
   Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane database searches were performed
   (April 2016) using relevant MeSH and keyword terms for telemedicine and
   rheumatic diseases. Articles were selected if reporting outcomes for
   feasibility, effectiveness, and patient satisfaction and
   methodologically appraised using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for
   assessing risk of bias and a modified version of CONSORT 2010 Statement.
   Results: A total of 177 articles were screened, 23 were selected for the
   present review but only 9 were RCTs. Five studies reported on
   feasibility, 14 effectiveness, and 9 satisfaction rates for different
   tele-rheumatology interventions grouped in synchronous (remotely
   delivered consultation) and asynchronous (remote disease activity
   assessment; tele-monitoring of treatment strategies or rehabilitation;
   and remotely delivered self-management programs). Seven studies (30.4\%)
   were on rheumatoid arthritis, 2 (8.7\%) were on systemic sclerosis (1
   including also rheumatoid arthritis patients), 5 (21.7\%) on
   fibromyalgia, 2 (8.7\%) on osteoarthritis, 3 (13.0\%) on juvenile
   idiopathic arthritis and 4 (17.4\%) on mixed disease cohorts.
   Interventions and outcomes heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis of
   results. Overall, feasibility and patient satisfaction rates were high
   or very high across intervention types. Effectiveness was equal or
   higher than standard face-to-face approach in controlled trials which,
   however, were affected by small sample size and lack of blinding
   participants according to appraisal tools.
   Conclusion: Telemedicine may provide a well-accepted way to remotely
   deliver consultation, treatment and monitoring disease activity in
   rheumatology. Higher quality RCTs demonstrating effectiveness of
   different tele-rheumatology interventions are needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background. As colon cancer is increasingly becoming a chronic illness
   with a broad range of symptoms, there is a need for individually
   tailored care for these patients.
   Objective. To investigate patients' opinions about GP involvement in
   survivorship care and the use of eHealth applications, such as
   Oncokompas(2.0), to support self-management. Oncokompas(2.0) is an
   interactive website that monitors quality of life via
   participant-reported outcomes and provides feedback and personalized
   supportive care.
   Methods. We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured
   interviews with patients diagnosed with stages I-III colon cancer
   treated with curative intent. Twenty participants (nine men, age range
   49-86 years) were recruited in five Dutch hospitals by purposive
   sampling. Thematic data analysis was done by two coders.
   Results. Possible benefits of greater GP involvement include better
   accessibility of care and additional guidance. Participants considered
   an increased workload for the already busy GP as a disadvantage.
   Requirements for greater GP involvement were assurance of sufficient
   knowledge and expertise of the GP and easy access to secondary care.
   Most participants expected that Oncokompas(2.0) would increase awareness
   of symptoms and concerns and provide more insight into support
   possibilities. Reservations mentioned were the expected loss of personal
   contact with health professionals and the feasibility of implementation
   in the total patient population.
   Conclusion. Colon cancer patients see some benefit of greater GP
   involvement and the use of Oncokompas(2.0) to improve survivorship care.
   Our study results support initiatives to further explore GP-led
   survivorship care and the implementation of eHealth.}},

   Johannesburg, South Africa, were examined. An otologist performed
   otomicroscopy and a general practitioner performed otoscopy.
   Video-otoscopy was performed by a health care facilitator and video
   sequences were stored on a server for assessment by the same general
   practitioner 4 and 8 weeks later. At all examinations, a diagnosis was
   set and the tympanic membrane appearance was graded using the
   OMgrade-scale. The otologist's otomicroscopic diagnosis was set as
   reference standard to compare the accuracy of the two otoscopic methods.
   Results: Diagnostic agreement between otologist's otomicroscopic
   examination and the general practitioner's otoscopic examination was
   substantial (kappa 0.66). Agreement between onsite otomicroscopy and the
   general practitioners asynchronous video assessments were also
   substantial (kappa 0.70 and 0.80).
   Conclusion: Video-otoscopy performed by a health care facilitator and
   assessed asynchronously by a general practitioner had similar or better
   accuracy compared to face-to-face otoscopy performed by a general
   practitioner.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although the use of telepractice in speechlanguage therapy
   for assessment purposes is well documented, its effectiveness and
   potential for rehabilitation in poststroke aphasia remain largely
   unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness
   of a remotely delivered synchronous pragmatic telespeech language
   therapy for improving functional communication in aphasia.
   Methods: A pre-/post-test design was chosen in which each participant
   was his or her own control. Using a telerehabilitation platform and
   software (Oralys TeleTherapy) based on the Promoting Aphasics'
   Communicative Effectiveness (PACE) approach, 20 participants with
   chronic poststroke aphasia received 9 speech therapy sessions over a
   3-week period.
   Results: Teletreatment with the PACE pragmatic rehabilitation approach
   led to improvements in functional communication, marked by (a) an
   increase in communication effectiveness, reflecting significantly
   improved autonomy in functional communication; (b) a decrease in
   communication exchange duration, meaning that the treatment made
   communication faster and more efficient; (c) a decrease in the number of
   communication acts, meaning that, after treatment, less information was
   needed to be efficiently understood by the communication partner; and
   (d) an increase in the number of different communication strategies
   used, meaning that the treatment fostered the use of a variety of
   alternative communication modes.
   Conclusions: This study provides additional arguments about the benefits
   of telerehabilitation for poststroke patients with aphasia. It showed
   that multimodal language therapy delivered through synchronous
   telerehabilitation had positive effects on functional communication in
   chronic aphasia.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Millions of U.S. adults suffer from chronic pain with a high
   prevalence of comorbid mental health issues. Telehealth-delivered
   behavioral therapy for chronic pain has been evaluated in the research
   setting. The purpose of this study was 1) to describe a nationally
   scaled, standardized, telebehavioral therapy program for patients with
   chronic pain and behavioral comorbidities, and 2) evaluate
   characteristics, goals, and psychosocial outcomes among program
   participants.
   Materials and Methods: This was mixed-methods retrospective cohort
   analysis among consecutive program graduates (mean age 53y; 24\% male).
   The 8-week program was delivered by a licensed therapist and a behavior
   coach through telephone/secure video and tailored to each participant's
   behavioral health needs and goals. Participant chief complaints,
   behavioral goals, and mood triggers were abstracted by deidentified
   clinical record review using structured qualitative research methods.
   Depression, anxiety, and stress symptom data were collected at baseline
   and program graduation using the validated Depression Anxiety Stress
   Scales 21.
   Results: Back pain (42\%) and hip/leg/knee pain (28\%) comprised the
   most common chief complaints. Pain management (44\%) and weight loss
   (43\%) were the most frequently cited goals. At baseline, approximately
   half of participants had elevated depression (59\%), anxiety (54\%),
   and/or stress (48\%) scores. Triggers for depressed, anxious, or
   stressed mood included severe pain (47\%), health concerns (46\%), and
   interpersonal relationship challenges (45\%). At graduation, significant
   improvement in median depression (-54\%), anxiety (-50\%), and stress
   (-33\%) symptom scores was observed among those with non-normal baseline
   values (p < 0.001); degree of improvement did not vary by participant
   age or sex.
   Conclusions: Participants in a nationally scaled telebehavioral health
   program for chronic pain experienced significant improvement in
   depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and shared several complaints,
   goals, and mood triggers.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Shared-risk models encourage providers to engage young
   patients early. Telemedicine may be well suited for younger, healthier
   patients although it is unclear how best to incorporate telemedicine
   into routine clinical care.
   Introduction: We test the assumptions surrounding the use of
   telemedicine, younger and rising-risk patients, and primary care in
   ClickWell Care (CWC), a care model developed at our institution for our
   own accountable care organization.
   Materials and Methods: CWC's team of physicians and wellness coaches
   work together to provide comprehensive primary care through in-person,
   phone, and video visits. This study examines usage of the clinic over
   its initial year in operation.
   Results: 1,464 unique patients conducted a total of 3,907 visits. 2,294
   (58.7\%) visits were completed virtually (1,382 {[}35.4\%] by phone and
   912 {[}23.3\%] by video). Patients were more inclined to see the
   physician in-person for a new visit (1,065 visits {[}70.5\%] vs. 362
   {[}24\%] phone and 83 {[}6\%] video) and more likely to see the
   physician virtually for a return visit (606 {[}43.2\%] phone and 249
   {[}17.7\%] video vs. 548 {[}39.1\%] in-person), a statistically
   significant difference (X-2 = 306.7, p < 0.00001).
   Conclusion: This new care model successfully engaged a younger
   population of patients. However, our data suggest young patients may not
   be inclined to establish care with a primary care physician virtually
   and, in fact, choose an initial in-person touch point, although many are
   willing to conduct return visits virtually. This new model of care could
   have a large impact on how care is delivered to low-and rising-risk
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: For a cloud-based telecardiology solution to be
   established in any scenario, it is necessary to ensure optimum levels of
   security, as patient's data will not be in the same place from where
   access is gained. The main objective of this article is to present a
   secure, cloud-based solution for a telecardiology service in different
   scenarios: a hospital, a health center in a city, and a group of health
   centers in a rural area.
   Methods: iCanCloud software is used to simulate the scenarios. The first
   scenario will be a city hospital with over 220,000 patients at its
   emergency services, and similar to 1 million outpatient consultations.
   For the health center in a city, it serves similar to 107,000 medical
   consultations and 16,700 pediatric consultations/year. In the last
   scenario, a group of health centers in a rural area serve an average
   437.08 consultations/month and around 15.6 a day.
   Results: Each one of the solutions proposed shares common features
   including the following: secure authentication through smart cards, the
   use of StorageGRID technology, and load balancers. For all cases, the
   cloud is private and the estimated price of the solution would cost
   around 450 e/month.
   Conclusions: Thanks to the research conducted in this work, it has been
   possible to provide an adapted solution in the form of a telecardiology
   service for a hospital, city health center, and rural health centers
   that offer security, privacy, and robustness, and is also optimum for a
   large number of cloud requests.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients in rural communities lack access to acute stroke
   therapies. Rapid administration of lytic therapy increases the
   likelihood of favorable functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke
   (AIS). At the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), we
   implemented a Web-based telestroke program that allows patients
   presenting with AIS at a rural hospital to receive expert stroke
   consultation within minutes. This increases their chances of receiving
   lytic therapy, and therefore increases the likelihood of good functional
   outcome.
   Objectives: Our study aims to provide an update on how our telestroke
   program had developed and the rate and safety of intravenous (IV)
   alteplase administration through telestroke.
   Methods: Data were collected on all patients evaluated through the MUSC
   Telestroke program from May 2008 through April 2014. Collected data
   included National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on
   presentation, number of IV alteplase administrations, number of patients
   transferred to MUSC, number of mechanical thrombectomies performed on
   transferred patients, rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages
   (sICHs), and discharge location.
   Results: A total of 7,694 consults were performed during the study
   period. Of them 3,795 (49.2\%) patients were diagnosed with ischemic
   stroke, of those 1,324 (34.8\%) received IV alteplase. A total of 1,282
   patients were transferred to MUSC for further care. From November 2014
   to April 2016, 56 patients received mechanical thrombectomy. sICH
   occurred in 33 patients who received alteplase, and in 5 patients
   receiving a combination of IV and intraarterial thrombolysis. Over the
   study period, the number of participating sites increased from 6 to 19
   sites. The percentage of transfers to MUSC decreased from 36\% to 14\%.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that our telestroke program had evolved
   over time to involve more sites throughout the state of South Carolina.
   Post-IV alteplase sICH was low and within the expected range.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is little research comparing dermatologist and patient
   satisfaction with in-person, store-and-forward, and live interactive
   examinations.
   Objective: To compare satisfaction with in-person examinations to
   store-and-forward and live interactive consultations having two types of
   video.
   Methods: A controlled study was conducted where patients referred for
   dermatology consultations were examined inperson, by video, and by
   store-and-forward methods. Video changed between compressed and
   uncompressed on alternate clinics. Patients and dermatologists rated
   encounters after each examination. Dermatologists doing
   store-and-forward evaluations rated the quality of information provided.
   After experiencing all methods patients ranked their preferences.
   Dermatologists ranked their preferences at the end of the study.
   Results: In-person examinations were preferred by both patients and
   dermatologists. Overall, satisfaction with teledermatology was still
   high. Patients were evenly divided in preferring store-and-forward
   workups or live interactive video. Dermatologists were also divided on
   store-and-forward and uncompressed video, but tended toward the latter.
   Compressed video was the least preferred method among dermatologists.
   Limitations: Dermatology residents took store-and-forward photos and
   their quality was likely superior to those normally taken in practice.
   Conclusions: Patients and dermatologists prefer in-person examinations
   and diverge on preferring store-and-forward and live interactive when
   video is not compressed. The amount of video compression that can be
   applied without noticeable image degradation is a question for future
   research.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In the spirit of Dr. Haggerty's teachings, we present an overview of our
   work to improve care for children with asthma in the context of 3
   lessons learned: 1) the importance of providing integrated services
   across disciplinary boundaries for children with chronic illness, 2) the
   need to move from a care model focused only on the individual child to a
   model focused on the child, family, and community, and 3) the need to
   expand beyond the local community and take a broad perspective on
   improving health on a national level. The goal of our program is to
   develop sustainable models to overcome the multiple obstacles to
   effective preventive care for urban children with asthma. The primary
   intervention for our original School-Based Asthma Therapy program was
   directly observed administration of preventive asthma medications in
   school (with dose adjustments on the basis of National Heart, Lung, and
   Blood Institute guidelines). We found that children who received
   preventive medications in school through directly observed therapy had
   improved outcomes across mul-tiple outcome measures. Our subsequent
   asthma programs have focused on dissemination and sustainability, with
   the incorporation of communication technology to enhance the system of
   care. We are currently testing the `School-Based Telemedicine Enhanced
   Asthma Management' program, including 400 children with persistent
   asthma from the Rochester City School District. This program includes
   directly observed administration of preventive asthma medication at
   school, and school-based telemedicine to assure appropriate evaluation,
   preventive medication prescription, and follow-up care. It is designed
   to implement and sustain guideline-based asthma care through existing
   community infrastructure, and could serve as a model for the integration
   of services in rural as well as urban communities.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{541-554}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Neuropsychology has fallen reliant on outdated and labor intensive
   methods of data collection that are slow, highly inefficient, and
   expensive, and provide relatively data-poor estimates of human behavior
   despite rapid technological advance in most other fields of medicine.
   Here we present a brief historical overview of current testing practices
   in an effort to frame the current crisis, followed by an overview of
   different settings in which technology can and should be integrated.
   Potential benefits of laboratory based assessments, remote assessments,
   as well as passive and high-frequency data collection tools rooted in
   technology are discussed, along with several relevant examples and how
   these technologies might be deployed. Broader issues of data security
   and privacy are discussed, as well as additional considerations to be
   addressed within each setting. Some of the historical barriers to
   adoption of technology are also presented, along with a brief discussion
   of the remaining uncertainties. While by no means intended as a
   comprehensive review or prescriptive roadmap, our goal is to show that
   there are a tremendous number of advantages to technologically driven
   data collection methods, and that technology should be embraced by the
   field. Our predictions are that the comprehensive assessments of the
   future will likely entail a combination of lab-based assessments, remote
   assessments, and passive data capture, and leading the development of
   these efforts will cement the role of neuropsychology at the forefront
   of cognitive and behavioral science.}},

Title = {{Strategic framework improves access to stroke reperfusion across the

Journal = {{INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Background: In 2010, rapid access to stroke thrombolysis centres was
   limited in some regional areas in the Australian state of Victoria.
   These results, and planning for endovascular clot retrieval (ECR), have
   led to the implementation of strategies by the Victorian Stroke Clinical
   Network, the Victorian Stroke Telemedicine Program and local health
   services to improve state-wide access.
   Aims: To examine whether access to stroke reperfusion services
   (thrombolysis and ECR) in regional Victoria have subsequently improved.
   Methods: The locations of suspected stroke patients attended by
   ambulance in 2015 were mapped, and drive times to the nearest
   reperfusion services were calculated. We then calculated the proportion
   of cases with transport times within: (i) 60 min to thrombolysis
   centres; and (ii) 180 min to two ECR centres designated to receive
   regional patients. Statistical comparisons to existing 2010 data were
   made.
   Results: In 2015, Ambulance Victoria attended 16 418 cases of suspected
   stroke (2.9\% of all emergency calls), of whom 4597 (28\%) were located
   in regional Victoria. Compared to 2010, a greater proportion of regional
   suspected stroke patients in 2015 were located within 60 min of a
   thrombolysis centre by road (77-95\%, P < 0.001). A 3-h road travel time
   to the two ECR centres is currently possible for 88\% of regional
   patients.
   Conclusion: A strategic and region-specific approach has resulted in
   improved access by road transport to reperfusion therapies for stroke
   patients across Victoria.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Perioperative, maternity, and newborn nurses discovered a
   solution using modern technology to facilitate earlier ``connection''
   between postcesarean section mothers and their newborns using televised
   video conference (VC) or telemedicine. Videoconferencing used as a
   support in cases of separation after childbirth can facilitate a first
   ``meeting'' closer to the time of birth.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to design and validate the use of video
   conferencing to facilitate ``bonding'' between postdelivery cesarean
   delivery mothers who are separated from their infants.
   Design: Mixed quantitative and qualitative.
   Method: Mothers (n=29) completed questionnaires investigating immediate
   postpartum needs for communication with their newborns. Questionnaire
   analysis revealed the primary need is connection and communication. The
   nursing team developed a VC system between postanesthesia care unit and
   newborn unit including nurse-mother instruction. Mothers (n=10) were
   qualitatively queried regarding their VC experience.
   Results: When prioritizing, mothers found the most important need is to
   see the infant. Eight themes were found: revelation, calming effect,
   closer look at the baby, video better than picture, excitement,
   short-timing sufficient, provision of strength, and confidence.
   Conclusion: The nursing team successfully coordinated new technologies
   to the hospital setting to fulfill mothers' needs. After evaluation of
   mothers' impressions, it was found that this technology is adaptable to
   hospital setting and postdelivery environment. Most importantly, this
   method contributes to improved well-being for postpartum mothers.}},

Title = {{A descriptive survey of cancer helplines in the United Kingdom: Who they
   are, the services offered, and the accessibility of those services}},
Journal = {{PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: There are more than 1500 UK health helplines in operation,
   yet we have scant knowledge about the resources in place to support the
   seeking and delivering of cancer-related telephone help and support.
   This research aimed to identify and describe cancer and cancer-related
   helpline service provision: the number of helplines available, the
   variety of services provided, and the accessibility of those services.
   Method: This study used online national questionnaire survey sent to 95
   cancer and cancer-related helplines in the United Kingdom.
   Results: A total of 69 (73\%) of 95 surveyed cancer and cancer-related
   helplines completed the survey. Most helplines/organizations were
   registered charities, supported by donations; 73.5\% of helplines had
   national coverage. Most helplines served all age-groups, ethnic groups,
   and men and women. Only 13.4\% had a number that was free from landlines
   and most mobile networks, and 56.6\% could only be contacted during
   working hours. More than 50\% of helplines reported no provisions for
   callers with additional needs, and 55\% had no clinical staff available
   to callers. Ongoing support and training for helpline staff was
   available but variable.
   Conclusion: Although cancer helplines in the United Kingdom offer
   reasonably broad coverage across the country, there are still potential
   barriers to accessibility. There are also opportunities to optimize the
   training of staff/volunteers across the sector. There are further
   prospects for helplines to enhance services and sustain appropriate and
   realistic quality standards.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Web-based medical service (WBMS), a cooperative relationship
   between medical service and Internet technology, has been called one of
   the most innovative services of the 21st century. However, its business
   promotion and implementation in the medical industry have neither been
   expected nor executed. Few studies have explored this phenomenon from
   the viewpoint of inexperienced patients.
   Objective: The primary goal of this study was to explore whether
   technology attractiveness, medical creditability, and diversified
   medical information sources could increase users' behavior intention.
   Methods: This study explored the effectiveness of web-based medical
   service by using three situations to manipulate sources of medical
   information. A total of 150 questionnaires were collected from people
   who had never used WBMS before. Hierarchical regression was used to
   examine the mediation and moderated-mediation effects.
   Results: Perceived ease of use (P=.002) and perceived usefulness
   (P=.001) significantly enhance behavior intentions. Medical credibility
   is a mediator (P=.03), but the relationship does not significantly
   differ under diverse manipulative information channels (P=.39).
   Conclusions: Medical credibility could explain the extra variation
   between technology attractiveness and behavior intention, but not
   significant under different moderating effect of medical information
   sources.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing transition to digital technology is also a challenge for
   the treatment management of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DMT1) in children
   and adolescents and prospectively will have a great influence on
   diabetes care. Diabetes technology has developed enormously over the
   past years. Treatment of DMT1 is associated with a daily flood of data
   (e.g. blood glucose, carbohydrate and insulin monitoring); therefore,
   telemedicine is a chance to analyze real-time data. Consequently, the
   analysis of real-time data by algorithms will enable personalized
   diabetes management. It requires an increasing comprehension of its
   application by diabetes teams, patients and their families. Digital
   transmission of real-time data associated with telemedicine are
   important factors in modern diabetes care. With the application of new
   diabetes technologies, e.g. insulin pumps, continuous glucose
   measurement (CGM) and closed loop systems, there is an increasing need
   for diabetes education and individual coaching to optimize the complex
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Telemedical support and networking between health personnel and medical
   specialists also increases the quality of prehospital emergency care -
   as is many other areas of medicine. However, telemedical services have
   been only used to date for specific illnesses. Therefore, a worldwide
   unique, comprehensive telemedicine system was developed in Aachen as an
   additional feature for existing ground and airborne rescue systems. It
   can be used for the complete prehospital emergency care program.
   After clarification of legal aspects, testing, and further technical
   enhancement, the system was implemented in the emergency medical
   services in Aachen and financed by health insurance. It has been
   implemented as part of routine emergency care since 1 April 2014. The
   system, composed of hard- and software components (telephysician work
   station, server infastructure, a mobile unit and transmission box
   installed in the ambulance) ensures the availability in secure real-time
   data transfer (of speech, vital parameters, photos, video stream,
   12-lead ECG, etc.).
   After more than 5000 rescue missions initially as part of the
   preliminary research and now regular care, clear indications and limits
   can derived.
   Telemedicine-assisted emergency missions can be managed safely and have
   better quality of documentation, guideline conform therapy, reduced
   medical interaction time by about more than 50\%, reduced number of
   missions requiring a physician escort and has at least an equivalent
   quality of care.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on telemedicine implementation, which can be used to
   extend modern medical knowledge to remote areas in developing countries.
   By examining doctor-patient interactions in the context of a
   telemedicine program in India, we posit how the behaviour of the actors
   interacting over virtual media is determined by interplay between two
   dominant institutional logics, namely logic of care and logic of choice.
   The paper draws on the tenets of institutional logics to extend the
   theoretical understanding about processes of engagement of actors with a
   new technology and explicates how the engagement evolves with the use of
   technology. The research emphasizes the essential role of considering
   the dynamics of logic of care and logic of choice in the design and
   implementation process.}},

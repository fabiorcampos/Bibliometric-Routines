Abstract = {{In affective computing, stress recognition mainly focuses on the
   relation of stress and photoelectric information. Researchers have used
   artificial intelligence to determine stress and computer identification
   channels. However, in applications such as health and security,
   Emotional stress (ES) information is usually to be alongside physical
   stress (PS) information, making it urgent to classify ES and PS. The
   thermal signals of ES and PS have yet to be classified, for which,
   signal amplification is offered. In this study, we propose a
   classification algorithm based on signal amplification and correlation
   analysis called Eulerian magnification-canonical correlation analysis.
   This signal amplification algorithm expands the signals of ES and PS in
   different frequency domains. Sparse coding and canonical correlation
   analysis then fuse the original signal and its amplified features. The
   extracted entropy features are used to train the correlation weight
   between ES and PS, which formulates stress classifications. The new
   classification method achieves an accuracy rate of 90\%. This study can
   lead to a practical system for the noninvasive assessment of stress
   states for health or security applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In face of staggering traffic growth driven by cloud-based platforms,
   modern optical networks-forming the backbone of such connectivity-are
   faced with increasing requirements in terms of operational reliability.
   The challenge is that of cognition-driven learning and fault management
   workflows, cost-effectively assuring the next-generation networks.
   Machine learning, an artificial intelligence tool, can be conceived as
   an extremely promising instrument to address network assurance via
   dynamic data-driven operation, as opposed to static pre-engineered
   solutions. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a cognitive fault
   detection architecture for intelligent network assurance. We introduce
   the concept of cognitive fault management, elaborate on its integration
   in transport software defined network controller, and demonstrate its
   operation based on real-world fault examples. Our framework both detects
   and identifies significant faults, and outperforms conventional fixed
   threshold-triggered operations, both in terms of detection accuracy and
   proactive reaction time.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objective: Pulmonary tuberculosis is a world emergency
   for the World Health Organization. Techniques and new diagnosis tools
   are important to battle this bacterial infection. There have been many
   advances in all those fields, but in developing countries such as
   Colombia, where the resources and infrastructure are limited, new fast
   and less expensive strategies are increasingly needed. Artificial neural
   networks are computational intelligence techniques that can be used in
   this kind of problems and offer additional support in the tuberculosis
   diagnosis process, providing a tool to medical staffto make decisions
   about management of subjects under suspicious of tuberculosis.
   Materials and methods: A database extracted from 105 subjects with
   precarious information of people under suspect of pulmonary tuberculosis
   was used in this study. Data extracted from sex, age, diabetes,
   homeless, AIDS status and a variable with clinical knowledge from the
   medical personnel were used. Models based on artificial neural networks
   were used, exploring supervised learning to detect the disease.
   Unsupervised learning was used to create three risk groups based on
   available information.
   Results: Obtained results are comparable with traditional techniques for
   detection of tuberculosis, showing advantages such as fast and low
   implementation costs. Sensitivity of 97\% and specificity of 71\% where
   achieved.
   Conclusions: Used techniques allowed to obtain valuable information that
   can be useful for physicians who treat the disease in decision making
   processes, especially under limited infrastructure and data. (C) 2018

Title = {{An artificial immune network to control interrupted flow at a signalized
   intersection}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{433}},
Pages = {{70-95}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{To monitor and control interrupted flow at signalized intersections,
   several Traffic Signal Control Systems (TSCSs) were developed based on
   optimization and artificial intelligence techniques. Although learning
   can provide intelligent ways to deal with disturbances, existing
   approaches still lack concepts and mechanisms that enable direct
   representation of knowledge and explicit learning, particularly to
   capture and reuse previous experiences with disturbances. This article
   addresses this gap by designing a new TSCS based on innovative concepts
   and mechanisms borrowed from biological immunity. Immune memory enables
   the design of a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) System in which cases provide
   a direct representation of knowledge about disturbances. Immune network
   theory enables the design of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) mechanism to
   interconnect cases, capture explicit knowledge about the outcomes
   (success and failure) of control decisions and enable decision-making by
   taking advantage of previous outcomes in reaction to new occurrences of
   disturbances. We provide a detailed description of new learning
   algorithms, both to create the case-base and to interconnect cases using
   RL. The performance of the suggested TSCS is assessed by benchmarking it
   against two standard control strategies from the literature, namely
   fixed-time and adaptive control using the Longest Queue First - Maximal
   Weight Matching (LQF-MWM) algorithm. The suggested TSCS is applied on an
   intersection simulated using VISSIM, a state-of-the-art traffic
   simulation software. The results show that the suggested TSCS is able to
   handle different traffic scenarios with competitive performance, and
   that it is recommended for extreme situations involving blocked
   approaches and high traffic flow. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Portfolio optimization (PO) has been catching more and more attention in
   the artificial intelligence and the machine learning communities. In
   this paper, we propose a novel Trend Representation based Log density
   Regularization (TRLR) system for portfolio optimization. Its novelty
   falls into two aspects. First, it introduces a log-density
   regularization to the increasing factor of portfolio, which is seldom
   addressed by previous PO systems. It reflects a relationship between the
   portfolio and the price relative at an equilibrium point. Second, TRLR
   exploits a novel trend representation by taking the time variable as
   regressor in a weighted ridge regression, hence TRLR captures price
   trend patterns effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on 5
   benchmark datasets from real-world financial markets demonstrate that
   TRLR achieves significantly better performance than other
   state-of-the-art strategies and runs fast, which shows its effectiveness
   and efficiency for large-scale applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Argumentation has provided a means to deal with inconsistent knowledge.
   We explore the potential of argumentation to handle conflicting user
   preferences. Classical preference handling methods in Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) lack the ability to handle ambiguity and the evolution
   of preferences over time. Previous experiments conducted by the authors
   indicate the usefulness of argumentation systems to handle Ambient
   Intelligence (AmI) examples with the aforementioned characteristics.
   This paper explores a generalized framework that can be applied to
   handle user preferences in AmI. The paper provides an overall preference
   handling architecture which can be used to extend current argumentation
   systems. We show how the proposed system can handle multiple users with
   the introduction of personalized preference functions. We illustrate how
   user preferences can be handled in realistic ways in AmI environments
   (such as smart homes), by showing how the system can make decisions
   based on inhabitants' preferences on lighting, healthy eating and

Abstract = {{Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used over the past years
   to solve many different artificial intelligence (AI) problems, providing
   significant advances in some domains and leading to state-of-the-art
   results. However, the topologies of CNNs involve many different
   parameters, and in most cases, their design remains a manual process
   that involves effort and a significant amount of trial and error.
   In this work, we have explored the application of neuroevolution to the
   automatic design of CNN topologies, introducing a common framework for
   this task and developing two novel solutions based on genetic algorithms
   and grammatical evolution. We have evaluated our proposal using the
   MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition, achieving a result that
   is highly competitive with the state-of-the-art without any kind of data
   augmentation or preprocessing. When misclassified samples are carefully
   observed, it is found that most of them involve handwritten digits that
   are difficult to recognize even by a human. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we proposed a new artificial bee colony-based spectrum
   handoff algorithm for wireless cognitive radio systems. In our wireless
   cognitive radio system, primary users, secondary users, and related base
   stations exist in the same communication environment. For our artificial
   bee colony-based algorithm, secondary users that always struggle to
   discover an idle channel have a leading role. While honey bees work hard
   to find the best-quality nectar source for foraging, secondary users try
   to find idle channels for making communication. In this way, secondary
   users are organized for different missions such as sensing and handoff
   similar to honey bees to minimize spectrum handoff delay by working
   together. In the spectrum handoff stage, some secondary users must sense
   the spectrum so that the interrupted secondary user may perform the
   spectrum handoff process. In our developed spectrum handoff algorithm,
   the spectrum availability characteristic is observed on the basis of the
   missions of the bees in the artificial bee colony algorithm with the aim
   of minimizing the spectrum handoff delay and maximizing probability of
   finding an idle channel. With the help of the algorithm that is
   developed using the artificial bee colony, spectrum handoff delay of
   secondary users is considerably decreased for different number of users
   without reducing probability of finding an available channel.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of the material from which an object is made is of
   significant value for effective robotic grasping and manipulation.
   Characteristics of the material can be retrieved using different sensory
   modalities: vision based, tactile based or sound based. Compressibility,
   surface texture and thermal properties can each be retrieved from
   physical contact with an object using tactile sensors. This paper
   presents a method for collecting data using a biomimetic fingertip in
   contact with various materials and then using these data to classify the
   materials both individually and into groups of their type. Following
   acquisition of data, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to
   extract features. These features are used to train seven different
   classifiers and hybrid structures of these classifiers for comparison.
   For all materials, the artificial systems were evaluated against each
   other, compared with human performance and were all found to outperform
   human participants' average performance. These results highlighted the
   sensitive nature of the BioTAC sensors and pave the way for research
   that requires a sensitive and accurate approach such as vital signs
   monitoring using robotic systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the potential of using a novel Hermite
   polynomial neural network to model shoreline realignment along an urban
   beach fronted by a highly irregular beachrock reef. Modeling takes place
   on the basis of a number of input variables related to reef morphology
   and wave forcing, whereas the output variable is time series of
   shoreline position that have been recorded in high spatio-temporal
   resolution using a coastal video monitoring system. The main network
   functionality is the generation of Hermite truncated polynomial series
   of linear combinations of the input variables, and output is calculated
   as the weighted sum of these truncated series. It is shown that the
   proposed network can approximate any continuous function defined on a
   compact set of the multidimensional Euclidean space to arbitrary
   accuracy. The network is optimized in terms of a modified artificial bee
   colony method. For comparative reasons, three more related neural
   networks have been tested that have been optimized by employing
   different swarm intelligence-based algorithms. Comparison between the
   four networks has been carried out by standard performance criteria and
   detailed parametric statistical analysis. Main results of the study are:
   (a) polynomial orders 3 and 4 are able to effectively handle reasonably
   well the high nonlinear effects imposed by the presence of the reef; (b)
   the statistical analysis indicates that the proposed network outperforms
   the other networks tested; and (c) model efficiency improves noticeably
   when beach sections behind reef inlets and/or particular wide sections
   of the reef that introduce high shoreline variability are not
   considered. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a patient-safe approach for
   imaging applications and is a promising technology for biomedical
   imaging. By applying a small electrical current to living tissue and
   measuring the electrical potential at different points of the tissue's
   boundary, it is possible to solve the inverse problem and to generate a
   map of the tissue's conductivities. Although it is a promising method,
   the reconstruction process remains a complicated task, and real-time
   nonlinear image reconstruction algorithms have not yet been widely
   adopted. Recent studies have proposed the use of artificial neural
   networks (ANN) to solve the EIT inverse problem. ANNs can give a
   nonlinear conductivity distribution. Although several studies have
   examined 2-D finite-element models, very little work has been done on
   3-D problems. In this paper, a solution based on the divide-and-conquer
   method and ANNs is used to solve the nonlinear inverse problem without
   any linearization. The solution presented here reduces the difficulty of
   training large ANNs, which are commonly required to solve a 3-D EIT
   problem with artificial intelligence algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum decision theory, advanced earlier by the authors, and
   illustrated for lotteries with gains, is generalized to the games
   containing lotteries with gains as well as losses. The mathematical
   structure of the approach is based on the theory of quantum
   measurements, which makes this approach relevant both for the
   description of decision making of humans and the creation of artificial
   quantum intelligence. General rules are formulated allowing for the
   explicit calculation of quantum probabilities representing the fraction
   of decision makers preferring the considered prospects. This provides a
   method to quantitatively predict decision-maker choices, including the
   cases of games with high uncertainty for which the classical expected
   utility theory fails. The approach is applied to experimental results
   obtained on a set of lottery gambles with gains and losses. Our
   predictions, involving no fitting parameters, are in very good agreement
   with experimental data. The use of quantum decision making in game
   theory is described. A principal scheme of creating quantum artificial
   intelligence is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Building a reliable prediction model can mitigate the need for actual
   experiments, hence saving time and cost. To this end, this study
   presents a methodology to predict weld quality for a particular friction
   stir weld configuration using machine learning and metaheuristic
   algorithms including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), fuzzy KNN (FKNN), and the
   artificial bee colony (ABC). The ABC algorithm was utilized to determine
   the best (F)KNN model with optimal K value and feature subset. First,
   models were built based on only experimental conditions including
   spindle rotational speed, plunge force, and feed rate, as well as
   derived values including a speed ratio and an empirical force index
   (EFI). The best model was identified to be 1-NN comprised of three
   features, i.e., rotational speed, feed rate, and EFI, with 93.16\%
   classification accuracy based on leave-one-out cross-validation. The
   majority of data points leading to error were found to lie mostly on the
   boundaries between classes. It was shown that classification error could
   be reduced by removing those points, which is cheating and not
   recommended. Instead, it is recommended to improve classification
   accuracy without omitting dissenting data by introducing additional
   information to better distinguish misclassified data points. To this
   end, wavelet energy features extracted from weld signals of X-Force,
   Y-Force, spindle rotational speed, feed rate, and plunge force were
   added to the original feature pool. In order to determine the impact of
   each weld signal feature set, each signal feature set was individually
   tested. After applying ABC to the expanded feature pool to build the
   best model, perfect classification accuracy was achieved in several
   cases. The results suggest that adding signal features can greatly
   improve the effectiveness of model predictability of friction stir weld
   quality.}},

Title = {{Predicting failures in agile software development through data analytics}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{49-66}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Artificial intelligence-driven software development paradigms have been
   attracting much attention in academia, industry and the government. More
   specifically, within the last 5 years, a wave of data analytics is
   affecting businesses from all domains, influencing engineering
   management practices in many industries and making a difference in
   academic research. Several major software vendors have been adopting a
   form of ``intelligent{''} development in one or more phases of their
   software development processes. Agile for example, is a well-known
   example of a lifecycle used to build intelligent and analytical systems.
   The agile process consists of multiple sprints; in each sprint a
   specific software feature is developed, tested, refined and documented.
   However, because agile development depends on the context of the
   project, testing is performed differently in every sprint. This paper
   introduces a method to predict software failures in the subsequent agile
   sprints. That is achieved by utilizing analytical and statistical
   methods (such as using Mean Time between Failures and modelling
   regression). The novel method is called: analytics-driven testing (ADT).
   ADT predicts errors and their locations (with a certain statistical
   confidence level). That is done by continuously measuring MTBF for
   software components, and using a forecasting regression model for
   estimating where and what types of software system failures are likely
   to occur. ADT is presented and evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{According to The Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency, Brazil reached
   a loss of approximately U.S.\$4 billion in commercial losses during
   2011, which correspond to more than 27 000 GWh. The strengthening of the
   smart grid has brought a considerable amount of research that can be
   noticed, mainly with respect to the application of several artificial
   intelligence techniques in order to automatically detect commercial
   losses, but the problem of selecting the most representative features
   has not been widely discussed. In this paper, we make a parallel among
   the problem of commercial losses in Brazil and the task of irregular
   consumers characterization by means of a recent meta-heuristic
   optimization technique called Black Hole Algorithm. The experimental
   setup is conducted over two private datasets (commercial and industrial)
   provided by a Brazilian electric utility, and it shows the importance of
   selecting the most relevant features in the context of theft
   characterization.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, distributed generations (DGs) and microgrids play a
   significant role in development of power systems, but DGs produce
   several protection problems especially in optimal coordination of
   directional overcurrent relays (DORs). Optimal coordination of DORs is a
   highly constrained nonlinear programming problem, which has attracted
   attention of many research studies in recent years. Cuckoo optimization
   algorithm (COA) is introduced as an optimization tool based on behavior
   patterns of Cuckoos. In this paper, COA and linear programming (LP) are
   combined as a new hybrid COA-LP optimization algorithm in order to
   optimize the coordination protection of DORs in microgrids and find the
   optimum value of fault current limiter at the point of common coupling.
   The optimum settings of DORs are obtained for both modes of operation:
   1) grid-connected and 2) island mode. The proposed algorithm is applied
   to Canadian distribution benchmark and a modified IEEE 14 bus networks
   and compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic
   algorithm (GA). The obtained results show that the computational
   efficiency of the proposed COA-LP is better than PSO and GA in terms of
   speed and total operating time of DORs.}},

   Meaning through Natural-Language Human-Robot Interaction}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{When using assistive systems, the consideration of individual and
   cultural meaning is crucial for the utility and acceptance of
   technology. Orientation, communication and interaction are rooted in
   perception and therefore always happen in material space. We understand
   that a major problem lies in the difference between human and technical
   perception of space. Cultural policies are based on meanings including
   their spatial situation and their rich relationships. Therefore, we have
   developed an approach where the different perception systems share a
   hybrid spatial model that is generated by artificial intelligence-a
   joint effort by humans and assistive systems. The aim of our project is
   to create a spatial model of cultural meaning based on interaction
   between humans and robots. We define the role of humanoid robots as
   becoming our companions. This calls for technical systems to include
   still inconceivable human and cultural agendas for the perception of
   space. In two experiments, we tested a first prototype of the
   communication module that allows a humanoid to learn cultural meanings
   through a machine learning system. Interaction is achieved by non-verbal
   and natural-language communication between humanoids and test persons.
   This helps us to better understand how a spatial model of cultural
   meaning can be developed.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, real-time facial expression recognition has attracted more and
   more research. In this study, an automatic facial expression real-time
   system was built and tested. Firstly, the system and model were designed
   and tested on a MATLAB environment followed by a MATLAB Simulink
   environment that is capable of recognizing continuous facial expressions
   in real-time with a rate of 1 frame per second and that is implemented
   on a desktop PC. They have been evaluated in a public dataset, and the
   experimental results were promising. The dataset and labels used in this
   study were made from videos, which were recorded twice from five
   participants while watching a video. Secondly, in order to implement in
   real-time at a faster frame rate, the facial expression recognition
   system was built on the field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The camera
   sensor used in this work was a Digilent VmodCAM - stereo camera module.
   The model was built on the Atlys (TM) Spartan-6 FPGA development board.
   It can continuously perform emotional state recognition in real-time at
   a frame rate of 30. A graphical user interface was designed to display
   the participant's video in real-time and two-dimensional predict labels
   of the emotion at the same time.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, the task of automatically generating image description
   has attracted a lot of attention in the field of artificial
   intelligence. Benefitting from the development of convolutional neural
   networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), many approaches
   based on the CNN-RNN framework have been proposed to solve this task and
   achieved remarkable process. However, two problems remain to be tackled
   in which the most existing methods use only the image-level
   representation. One problem is object missing, in which some important
   objects may he missing when generating the image description and the
   other is misprediction, when one object may be recognized in a wrong
   category. In this paper, to address these two problems, we propose a new
   method called global-local attention (GLA) for generating image
   description. The proposed GLA model utilizes an attention mechanism to
   integrate object-level features with image-level feature. Through this
   manner, our model can selectively pay attention to objects and context
   information concurrently. Therefore, our proposed GLA method can
   generate more relevant image description sentences and achieve the
   state-of-the-art performance on the well-known Microsoft COCO caption
   dataset with several popular evaluation metrics-CIDEr, METEOR, ROUGE-L
   and BLEU-1, 2,3, 4.}},

Abstract = {{The deterioration in enterprises' profitability not only threatens the
   interests of those firms, but also means related parties (investors,
   bankers, and stakeholders) could encounter tremendous financial losses,
   which could also impact the circulation of limited economic resources.
   Thus, an enterprise risk forecasting mechanism is urgently needed to
   assist decision-makers in adjusting their operating strategies so as to
   survive under any highly turbulent economic climate. This research
   introduces a novel hybrid model that incorporates an incremental
   filter-wrapper feature subset selection with the statistical examination
   and twin support vector machine (IFWTSVM) for enterprise operating
   performance forecasting. To promote a hybrid model's real-life
   application, the knowledge visualization extracted from IFWTSVM is
   represented in an easy-to-grasp style. The experimental results reveal
   that IFWTSVM's forecasting quality is very promising for financial risk
   mining, relative to other forecasting techniques examined in this study.}},

Abstract = {{We compare different epistemic notions in the presence of awareness of
   propositional variables: the logic of implicit knowledge (in which
   explicit knowledge is definable), the logic of explicit knowledge, and
   the logic of speculative knowledge. Speculative knowledge is a novel
   epistemic notion that permits reasoning about unawareness. These logics
   are interpreted on epistemic awareness models: these are multi-agent
   Kripke structures for propositional awareness (in each state an agent
   may only be aware of formulas containing occurrences of a subset of all
   propositional variables). Different notions of bisimulation are suitable
   for these logics. We provide correspondence between bisimulation and
   modal equivalence on image-finite models for these logics. Expressivity
   and axiomatizations are cinvestigated for models without restrictions,
   and for models with equivalence relations for all agents (modeling
   knowledge) and awareness introspection (agents know what they are aware
   of). We show that the logic of speculative knowledge is as expressive as
   the logic of explicit knowledge, and the logic of implicit knowledge is
   more expressive than the two other logics. We also present expressivity
   results for more restricted languages. We then provide and compare
   axiomatizations for the three logics; the axiomatizations for
   speculative knowledge are novel. We compare our results to those for
   awareness achieved in artificial intelligence, computer science,
   philosophy, and economics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Decentralized Reinforcement Reinforcement Learning of Robot Behaviors}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{256}},
Pages = {{130-159}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A multi-agent methodology is proposed for Decentralized Reinforcement
   Learning (DRL) of individual behaviors in problems where
   multi-dimensional action spaces are involved. When using this
   methodology, sub-tasks are learned in parallel by individual agents
   working toward a common goal. In addition to proposing this methodology,
   three specific multi agent DRL approaches are considered:
   DRL-Independent, DRL Cooperative Adaptive (CA), and DRL-Lenient. These
   approaches are validated and analyzed with an extensive empirical study
   using four different problems: 3D Mountain Car, SCARA Real-Time
   Trajectory Generation, Ball-Dribbling in humanoid soccer robotics, and
   Ball Pushing using differential drive robots. The experimental
   validation provides evidence that DRL implementations show better
   performances and faster learning times than their centralized
   counterparts, while using less computational resources. DRL-Lenient and
   DRL-CA algorithms achieve the best final performances for the four
   tested problems, outperforming their DRL-Independent counterparts.
   Furthermore, the benefits of the DRLLenient and DRL-CA are more
   noticeable when the problem complexity increases and the centralized
   scheme becomes intractable given the available computational resources
   and training time. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Safety engineering of computational cognitive architectures within
   safety-critical systems}},
Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the integration of a cognitive architecture with an
   intelligent decision support model (IDSM) that is embedded into an
   autonomous non-deterministic safety critical system. The IDSM will
   integrate multi criteria decision making via intelligent technologies
   like expert systems, fuzzy logic, machine learning and genetic
   algorithms.
   Cognitive technology is currently simulated in safety critical systems
   to highlight variables of interest, interface with intelligent
   technologies, and provide an environment that improves a system's
   cognitive performance. In this study, the IDSM is being applied to an
   actual safety critical system, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with
   embedded artificial intelligence (AI) software. The USV's safety
   performance is being researched in a simulated and a real world nautical
   based environment. The objective is to build a dynamically changing
   model to evaluate a cognitive architecture's ability to ensure safe
   performance of an intelligent safety critical system. The IDSM does this
   by finding a set of key safety performance parameters that can be
   critiqued via safety measurements, mechanisms and methodologies. The
   uniqueness of this research will be on bounding the decision making
   associated with the cognitive architecture's key safety parameters
   (KSP).
   Other real-time applications that could benefit from advancing the
   safety of cognitive technologies are unmanned platforms, transportation
   technologies, and service robotics. The results will provide cognitive
   science researchers a reference for safety engineering artificially
   intelligent safety critical systems.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{147-156}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Software bugs are prevalent and fixing them is time consuming, and
   therefore troubleshooting is an important part of software engineering.
   This paper presents a novel paradigm for incorporating Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) in the modern software troubleshooting process that
   can drastically reduce troubleshooting costs. In this paradigm, which we
   call Learn, Diagnose, and Plan (LDP), we integrate three AI
   technologies: (1) machine learning: learning from source-code structure,
   revisions history and past failures, which software components are more
   likely to contain bugs, (2) automated diagnosis: identifying the
   software components that need to be modified in order to fix an observed
   bug, and (3) automated planning: planning additional tests when such are
   needed to improve diagnostic accuracy. Importantly, these AI
   technologies are integrated in LDP in a synergistic manner: the
   diagnosis algorithm is modified to consider the learned fault
   predictions and the planner is modified to consider the possible
   diagnoses outputted by the diagnosis algorithm. The overall solution is
   demonstrated on real faults observed in four open source software
   projects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There has been continuous research in the energy distribution sector
   because of its huge impact on modern societies. Nonetheless, aerial high
   voltage power lines are still supported by old transmission towers which
   involve some serious risks. Those risks may be avoided with periodic and
   expensive reviews. The main objective of this work is to reduce the
   number of these periodic reviews so that the maintenance cost of power
   lines is also reduced. More specifically, the work is focused on
   reducing the number of periodic reviews of transmission towers to avoid
   step and touch potentials, which are very dangerous for humans. A
   virtual organization-based multi-agent system is proposed in conjunction
   with different artificial intelligence methods and algorithms. The
   developed system is able to propose a sample of transmission towers from
   a selected set to be reviewed. The system ensures that the whole set
   will have similar values without needing to review all the transmission
   towers. As a result of this work, a website application is provided to
   manage all the review processes and all the transmission towers of
   Spain. It allows the companies that review the transmission towers to
   initiate a new review process for a whole line or area, while the system
   indicates the transmission towers to review. The system is also able to
   recommend the best place to locate a new transmission tower or the best
   type of structure to use when a new transmission tower must be used.}},

Abstract = {{Current practice for the design of an urban water system usually relies

   how granular data generated by an intelligent water management system

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the concept and framework of smart operating system
   based on the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The demands and
   the potential applications of AI technologies in power system control
   centers is discussed in the beginning of the paper. The discussion is
   based on the results of a field study in the Tianjin Power System
   Control Center in China. According to the study, one problem in power
   systems is that the power system analysis system in the control center
   is not fast and powerful enough to help the operators in time to deal
   with the incidents in the power system. Another issue in current power
   system control center is that the operation tickets are compiled
   manually by the operators, so that it is less efficient and human errors
   cannot be avoided. Based on these problems, a framework of the smart
   operating robot is proposed in this paper, which includes an intelligent
   power system analysis system and a smart operation ticket compiling
   system to solve the two problems in power system control centers. The
   proposed framework is mainly based on the AI techniques, especially the
   neural network with deep learning, since it is faster and more capable
   of dealing with the highly nonlinear and complex power system.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a research work on speaker discrimination
   using a multi-classifier fusion with focus on feature reduction effects.
   Speaker discrimination consists in the automatic distinction between two
   speakers using the vocal characteristics of their speeches. A number of
   features are extracted using Mel Frequency Spectral Coefficients and
   then reduced using Relative Speaker Characteristic (RSC) along with the
   Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Several classification methods are
   implemented to ensure the discrimination task. Since different
   classifiers are employed, two fusion algorithms at the decision level,
   referred to as Weighted Fusion and Fuzzy Fusion, are proposed to boost
   the classification performances. These algorithms are based on the
   weighting of the different classifiers outputs. Furthermore, the effects
   of speaker gender and feature reduction on the speaker discrimination
   task have been examined too. The evaluation of our approaches was
   conducted on a subset of Hub-4 Broadcast-News. The experimental results
   have shown that the speaker discrimination accuracy is improved by
   5-15\% using the (RSC-PCA) feature reduction. In addition, the proposed
   fusion methods recorded an improvement of about 10\% compared to the
   individual scores of the classifiers. Finally, we noticed that the
   gender has an important impact on the discrimination performances.}},

Abstract = {{In financial distress analysis, the diagnosis of firms at risk for
   bankruptcy is crucial in preparing to hedge against any financial damage
   the at-risk firms stand to inflict. Some pre-alarm signals that indicate
   a potential financial crisis exist when a firm faces a default risk.
   Early studies on corporate bankruptcy prediction include parametric and
   nonparametric approaches, such as artificial intelligence (AI), for
   detecting pre-alarm signals. Among nonparametric techniques, the methods
   involving support vector machine (SVM) have shown potential in
   predicting corporate bankruptcy. We propose a hybrid method that
   combines data depths and nonlinear SVM for the prediction of corporate
   bankruptcy. We employed data depth functions to condense multivariate
   financial data with nonlinear and non-normal characteristics into
   one-dimensional space. The SVM method was introduced to classify the
   data points on a depth versus depth plot (DD-plot). Based on data set
   that records failed and non-failed manufacturing firms in Korea over 10
   years, the empirical results demonstrated that the proposed method
   offers a higher level of accuracy in corporate bankruptcy prediction
   than existing methods. The proposed method is expected to provide a
   guidance in corporate investing for investors or other interested
   parties.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the task of reading comprehension style answer
   sentence selection that aims to select the best sentence from a given
   passage to answer a question. Unlike most previous works that match the
   question and each candidate sentence separately, we observe that the

   role in this task. We propose modeling context information with
   hierarchical gated recurrent neural networks. Specifically, we first
   apply a word level recurrent neural network to model the context
   independent matching between the question and each candidate sentence.
   We then employ a sentence level recurrent neural network to incorporate
   the context information among all candidate sentences. Moreover, we
   introduce the gate mechanism to select matching information before
   feeding into recurrent neural networks at both word and sentence level.
   Experiments on the WikiQA and SQuAD datasets show that our model
   outperforms state-of-the-art methods.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Moisture marks (wet areas) are significant defects that may develop on
   the surfaces of subway structures as a result of water leakage through
   soil. The detection and assessment of moisture marks are predominantly
   conducted on the basis of visual inspection (VI) methods, which are
   known to be costly, labor-intensive, and error-prone. The objective of
   this paper is to develop an integrated model based on image processing
   techniques and artificial intelligence to automate consistent moisture
   marks detection and numerical representation of the distress in subway
   networks. The integrated model comprises sequential processors that
   automatically detect moisture marks on concrete surfaces, and artificial
   neural networks (ANNs) for moisture marks identification and
   quantification. First, red-green-blue (RGB) images are preprocessed by
   means of spatial domain filters to denoise the image and enhance the
   crucial clues associated with moisture marks. Second, a moisture
   detector is streamlined with a set of morphological algorithms to detect
   wet areas. Third, the area percentage and severity of moisture marks are
   measured using the ANN model in conjunction with cross-entropy
   optimization function. The integrated model was validated through 165
   images. Regarding the moisture marks detection algorithm, the recall,
   precision, and accuracy attained were 93.2, 96.1, and 91.5\%,
   respectively. The mean and standard deviation of error percentage in
   moisture marks region extraction were 12.2 and 7.9\%, respectively.
   Also, the ANN model was able to satisfactorily quantify the moisture
   marks area with an average validity of 96\%. The integrated model is a
   decision support tool, expected to assist infrastructure managers and
   civil engineers in their future plans and decision making. (c) 2017

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Five hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) approaches based on machine
   learning (ML) and metaheuristic algorithms were proposed to predict open
   stope hangingwall (HW) stability. The ML algorithms consisted of
   logistic regression (LR), multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN),
   decision tree (DT), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and support vector
   machine (SVM), and the firefly algorithm (FA) was used to tune their
   hyperparameters. The objectives are to compare different hybrid AI
   approaches for HW stability prediction and investigate the relative
   importance of its influencing variables. Performance measures were
   chosen to be the confusion matrix, the receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) curve, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The results showed
   that the proposed hybrid AI approaches had great potential to predict HW
   stability and the FA was efficient in ML hyperparameters tuning. The AUC
   values of the optimum GBM, SVM, and LR models on the testing set were
   0.855, 0.816, and 0.801, respectively, denoting that their performance
   was excellent. The optimum GBM model with the top left cutoff or the
   Youden's cutoff was recommended for HW prediction in terms of the
   accuracy, the true positive rate and the AUC value. The relative
   importance of influencing variables on HW stability was obtained, in
   which stope design method was found to be the most significant variable.

Abstract = {{Blockchain acts on a big data analytics because transaction data belongs
   to streaming data and high-dimensional data from distributed computing

   because of inference mechanism. Our main goal is to reach traceability
   decision not consensus decision as fast as possible. Thus, this article
   proposes a novelty approach called Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy cognitive maps
   ANN as traceability chain algorithm. The numerical example of the
   proposed algorithm in blockchain mining is evaluated and optimized
   decisions experiment is analyzed. Objective functions for optimized
   decision computation is described as participant nodes constraint
   method. Thus contribution succeeds in meeting the reduction mining
   efforts for the traceability chain being processed. Our findings also

Abstract = {{Similarity (and distance metric) learning plays a very important role in
   many artificial intelligence tasks aiming at quantifying the relevance
   between objects. We address the challenge of learning complex relation
   patterns from data objects exhibiting heterogeneous properties, and
   develop an effective multi view multimodal similarity learning model
   with much improved learning performance and model interpretability. The
   proposed method firstly computes multi-view convolutional features to
   achieve improved object representation, then analyses the similarities
   between objects by operating over multiple hidden relation types
   (modalities), and finally fine-tunes the entire model variables via back
   -propagating a ranking loss to the convolutional layers. We develop a
   topic-driven initialization scheme, so that each learned relation type
   can be interpreted as a representative of semantic topics of the
   objects. To improve model interpretability and generalization, sparsity
   is imposed over these hidden relations. The proposed method is evaluated
   by solving the image retrieval task using challenging image datasets,
   and is compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms in the field.
   Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvement of
   the proposed method over the competing ones. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In recent years, credit scoring has become an efficient tool that allows
   financial institutions to differentiate their potential default
   borrowers. Accordingly, researchers have developed a myriad of
   approaches, including statistical and artificial intelligence
   techniques, to fulfill the task of credit scoring. Recent studies have
   shown that ensemble methods, which combine multiple algorithms that
   process different hypotheses to form a new hypothesis, generally
   outperform the other credit scoring approaches. In this paper, we
   propose a novel heterogeneous ensemble credit model that integrates the
   bagging algorithm with the stacking method. The proposed model differs
   from the extant ensemble credit models in three aspects, namely, pool
   generation, selection of base learners, and trainable fuser. Four
   popular evaluation metrics, including accuracy, area under the curve
   (AUC), AUC-H measure, and Brier score, are employed to measure the
   performance of alternative models. To confirm the efficiency of the
   proposed bstacking approach, a wide range of models, including
   individual classifiers, homogeneous ensemble model, and heterogeneous
   ensemble model, are introduced as benchmarks. We also provided a
   discussion on the accurate yet complex credit scoring model (e.g.,
   bstacking) from a regulatory perspective. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Sick children need a continuous monitoring, but this involves high costs
   for the government and for the parents. The use of information and
   communication technologies (ICT) jointly with artificial intelligence
   and smart devices can reduce these costs, help the children and assist
   their parents. This paper presents a smart architecture for children's
   chronic illness monitoring that will let the caregivers (parents,
   teachers and doctors) to remotely monitor the health of the children
   based on the sensors embedded in the smartphones and smart wearable
   devices. The proposed architecture includes a smart algorithm developed
   to intelligently detect if a parameter has exceeded a threshold, thus it
   may imply an emergency or not. To check the correct operation of this
   system, we have developed a small wearable device that is able to
   measure the heart rate and the body temperature. We have designed a
   secure mechanism to stablish a Bluetooth connection with the smartphone.
   In addition, the system is able to perform the data fusion in both the
   information packetizing process, which contributes to improve the
   protocol performance, and in the measured values combination, where it
   is used a stochastic approach. As a result, our system can fusion data
   from different sensors in real-time and detect automatically strange
   situations for sending a warning to the caregivers. Finally, the
   consumed bandwidth and battery autonomy of the developed device have
   been measured. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a novel wind turbine generator (WTG) imbalance fault
   classifier using gene expression programming (GEP). Proposed GEP fault
   classifier is able to achieve very high classification accuracy with
   relatively small number of samples. Ours is a first attempt at designing
   a WTG imbalance fault identifier using GEP for fault segregation. The
   identifier does not assume prior knowledge of WTG model. Raw current
   data of permanent magnet synchronous generator stator side are processed
   through empirical mode decomposition to generate 16 intrinsic mode
   functions or IMFs. Classifier employs the J48 algorithm to further prune
   these 16 IMFs to eight most relevant input variables which serve as
   inputs to the GEP imbalance fault classifier. The authors compare
   performance of the proposed GEP classifier with other contemporary
   artificial intelligence (AI) based classifiers such as neural networks
   and support vector machines. Simulation results and performance
   comparison against other AI approaches elucidate that the proposed
   GEP-based identifier could serve as an important tool for WTG fault

Abstract = {{Ranking historical players in sports is challenging since some players
   have never played against each other. It is even more complex in Go
   because of AlphaGo, a project based on artificial intelligence, who
   became the world's number 1 after it defeated the 528th and the 4th
   human Go players. AlphaGo is ranked high in the current Go ranking
   system because it is undefeated. The objective of this paper is to
   propose a new ranking method for large-scale Go players by means of
   incomplete fuzzy pair-wise comparison matrix whose priority vector is
   derived using a cosine similarity measure. Using match results provided
   by Go4Go.net, experiments are designed to rank top Go players in the
   past 45 years and examine the change in ranking after AlphaGo faced off
   against Jie Re. Furthermore, the proposed method was applied to rank all
   1544 Go players available at Go4Go.net to illustrate its efficiency in
   handling large-scale data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Dynamic Three-way Decision Model based on the Updating of Attribute
   Values}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{71-84}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{The three-way decision model is a topic of substantial research interest
   in the field of artificial intelligence, and many researchers have
   focused on to its feasibility and rationality. The tolerance and
   practicability of the three-way decision model are better than those of
   the two-way decision model. When the attribute value of each object in a
   domain is given, the formation of a three-way classification of the
   domain is a key issue. However, few studies have been conducted on
   establishing a three-way decision model with the given attribute values
   in the case where the number of objects in an accepted region is given.
   Therefore, in the model presented in this paper, both the uncertainty of
   attribute values and the cost of updating are fully considered. In this
   paper, first, a new concept of attribute ratio is defined to describe an
   object when the attribute value of the object is numerical, and then, a
   dynamic three-way decision model is established. Second, a feature
   extraction algorithm of attribute values is proposed, and a pair of
   decision thresholds of the dynamic three-way decision model is also
   obtained according to the given conditions. Then, in the case where the
   attribute values are updated, an example is provided to demonstrate how
   two-way classification results can be obtained in the dynamic
   decision-making process. Finally, the results of simulation experiments
   show that the proposed model is feasible and effective in practical
   applications. When the number of objects in an accepted region has been
   given, according to the updating strategy of attribute values, the
   three-way decision problems are successfully solved by the proposed
   model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies response selection for human-computer conversation
   systems. Existing retrieval based human-computer conversation systems
   are intended to reply to user utterances based on existing
   utterance-response pairs. However, collecting sufficient
   utterance-response pairs is intractable in practical situations,
   especially for many specific domains. We introduce DocChat a novel
   information retrieval approach for human-computer conversation systems
   that can use unstructured documents rather than semi-structured
   utterance-response pairs, to react to user utterances. The key of
   DocChat is a learning to rank model with features designed at various
   levels of granularity which is proposed to quantify the relevance
   between utterances and responses directly. We conduct comprehensive
   experiments on both sentence selection and real human-computer
   conversation scenarios. Empirical studies of sentence selection datasets
   shows reasonable improvements and the strong adaptability of our model.
   We compare DocChat with Xiaoice, a famous open domain chitchat engine in
   China. Side-by-side evaluation shows that DocChat is a good complement
   for human-computer conversation systems using utterance-response pairs
   as the primary source of responses. Furthermore, we release a large
   scale open-domain dataset for sentence selection which contains 304,413
   query-sentence pairs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{192-219}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an Immune Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (Immune
   GDE3) algorithm to solve dynamic multi- objective optimization problems
   (DMOPs) is empirically analyzed. Three main issues of the algorithm are
   explored: (1) the general performance of Immune GDE3 in comparison with
   other well-known algorithms, (2) its sensitivity to different change
   severities and frequencies, and (3) the role of its change reaction
   mechanism based on an immune response. For such purpose, four
   performance metrics, three unary and one binary, are computed in a
   comparison against other state-of-the-art dynamic multi-objective
   evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs) when solving a novel suite of test
   problems. A proposal for the adaptation of a binary metric, called
   Two-set-coverage, to evaluate the performance of DMOEAs is also
   presented in this paper. The statistically validated results indicate
   that Immune GDE3 is robust to change frequency and severity variations
   and can track the environmental change finding a good distribution of
   solutions. Finally, Immune GDE3 has a very competitive performance
   solving different types of DMOPs and this good performance is mainly
   attributed to its change reaction mechanism based on an immune response.
   Numerical results support such findings, showing that Immune GDE3
   obtains good results in all performance metrics, especially in the
   distribution metrics: Spacing(S) and Two-set-coverage(C-metric). (C)

Abstract = {{This Letter proposes a deep neural network (DNN) adaptation method,
   herein referred to as the hidden variability subspace (HVS) method, to
   achieve improved robustness under diverse acoustic environments arising
   due to differences in conditions, e.g. speaker, channel, duration and
   environmental noise. In the proposed approach, a set of
   condition-dependent parameters is estimated to adapt the hidden layer
   weights of the DNN in the HVS to reduce the condition mismatch. These
   condition-dependent parameters are then connected to various layers
   through a new set of adaptively trained weights. The authors evaluate
   the proposed hidden variability learning method on a language

Abstract = {{The explosive growth of data in volume, velocity and diversity that are
   produced by medical applications has contributed to abundance of big
   data. Current solutions for efficient data storage and management cannot
   fulfill the needs of heterogeneous data. Therefore, by applying
   computational intelligence (CI) approaches in medical data helps get
   better management, faster performance and higher level of accuracy in
   detection. This paper aims to investigate the state-of-the-art of
   computational intelligence approaches in medical data and to categorize
   the existing CI techniques, used in medical fields, as single and
   hybrid. In addition, the techniques and methodologies, their limitations
   and performances are presented in this study. The limitations are
   addressed as challenges to obtain a set of requirements for
   Computational Intelligence Medical Data (CIMD) in establishing an
   efficient CIMD architectural design. The results show that on the one
   hand Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Immune Recognition

Abstract = {{Biomedical question answering is a hot and challenging topic in
   artificial intelligence and natural language processing as it helps to
   analyze multiple, large, and fast-growing biomedical knowledge sources.
   Most researchers manage to address the problem through constructing a
   knowledge base but these approaches require much expertise as well as
   workload. In this paper, we propose a two-stage semantic sequential
   dependence model (SSDM2 ) framework based on a cognitive-inspired model
   and sequential dependence model (SDM) to answer biomedical questions
   with relevant snippets in academic papers. Concretely, we firstly search
   relevant articles and generate candidate snippets with a SSDM, which is
   proposed to integrate the semantic and sequential information within
   questions together. Afterwards, another SSDM is utilized to measure the
   relevances between the questions and corresponding candidate snippets
   and rank these snippets. A biomedical question answering system is
   constructed based on the proposed framework and evaluated on 3-year
   BioASQ 2013-15 benchmarks. Statistics indicate the proposed framework
   SSDM2 outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines and BioASQ
   participants. The proposed SSDM2 is an effective and robust framework
   for biomedical question answering.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, convolutional neural network models were developed to

   Several model architectures were trained, with the best performance
   reaching a 99.53\% success rate in identifying the corresponding
   {[}plant, disease] combination (or healthy plant). The significantly
   high success rate makes the model a very useful advisory or early

Abstract = {{How to automatically understand and answer users' questions (eg, queries
   issued to a search engine) expressed with natural language has become an
   important yet difficult problem across the research fields of
   information retrieval and artificial intelligence. In a typical
   interactive Web search scenario, namely, session search, to obtain
   relevant information, the user usually interacts with the search engine
   for several rounds in the forms of, eg, query reformulations, clicks,
   and skips. These interactions are usually mixed and intertwined with
   each other in a complex way. For the ideal goal, an intelligent search
   engine can be seen as an artificial intelligence agent that is able to
   infer what information the user needs from these interactions. However,
   there still exists a big gap between the current state of the art and
   this goal. In this paper, in order to bridge the gap, we propose a
   Markov random field-based approach to capture dependence relations among
   interactions, queries, and clicked documents for automatic query
   expansion (as a way of inferring the information needs of the user). An
   extensive empirical evaluation is conducted on large-scale web search
   data sets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale knowledge bases, as the foundations for promoting the
   development of artificial intelligence, have attracted increasing
   attention in recent years. These knowledge bases contain billions of
   facts in triple format; yet, they suffer from sparse relations between
   entities. Researchers proposed the path ranking algorithm (PRA) to solve
   this fatal problem. To improve the scalability of knowledge inference,
   PRA exploits random walks to find Horn clauses with chain structures to
   predict new relations given existing facts. This method can be regarded
   as a statistical classification issue for statistical relational
   learning (SRL). However, large-scale knowledge base completion demands
   superior accuracy and scalability. In this paper, we propose the path
   feature learning model (PFLM) to achieve this urgent task. More
   precisely, we define a two-stage model: the first stage aims to learn
   path features from the existing knowledge base and extra parsed corpus;
   the second stage uses these path features to predict new relations. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the PFLM can learn meaningful
   features and can achieve significant and consistent improvements
   compared with previous work.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Modal fixpoint logics traditionally play a central role in computer
   science, in particular in artificial intelligence and concurrency. The
   mu-calculus and its relatives are among the most expressive logics of
   this type. However, popular fixpoint logics tend to trade expressivity
   for simplicity and readability and in fact often live within the single
   variable fragment of the mu-calculus. The family of such flat fixpoint
   logics includes, e.g., Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), Computation Tree
   Logic (CTL), and the logic of common knowledge. Extending this notion to
   the generic semantic framework of coalgebraic logic enables covering a
   wide range of logics beyond the standard mu-calculus including, e.g.,
   flat fragments of the graded mu-calculus and the alternating-time
   mu-calculus (such as alternating-time temporal logic), as well as
   probabilistic and monotone fixpoint logics. We give a generic proof of
   completeness of the Kozen-Park axiomatization for such flat coalgebraic
   fixpoint logics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose and fabricate Integrate \& Fire neuron circuit
   for implementing neuromorphic system. Overall operation of the circuit
   is verified by measuring discrete devices and the output characteristics
   of the circuit. Since the neuron circuit shows asymmetric output
   characteristic that can drive synaptic device with
   Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) characteristic, the autonomous
   weight update process is also verified by connecting the synaptic device
   and the neuron circuit. The timing difference of the pre-neuron and the
   postneuron induce autonomous weight change of the synaptic device.
   Unlike 2-terminal devices, which is frequently used to implement
   neuromorphic system, proposed scheme of the system enables autonomous
   weight update and simple configuration by using 4-terminal synapse
   device and appropriate neuron circuit. Weight update process in the
   multi-layer neuron-synapse connection ensures implementation of the
   hardware-based artificial intelligence, based on Spiking-Neural-Network

Abstract = {{This study highlights the application of radial basis function (RBF)
   neural networks, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), and

   in aqueous solutions of tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB). The
   experimental data were gathered from a published work in literature. The
   proposed RBF network was coupled with genetic algorithm (GA) to access a
   better prediction performance of model. The structure of ANFIS model was
   trained by using hybrid method. The input parameters of the model were
   temperature, pressure, mass fraction of TBAB in feed aqueous solution
   (w(TBAB)), and mole fraction of TBAB in aqueous phase (x(TBAB)). The
   solubility of CO2 (x(CO2)) was the output parameter. Statistical and
   graphical analyses of the results showed that the proposed GA-RBF,
   Hybrid-ANFIS, and GEP models are robust and precise in the estimation of

Abstract = {{The bio-organisms are resilient in nature, where resilience is viewed as
   a sign of intelligence for understanding and reacting to the unforeseen
   changes in order to retain their normal functionalities. The resilient
   behavior within the livings is developed through an evolutionary cycle.
   Here, we want to provide an enterprise network (EN) with a resilient
   behavior by embedding intelligent formulations to guide EN through
   uncertain workload, which is not considered during early design stage.
   We formulated the resilient management problem within EN as an
   optimization problem, with an objective function is to maximize the
   resilience. We developed a bio-inspired tool comprising of Genetic
   Algorithm (GA), Molecular Assembly (MA) and Ant Colony Optimization
   (ACO). Our experimental results on an EN of 100 nodes, with a heavy
   backbone traffic of 7.6 TB demonstrated that GA gains the maximum
   resilience of 50\%, whereas MA gains 46\%, ACO gains 31.54\%, and the
   original EN had 20\% resilience. However, with light workload, MA and GA
   performed closely with a maximum resilience of 64\% and 62\%,
   respectively, and ACO showed a moderate resilience with a maximum of
   32\%.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, scholars used various computer vision and artificial

   imaging (MRI). In this paper, we proposed a novel system to detect
   sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). First, we used three-level bior4.4
   wavelet to decompose original brain image. Second, principal component
   analysis (PCA) was utilized for dimensionality reduction. Third, the
   generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine (GEPSVM) with
   Tikhonov regularization was employed as the classifier. The 10
   repetitions of five-fold cross validation showed our method achieved an
   overall accuracy of 95.71 \%. Our sensitivities over healthy control,
   left-sided SNHL, and right-sided SNHL are 96.00 \%, 95.33 \%, and 95.71
   \%, respectively. The proposed system is promising and effective in SNHL
   detection. It gives better performance than four state-of-the-art

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We present a new type of artificial neural network that generalizes on
   anatomical and dynamical aspects of the mammal brain. Its main novelty
   lies in its topological structure which is built as an array of
   interacting elementary motifs shaped like loops. These loops come in
   various types and can implement functions such as gating, inhibitory or
   executive control, or encoding of task elements to name a few. Each loop
   features two sets of neurons and a control region, linked together by
   non-recurrent projections. The two neural sets do the bulk of the loop's
   computations while the control unit specifies the timing and the
   conditions under which the computations implemented by the loop are to
   be performed. By functionally linking many such loops together, a neural
   network is obtained that may perform complex cognitive computations. To
   demonstrate the potential offered by such a system, we present two
   neural network simulations. The first illustrates the structure and
   dynamics of a single loop implementing a simple gating mechanism. The
   second simulation shows how connecting four loops in series can produce
   neural activity patterns that are sufficient to pass a simplified
   delayed-response task. We also show that this network reproduces
   electrophysiological measurements gathered in various regions of the
   brain of monkeys performing similar tasks. We also demonstrate
   connections between this type of neural network and recurrent or long
   short-term memory network models, and suggest ways to generalize them
   for future artificial intelligence research. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A memristive device is a novel passive device, which is essentially a
   resistor with memory. This device can be used for novel technical
   applications like neuromorphic computation. In this paper, we focus on
   anticipationa capability of a system to decide how to react in an
   environment by predicting future states. Especially, we have designed an
   elementary memristive circuit for the anticipation of digital patterns,
   where this circuit is based on the capability of an amoeba to anticipate
   periodically occurring unipolar pulses. The resulting circuit has been
   verified by digital simulations and has been realized in hardware as
   well. For the practical realization, we have used an Ag-doped
   TiO2-x-based memristive device, which has been fabricated in planar
   capacitor structures on a silicon wafer. The functionality of the
   circuit is shown by simulations and measurements. Finally, the
   anticipation of information is demonstrated by using images, where the
   robustness of this anticipatory circuit against noise and faulty
   intermediate information is visualized.}},

Abstract = {{A greenhouse system (GHS) is a closed structure that facilitates
   modified growth conditions to crops and provides protection from pests,
   diseases and adverse weather. However, a GHS exhibits non-linearity due
   to the interaction between the biological subsystem and the physical
   subsystem. Non-linear systems are difficult to control, particularly
   when their characteristics change with time. These systems are best
   handled with methods of computation intelligence, such as artificial
   neural networks (ANNs) and fuzzy systems. In the present work, the
   approximation capability of a neural network is used to model and
   control sufficient growth conditions of a GHS. An optimal neural
   network-based non-linear auto regressive with exogenous input (NARX)
   time series model is developed for a GHS. Based on the NARX model, two
   intelligent control schemes, namely a neural predictive controller (NPC)
   and non-linear auto regressive moving average (NARMA-L2) controller are
   proposed to achieve the desired growth conditions such as humidity and
   temperature for a better yield. Finally, closed-loop performances of the
   above two control schemes for servo and regulatory operations are
   analysed for various operating conditions using performance indices.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous mobile robots are receiving a lot of attention for many
   applications, such as package delivery and smart surveillance, however,
   the battery capacity is limited to implement intelligent decision making
   in robots because of the heavy computational costs. In this paper, an
   ultra-low-power artificial intelligence processor (AIP) is proposed for
   real-time decision making of autonomous mobile robots. To achieve low
   power consumption while maintaining high performance, it adopts four key
   features: 1) an 8-thread tree search processor for real-time path
   planning; 2) a reinforcement learning accelerator for the avoidance of
   unexpected obstacles; 3) a 3-level transposition table cache for the
   reduction of duplicated computations; and 4) a PVT compensation circuit
   for the stable operation at near-threshold voltage. The proposed 16
   mm(2) AIP is fabricated using 65-nm triple-well CMOS technology. It
   consumes only 1.1 mW at 0.55 V supply voltage and 7 MHz operating
   frequency, and 151 mW at 1.2 V supply voltage and 245 MHz operating
   frequency. The AIP achieves fast search speed (470 000 search/s) and low
   energy consumption (79 nJ/search), and it is successfully applied to a
   battery-powered robot system for autonomous navigation without any
   collision in dynamic indoor environments.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing traffic congestion poses significant challenges for urban
   planning and management in metropolitan areas around the world. One way
   to tackle the problem is to resort to the emerging technologies in
   artificial intelligence. Traffic light control is one of the most
   traditional and important instruments for urban traffic management. The
   present study proposes a traffic light control system enabled by a
   hierarchical multi-agent modeling framework in a decentralized manner.
   in the framework, a traffic network is decomposed into regions
   represented by region agents. Each region consists of intersections,
   modeled by intersection agents who coordinate with neighboring
   intersection agents through communication. For each intersection, a
   collection of turning movement agents operate individually and implement
   optimal actions according to local control policies. By employing a
   reinforcement learning algorithm for each turning movement agent, the
   intersection controllers are enabled with the capability to make their
   timing decisions in a complex and dynamic environment. In addition, the
   traffic light control operates with an advanced phase composition
   process dynamically combining compatible turning movements. Moreover,
   the collective operations performed by the agents in a road network are
   further coordinated by varying priority settings for relevant turning
   movements. A case study was carried out by simulations to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed control system while comparing it with an
   optimized vehicle-actuated control system. The results show that the
   proposed traffic light system, after a collective machine learning
   process, not only improves the local signal operations at individual
   intersections but also enhances the traffic performance at the regional
   level through coordination of specific turning movements. (C) 2017

   A large experimental test database that consists of 377 axial

Abstract = {{Welding processes are considered as an essential component in most of
   industrial manufacturing and for structural applications. Among the most
   widely used welding processes is the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW)
   due to its versatility and simplicity. In fact, the welding process is
   predominant procedure in the maintenance and repair industry,
   construction of steel structures and also industrial fabrication. The
   most important physical characteristics of the weldment are the bead
   geometry which includes bead height and width and the penetration.
   Different methods and approaches have been developed to achieve the
   acceptable values of bead geometry parameters. This study presents
   artificial intelligence techniques (AIT): For example, radial basis
   function neural network (RBF-NN) and multilayer perceptron neural
   network (MLP-NN) models were developed to predict the weld bead
   geometry. A number of 33 plates of mild steel specimens that have
   undergone SMAW process are analyzed for their weld bead geometry. The
   input parameters of the SMAW consist of welding current (A), arc length
   (mm), welding speed (mm/min), diameter of electrode (mm) and welding gap
   (mm). The outputs of the AIT models include property parameters, namely
   penetration, bead width and reinforcement. The results showed
   outstanding level of accuracy utilizing RBF-NN in simulating the weld
   geometry and very satisfactorily to predict all parameters in comparison
   with the MLP-NN model.}},

Abstract = {{If a solvable problem is currently unsolved, then something important to
   a solution is most likely being overlooked. From this simple observation
   we derive the obscure features hypothesis: every innovative solution is
   built upon at least one commonly overlooked or new (i.e., obscure)
   feature of the problem. By using a new definition of a feature as an
   effect of an interaction, we are able to accomplish five things. First,
   we are able to determine where features come from and how to search for
   new ones. Second, we are able to construct mathematical arguments that
   the set of features of an object is not computably enumerable. Third, we
   are able to characterize innovative problem solving as looking for a
   series of interactions that produce the desired effects (i.e., the
   goal). Fourth, we are able to construct a precise problem-solving
   grammar that is both human and machine friendly. Fifth, we are able to
   devise a visual and verbal problem-solving representation that both
   humans and computers can contribute to as they help counteract each
   other's problem-solving weaknesses. We show how computers can counter
   some of the known cognitive obstacles to innovation that humans have. We
   also briefly discuss ways in which humans can return the favor. We
   conclude that a promising process for innovative problem solving is a
   human-computer collaboration in which each partner assists the other in
   unearthing the obscure features of a problem.}},

Title = {{Lip segmentation using automatic selected initial contours based on
   localized active contour model}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and the increasing
   popularity of smart devices, human-computer interaction technology has
   become a multimedia and multimode technology from being computer-focused
   to people-centered. Among all ways of human-computer interactions, using
   language to interact with machines is the most convenient and efficient
   one. However, the performance of audio speech recognition systems is not
   satisfied in a noisy environment. Thus, more and more researchers focus
   their works on visual lip reading technology. By extracting lip movement
   features of speakers rather than audio features, visual lip reading
   systems can get superior results when noises and interferences exist.
   Lip segmentation plays an important role in a visual lip reading system,
   since the segmentation result is crucial to the final recognition
   accuracy. In this paper, we propose a localized active contour
   model-based method using two initial contours in a combined color space.
   We apply illumination equalization to original RGB images to decrease
   the interference of uneven illumination. A combined color space consists
   of the U component in CIE-LUV color space and the sum of C2 and C3
   components of the image after discrete Hartley transform. We select a
   rhombus as the initial contour of a closed mouth, because it has a
   similar shape to a closed lip. For an open mouth, we utilize a combined
   semi-ellipse as the initial contours of both outer and inner lip
   boundaries. After attaining the results of each color component
   separately, we merge them together to obtain the final segmentation
   result. From the experiment, we can conclude that this method can get
   better segmentation results compared with the method using a circle as
   the initial contour to segment gray images and images in combined color
   space, especially for open mouth. An extremely obvious advantage of this
   method is the results of open mouth excluding internal information of
   mouth such as teeth, black holes, and tongue, because of the
   introduction of the inner initial contour.}},

Abstract = {{Robot Motion Planning (RMP) has been a thrust area of research in
   computing due to its complexity, since RMP in dynamic environments for a
   point robot with bounded velocity is an NP-hard problem. This paper is a
   critical review of the major contributions to RMP in dynamic
   environments. Between 1985 and 2015 the focus has changed from the
   classical approach to a heuristic approach. For velocity based motion
   planning in dynamic environments, ICS AVOID (Fraichard and Asama, 2004,
   also see Section 2.4.4) is the safest approach which means that this
   method have the capability of for an autonomous robotic system to avoid
   collision with the obstacles in the environment. Other important
   approaches include artificial potential field based, artificial
   intelligence based, probabilistic based RMP and applications in areas of
   Agent systems and computer geometry. Classification of the RMP
   literature on the basis of the techniques and their performance has been
   attempted. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Adaptive artificial immune networks for mitigating DoS flooding attacks}},
Journal = {{SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{94-108}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Denial of service attacks pose a threat in constant growth. This is
   mainly due to their tendency to gain in sophistication, ease of
   implementation, obfuscation and the recent improvements in occultation
   of fingerprints. On the other hand, progress towards self-organizing
   networks, and the different techniques involved in their development,
   such as software-defined networking, network-function virtualization,
   artificial intelligence or cloud computing, facilitates the design of
   new defensive strategies, more complete, consistent and able to adapt
   the defensive deployment to the current status of the network. In order
   to contribute to their development, in this paper, the use of artificial
   immune systems to mitigate denial of service attacks is proposed. The
   approach is based on building networks of distributed sensors suited to
   the requirements of the monitored environment. These components are
   capable of identifying threats and reacting according to the behavior of
   the biological defense mechanisms in human beings. It is accomplished by
   emulating the different immune reactions, the establishment of
   quarantine areas and the construction of immune memory. For their
   assessment, experiments with public domain datasets (KDD'99, CAIDA'07
   and CAIDA'08) and simulations on various network configurations based on
   traffic samples gathered by the University Complutense of Madrid and
   flooding attacks generated by the tool DDoSIM were performed.}},

Pages = {{110-117}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been renewed interest in developing methods
   for skeleton-based human action recognition. In this study, the
   challenging problem of the similarity degree of skeleton-based human
   postures is addressed. Human posture is described by screw motions
   between 3D rigid bodies, which can be seen as a relation matrix of 3D
   rigid bodies (RMRB3D). A linear subspace, a point of a Grassmannian
   manifold, is spanned by the orthonormal basis of matrix RMRB3D. A
   powerful way to compute the similarity degree between postures is
   researched to solve the geodesic distance between points on the
   Grassmannian manifold. Then representative postures are extracted
   through spectral clustering over representative postures. An action will
   be represented by a symbol sequence generated with a global linear
   eigenfunction constructed by spectral embedding. Finally, dynamic time
   warping and hidden Markov model (HMM) are used to classify these action
   sequences. The experimental evaluations of the proposed method on
   several challenging 3D action datasets show that the proposed approaches
   achieve promising results compared with other skeleton-based human
   action recognition algorithms.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{A community structure is an integral part of a social network. Detecting
   such communities plays an important role in a wide range of
   applications, including but not limited to cluster analysis,
   recommendation systems and understanding the behaviour of complex
   systems. Researchers have derived many algorithms to discover the
   community structures of networks. Discovering communities is a
   challenging task, and there is no single algorithm that produces the
   best results for all networks. Therefore, despite many elegant
   solutions, discovering communities remains an active area of research.
   In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, the Clustering
   Coefficient-based Genetic Algorithm (CC-GA), for detecting them in
   social and complex networks. Researchers have used several genetic
   algorithms to detect communities, but the proposed algorithm is novel in
   terms of both the generation of the initial population and the mutation
   method, and these improve its efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on a
   variety of real-world datasets and a comparison to state-of-the-art
   genetic and non-genetic-based algorithms show improved results. (C) 2017

Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{183-190}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background and objective: This paper builds different neural network
   models with simple topologies, having one or two hidden layers which
   were subsequently employed in the prediction of ocular changes
   progression in patients with diabetes associated with primer open-angle
   glaucoma.
   Material and Methods: For attempting to indicate whether there is a
   relationship between glaucoma and diabetes, a simulation method, based
   on artificial neural networks (ANN), Jordan Elman networks(JEN) type, in
   particular, was applied in conjunction with clinical observation. The
   study was conducted on a sample of 101 eyes with open angle glaucoma
   included and, in each case, the patients had associated diabetes
   mellitus. A high degree of accuracy was exhibited by the models,
   demonstrating the potential effectiveness of this artificial
   intelligence technique for predicting ocular changes associated with
   diabetes. The parameters considered in this study for modelling purpose
   were: glaucoma age, diabetes age, C/D ratio (cup/disk size), glycated
   haemoglobin level (HbA1c), intraocular pressure (IOP), patient age, mean
   deviation (MD) and LENS appearance.
   Results: Relatively simple models, feed-forward neural networks with one
   or two intermediate layers, provided clinically meaningful data in
   direct modelling, the probability of correct answers being of 95\%.
   Inverse modelling was also performed, in which MD depreciation was the
   output parameter. High accuracy was exhibited, in this case, with Jordan
   Elman networks, with the confidence interval of +/- 15\%.
   Conclusions: The neural models have demonstrated the possibility of
   their use in successfully predicting the relationship between glaucoma
   and diabetes in a real clinical environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This work aims to develop a methodology to perform the active demand
   side management for households in smart grids, which contain distributed
   solar photovoltaic generation and energy storage. Such methodology
   outcomes a decision-making system that manages the battery aiming to
   reduce the consumer electricity cost. It also contributes to postpone
   the investments in expansion of the electricity grid if the higher
   loading period coincides with the higher electricity tariff of the day.
   The decision-making system is a validated neural network, trained with
   optimized data, which can be used in any household meeting certain
   conditions - specific location and electricity tariff, and consumption
   profile like to the standard verified by the local electricity utility.
   To validate this methodology, it was created three consumption and three
   solar generation profiles, which were combined to each other. The
   results show that the ANN-based decision-making system operates the
   battery efficiently to achieve the minimum electricity bill.}},

Abstract = {{Of late, neural networks and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) are both
   attractive topics in the research areas related to Artificial
   Intelligence. Deep neural networks have achieved great successes in
   supervised learning problems, and MIL as a typical weakly-supervised
   learning method is effective for many applications in computer vision,
   biometrics, natural language processing, and so on. In this article, we
   revisit Multiple Instance Neural Networks (MINNs) that the neural
   networks aim at solving the MIL problems. The MINNs perform MIL in an
   end-to-end manner, which take bags with a various number of instances as
   input and directly output the labels of bags. All of the parameters in a
   MINN can be optimized via back-propagation. Besides revisiting the old
   MINNs, we propose a new type of MINN to learn bag representations, which
   is different from the existing MINNs that focus on estimating instance
   label. In addition, recent tricks developed in deep learning have been
   studied in MINNs; we find deep supervision is effective for learning
   better bag representations. In the experiments, the proposed MINNs
   achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on several MIL
   benchmarks. Moreover, it is extremely fast for both testing and
   training, for example, it takes only 0.0003 s to predict a bag and a few
   seconds to train on MIL datasets on a moderate CPU. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {{Optimal operation of interconnected energy hubs by using decomposed
   hybrid particle swarm and interior-point approach}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{36-46}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The Energy Hub has become an important concept for formally optimizing
   multi-carrier energy infrastructure to increase system flexibility and
   efficiency. The existence of energy storage within energy hubs enables
   the dynamic coordination of energy supply and demand against varying
   energy tariffs and local renewable generation to save energy cost. The
   battery lifetime cost may be included in the optimization objective
   function to better utilize battery for long term use. However, the
   operational optimization of an interconnected energy hub system with
   battery lifetime considered presents a highly constrained, multi period,
   non-convex problem. This paper proposes Particle Swarm Optimization
   (PSO) hybridised with a numerical method, referred to collectively as
   the decomposition technique. It decouples the complicated optimization
   problem into sub-problems, namely the scheduling of storage and other
   elements in the energy hub system, and separately solves these by PSO
   and the numerical method `interior-point'. This approach thus overcomes
   the disadvantages of numerical methods and artificial intelligence
   algorithms that suffer from convergence only to a local minimum or
   prohibitive computation times, respectively. The new approach is applied
   to an example two-hub system and a three-hub system over a time horizon
   of 24 h. It is also applied to a large eleven-hub system to test the
   performance of the approach and discuss the potential applications. The
   results demonstrate that the method is capable of achieving very near
   the global minimum, verified by an analytical approach, and is fast
   enough to allow an online, receding time horizon implementation. (C)

Title = {{Some metaheuristics should be simplified}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{427}},
Pages = {{32-62}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Users have a large and constantly increasing number of optimization
   metaheuristics at their disposal. In pursuit of ever better approaches,
   popular and successful methods are often improved a number of times in a
   row, or various methods are hybridized. One should, however, pay
   attention to whether such deliberately improved or hybridized methods do
   not become unnecessarily complicated, or if some of their elements do
   not introduce a structural bias. In the first case the algorithm should
   be simplified by eliminating the unneeded elements. This will make it
   more clear to the users, and, as shown in this study, may even improve
   the results. In the second case, operators that are responsible for over
   frequent sampling of some part of the search space have to be removed.
   In this study we address the problem of over-complexity of
   metaheuristics, focusing on two joint winners of the CEC2016 competition
   on single-objective numerical optimization, L-SHADE-EpSin and UMOEA-II
   algorithms. It is shown that each of them includes a procedure which
   introduces a structural bias by attracting population towards the origin
   0. As discussed in the text, in the case of seven out of 30 benchmark
   problems considered in the CEC2016 competition the objective function
   values in the origin 0 are better than those found by the vast majority
   of algorithms, hence structural bias affects the results obtained by
   L-SHADE-EpSin and UMOEA-II. In this work we simplify both algorithms by
   removing operators that are the main cause of structural bias. Further,
   we show that in the L-SHADE-EpSin algorithm the Ensemble Sinusoidal
   adaptation mechanism of control parameter F, that is used during the
   first half of the search, is not needed. Slightly better results on both
   artificial benchmarks used in the CEC2016 competition and on a wide set
   of real-world problems may be obtained if, during that period of the
   sewn, the value of F is simply set to 0.5. Such a simplified algorithm
   is competitive against a large number of metaheuristics and may be much
   easier for the users to understand. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A truly autonomous artificial intelligence agent should be able to drive
   its own learning process. That is, decide what to explore and what to
   learn, identifying what constitutes potential useful data as examples of
   concepts or what strategy to follow to solve a new task. Different
   efforts have been developed in machine learning towards this aim.
   Approaches that introduce new concepts, like predicate invention in
   Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) techniques, normally require the
   selection of examples by the user. Techniques that learn behavior
   policies through exploration like Reinforcement Learning (RL) with
   intrinsic motivation, to guide the agent into interesting areas to
   discover new goals, assume that all the states and actions are
   predefined in advance. In this paper, we describe a system, called ADC,
   that combines techniques from ILP with predicate invention and RL with
   intrinsic motivation to discover new concepts, states and actions to
   learn behavior policies. ADC drives its own learning process, collecting
   its own examples for autonomously learning concepts. These new concepts
   can be used to describe its environment and define new states and
   actions used to learn behaviors to solve tasks. We show the
   effectiveness of our approach in simulated robotics environments. (C)

Abstract = {{Deep neural networks (DNNs) have attracted significant attention for
   their excellent accuracy especially in areas such as computer vision and
   artificial intelligence. To enhance their performance, technologies for
   their hardware acceleration are being studied. FPGA technology is a
   promising choice for hardware acceleration, given its low power
   consumption and high flexibility which makes it suitable particularly
   for embedded systems. However, complex DNN models may need more
   computing and memory resources than those available in many current
   FPGAs. This paper presents FP-BNN, a binarized neural network (BNN) for
   FPGAs, which drastically cuts down the hardware consumption while
   maintaining acceptable accuracy. We introduce a Resource-Aware Model
   Analysis (RAMA) method, and remove the bottleneck involving multipliers
   by bit-level XNOR and shifting operations, and the bottleneck of
   parameter access by data quantization and optimized on-chip storage. We
   evaluate the FP-BNN accelerator designs for MNIST multi-layer
   perceptrons (MLP), Cifar-10 ConvNet, and AlexNet on a Stratix-V FPGA
   system. An inference performance of Tera opartions per second with
   acceptable accuracy loss is obtained, which shows improvement in speed

Abstract = {{This study presents a novel micro-grid protection scheme based on
   Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and machine learning techniques.
   Initialisation of the proposed approach is done by extracting the
   three-phase current signals at the targeted buses of different feeders.
   The obtained non-stationary signals are passed through the empirical
   mode decomposition method to extract different intrinsic mode functions
   (IMFs). In the next step using HHT to the selected IMFs component,
   different needful differential features are computed. The extracted
   features are further used as an input vector to the machine learning
   models to classify the fault events. The proposed micro-grid protection
   scheme is tested for different protection scenarios, such as the type of
   fault (symmetrical, asymmetrical and high impedance fault), micro-grid
   structure (radial and mesh) and mode of operation (islanded and grid
   connected) and so on. Three different machine learning models are tested
   and compared in this framework: Naive Bayes classifier, support vector
   machine and extreme learning machine. The extensive simulated results
   from a standard IEC micro-grid model prove the effectiveness and
   reliability of the proposed micro-grid protection scheme.}},

Title = {{Stochastic Primal-Dual Proximal ExtraGradient descent for compositely
   regularized optimization}},

Abstract = {{We consider a wide range of regularized stochastic minimization problems
   with two regularization terms, one of which is composed with a linear
   function. This optimization model abstracts a number of important
   applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning, such as
   fused Lasso, fused logistic regression, and a class of graph-guided
   regularized minimization. The computational challenges of this model are
   in two folds. On one hand, the closed-form solution of the proximal
   mapping associated with the composed regularization term or the expected
   objective function is not available. On the other hand, the calculation
   of the full gradient of the expectation in the objective is very
   expensive when the number of input data samples is considerably large.
   To address these issues, we propose a stochastic variant of
   extra-gradient type methods, namely Stochastic Primal-Dual Proximal
   ExtraGradient descent (SPDPEG), and analyze its convergence property for
   both convex and strongly convex objectives. For general convex
   objectives, the uniformly average iterates generated by SPDPEG converge
   in expectation with O (1/root t) rate. While for strongly convex
   objectives, the uniformly and non-uniformly average iterates generated
   by SPDPEG converge with O (log (t)/t) and O (1/t) rates, respectively.
   The order of the rate of the proposed algorithm is known to match the
   best convergence rate for first-order stochastic algorithms. Experiments
   on fused logistic regression and graph-guided regularized logistic
   regression problems show that the proposed algorithm performs very
   efficiently and consistently outperforms other competing algorithms. (C)

Abstract = {{Addressing deleterious effects of noncoding mutations is an essential
   step towards the identification of disease-causal mutations of gene
   regulatory elements. Several methods for quantifying the deleteriousness
   of noncoding mutations using artificial intelligence, deep learning and
   other approaches have been recently proposed. Although the majority of
   the proposed methods have demonstrated excellent accuracy on different
   test sets, there is rarely a consensus. In addition, advanced
   statistical and artificial learning approaches used by these methods
   make it difficult porting these methods outside of the labs that have
   developed them. To address these challenges and to transform the
   methodological advances in predicting deleterious noncoding mutations
   into a practical resource available for the broader functional genomics
   and population genetics communities, we developed SNPDelScore, which
   uses a panel of proposed methods for quantifying deleterious effects of
   noncoding mutations to precompute and compare the deleteriousness scores
   of all common SNPs in the human genome in 44 cell lines. The panel of
   deleteriousness scores of a SNP computed using different methods is
   supplemented by functional information from the GWAS Catalog, libraries
   of transcription factor-binding sites, and genic characteristics of
   mutations. SNPDelScore comes with a genome browser capable of displaying
   and comparing large sets of SNPs in a genomic locus and rapidly
   identifying consensus SNPs with the highest deleteriousness scores
   making those prime candidates for phenotype-causal polymorphisms.}},

Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Deep neural networks have been achieving booming breakthroughs in
   various artificial intelligence tasks, however they are notorious for
   consuming unbearable hardware resources, training time and power. The
   emerging pruning/binarization methods, which aim at both decreasing
   overheads and retaining high performance, seem to promise applications
   on portable devices. However, even with these most advanced algorithms,
   we have to save the full-precision weights during the gradient descent
   process which remains size and power bottlenecks of memory access and
   the resulting computation. To address this challenge, we propose a
   unified discrete state transition (DST) framework by introducing a
   probabilistic projection operator that constrains the weight matrices in
   a discrete weight space (DWS) with configurable number of states,
   throughout the whole training process. The experimental results over
   various data sets including MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN show the
   effectiveness of this framework. The direct transition between discrete
   states significantly saves memory for storing weights in full precision,
   as well as simplifies the computation of weight updating. The proposed
   DST framework is hardware friendly as it can be easily implemented by a
   wide range of emerging portable devices, including binary, ternary and
   multiple-level memory devices. This work paves the way for on-chip
   learning on various portable devices in the near future. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Bone injures (BI) represents one of the major health problems, together
   with cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Assessment of the risks
   associated with BI is nontrivial since fragility of human cortical bone
   is varying with age. Due to restrictions for performing experiments on
   humans, only a limited number of fracture resistance curves (R-curves)
   for particular ages have been reported in the literature. This study
   proposes a novel decision support system for the assessment of bone
   fracture resistance by fusing various artificial intelligence
   algorithms. The aim was to estimate the R-curve slope, toughness
   threshold and stress intensity factor using the two input parameters
   commonly available during a routine clinical examination: patients age
   and crack length. Using the data from the literature, the evolutionary
   assembled Artificial Neural Network was developed and used for the
   derivation of Linear regression (LR) models of R-curves for arbitrary
   age. Finally, by using the patient (age)-specific LR models and
   diagnosed crack size one could estimate the risk of bone fracture under
   given physiological conditions. Compared to the literature, we
   demonstrated improved performances for estimating nonlinear changes of
   R-curve slope (R-2 = 0.82 vs. R-2 = 0.76) and Toughness threshold with
   ageing (R-2 = 0.73 vs. R-2 = 0.66).}},

   Radio Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{1055-1072}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) enables unlicensed users to sense for and access
   underutilized licensed channels (or white spaces) owned by the licensed
   users in an opportunistic manner. Clustering segregates nodes in a
   network into logical groups called clusters. In CR networks (CRNs),
   larger cluster size improves network scalability thereby contributing to
   reduced routing overhead; however, it reduces cluster stability as the
   number of available common channels in a cluster reduces resulting in
   increased number of re-clusterings and clustering overhead. This paper
   presents our proposed first-of-its-kind cluster size adjustment scheme
   based on an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement
   learning. The proposed scheme adapts the cluster size with the amount of
   white spaces as time goes by in order to improve network scalability and
   cluster stability in CRNs. Due to the lack of progress in the
   investigation of cluster size adjustment schemes in the literature, this
   paper also analyzes their attributes, and then presents such schemes
   investigated in various kinds of distributed wireless networks.
   Simulation results show that our proposed scheme improves network
   scalability by creating larger clusters, and improves cluster stability
   by reducing the number of re-clusterings (i.e., the number of cluster
   splits) and clustering overhead, while reducing interference between
   licensed and unlicensed users in CRNs.}},

Title = {{Dual Learning-Based Safe Se-Supervised Learning}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{2615-2621}},
Abstract = {{In many real-world applications, labeled instances are generally limited
   and expensively collected, while the most instances are unlabeled and
   the amount is often sufficient. Therefore, semi supervised learning
   (SSL) has attracted much attention, since it is an effective tool to
   discover the unlabeled instances. However, how to safely make use of the
   unlabeled instances is an emerging and interesting problem in SSL.
   Hence, we propose DuAL Learning-based sAfe Semi-supervised learning
   (DALLAS), which employs dual learning to estimate the safety or risk of
   the unlabeled instances. To realize the safe exploitation of the
   unlabeled instances, our basic idea is to use supervised learning (SL)
   to analyze the risk of the unlabeled instances. First, DALLAS utilizes a
   primal model obtained by dual learning to classify each unlabeled
   instance and then uses a dual model to reconstruct the unlabeled
   instances according to the obtained classification results. The risk can
   be measured by analyzing the reconstruction error and predictions of the
   original and reconstructed unlabeled instances. If the error is small
   and the predictions are equal, the unlabeled instance may be safe.
   Otherwise, the instance may be risky and its output should be approach
   to be that obtained by SL. Finally, we embed a risk-based regularization
   term into SSL. Hence, the outputs of our algorithm are a tradeoff
   between those of SL and SSL. In particular, we utilize respectively
   regularized least squares (RLS) and Laplacian RLS for SL and SSL. To
   verify the effectiveness of the proposed safe mechanism in DALLAS, we
   carry out a series of experiments on several data sets by the comparison
   with the state-of-the-art supervised, semi-supervised, and safe
   semi-supervised learning methods and the results demonstrate that DALLAS
   can effectively reduce the risk of the unlabeled instances.}},

Abstract = {{This paper surveys the current state of the art in Natural Language
   Generation (NLG), defined as the task of generating text or speech from
   non-linguistic input. A survey of NLG is timely in view of the changes
   that the field has undergone over the past two decades, especially in
   relation to new (usually data-driven) methods, as well as new
   applications of NLG technology. This survey therefore aims to (a) give
   an up-to-date synthesis of research on the core tasks in NLG and the
   architectures adopted in which such tasks are organised; (b) highlight a
   number of recent. research topics that have arisen partly as a result of
   growing synergies between NW and other areas of artificial intelligence;
   (c) draw attention to the challenges in NLG evaluation, relating them to
   similar challenges faced in other areas of NLP, with an emphasis on
   different evaluation methods and the relationships between them.}},

Title = {{Automatic Generation of News Comments Based on Gated Attention Neural
   Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Abstract = {{With the development of recurrent neural networks (RNN), various natural
   language generation (NLG) tasks have boomed in the past few years, such
   as response generation in conversation and poetry generation. However,
   automatic generation of news comments is a new, challenging and not
   well-studied task in NLG. Different from other NLG tasks, this task
   requires the contextual relevance between comments and news. In
   addition, we need to generate diversified comments, because different
   people usually have different opinions on the same news in the real
   world. In this paper, we propose a gated attention neural network model
   (GANN) to generate news comments. To address the problem of contextual
   relevance, we introduce the gated attention mechanism to use news
   context self-adaptively and selectively. To ensure the diversity of
   comments, we use random sample and relevance control to generate
   comments with different topics and degrees of relevance. Moreover, we
   apply generative adversarial nets to improve GANN. Automatic evaluation
   with perplexity score reveals that GANN outperforms the existing comment
   generation methods. Human evaluation proves that the generated news
   comments are close to human comments.}},

Abstract = {{The technological world has witnessed many revolutions since the
   beginning of the 21st century, such as mobile development, cloud
   computing, big data, artificial intelligence and also the Internet of
   Things. The internet of things revolution is driven by a broader access
   to internet and versatility of programmable hardware devices that can
   communicate between each other. In order to make internet of things
   devices, a technical background is required in many fields, especially
   electronics and Computer Science. Therefore, many efforts are put in
   place to develop educational kits that simplify the basics of these two
   fields so that everyone can make his internet of things prototype
   without technical knowledge. The authors present their own initiative:
   IOIOAI that simplifies the programming process for the input output
   input output electrical board. The service has been tested successfully
   on children and young students. In this paper, the authors present a
   wider adoption for their initiative. The IOIOAI service is implemented
   in introductory course to embedded systems for electrical and computer
   science students during the 2016-2017 academic year in the National
   Engineering School of Sfax, Tunisia. The efficiency of the solution is

Abstract = {{In polyethylene terephthalate's (PET)'s recycling processes, separation
   from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is of prior relevance due to its toxicity,
   which degrades the final quality of recycled PET. Moreover, the
   potential presence of some polymers in mixed plastics (such as PVC in
   PET) is a key aspect for the use of recycled plastic in products such as
   medical equipment, toys, or food packaging. Many works have dealt with
   plastic classification by hyperspectral imaging, although only some of
   them have been directly focused on PET sorting and very few on its
   separation from PVC. These works use different classification models and
   preprocessing techniques and show their performance for the problem at
   hand. However, still, there is a lack of methodology to address the goal
   of comparing and finding the best model and preprocessing technique.
   Thus, this paper presents a design of experiments-based methodology for
   comparing and selecting, for the problem at hand, the best preprocessing
   technique, and the best latent variable-based and/or artificial
   intelligence classification method, when using NIR hyperspectral images.

Abstract = {{Cyber Physical Processes (CPPs) refer to a new generation of business
   processes enacted in many application environments (e.g., emergency
   management, smart manufacturing, etc.), in which the presence of
   Internet-of-Things devices and embedded ICT systems (e.g., smartphones,
   sensors, actuators) strongly influences the coordination of the
   real-world entities (e.g., humans, robots, etc.) inhabitating such
   environments. A Process Management System (PMS) employed for executing
   CPPs is required to automatically adapt its running processes to
   anomalous situations and exogenous events by minimising any human
   intervention. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing an
   approach and an adaptive Cognitive PMS, called SmartPM, which combines
   process execution monitoring, unanticipated exception detection and
   automated resolution strategies leveraging on three well-established
   action-based formalisms developed for reasoning about actions in
   Artificial Intelligence (AI), including the situation calculus,
   IndiGolog and automated planning. Interestingly, the use of SmartPM does
   not require any expertise of the internal working of the AI tools

Abstract = {{Drought forecasting is a vital for mitigating the impact of drought
   events on the economy, tourism, agriculture and water resource systems.
   This paper adopts the proposed Wavelet-ARIMA-ANN (WAANN) model and the
   latest Wavelet-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (WANFIS) model to
   predict the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)
   at the Langat River Basin for different time scales (1-month, 3-months
   and 6-months). Model input data pre-processing with wavelet
   decomposition for improving the performance of the models was carried
   out apriori. The historical SPEI from 1976 to 2007 were used in the
   WAANN and WANFIS models for predicting the SPEI for the test period from
   2008 to 2015. The Adjusted Coefficient of Determination (R-adj(2)),
   Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Willmott's
   Index of Agreement (d) and the Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient of Efficiency
   (E) were used to assess the models. It was found that the prediction
   accuracy of the two models improved with time scale length. For the
   prediction of SPEI-1 (1-month), the errors associated with both models
   were considered relatively high. Based on the performance measures and
   graphical plots, the WAANN model is better for the prediction of SPEI-3
   and SPEI-6. The WANFIS model had satisfactory prediction of the mid-term
   drought forecasting for all stations. The WAANN model developed in this
   study however, gives better accuracy for both, the short-term and
   mid-term drought forecasting.}},

   to perfect accuracy. The learned pattern probabilities can be used for
   de novo SMILES generation. This molecular design concept eliminates the
   need for virtual compound library enumeration. By employing transfer
   learning, we fine-tuned the RNNs predictions for specific molecular
   targets. This approach enables virtual compound design without requiring
   secondary or external activity prediction, which could introduce error
   or unwanted bias. The results obtained advocate this generative RNN-LSTM
   system for high-impact use cases, such as low-data drug discovery,
   fragment based molecular design, and hit-to-lead optimization for
   diverse drug targets.}},

Abstract = {{Generative artificial intelligence offers a fresh view on molecular
   design. We present the first-time prospective application of a deep
   learning model for designing new druglike compounds with desired
   activities. For this purpose, we trained a recurrent neural network to
   capture the constitution of a large set of known bioactive compounds
   represented as SMILES strings. By transfer learning, this general model
   was fine-tuned on recognizing retinoid X and peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor agonists. We synthesized five
   top-ranking compounds designed by the generative model. Four of the
   compounds revealed nanomolar to low-micromolar receptor modulatory
   activity in cell-based assays. Apparently, the computational model
   intrinsically captured relevant chemical and biological knowledge
   without the need for explicit rules. The results of this study advocate
   generative artificial intelligence for prospective de novo molecular
   design, and demonstrate the potential of these methods for future
   medicinal chemistry.}},

   Applications}},
Journal = {{IEEE CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS MAGAZINE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{29-44}},
Abstract = {{Memristors have recently received significant attention as device-level
   components for building a novel generation of computing systems. These
   devices have many promising features, such as non-volatility, low power
   consumption, high density, and excellent scalability. The ability to
   control and modify biasing voltages at memristor terminals make them
   promising candidates to efficiently perform matrix-vector
   multiplications and solve systems of linear equations. In this article,
   we discuss how networks of memristors arranged in crossbar arrays can be
   used for efficiently solving optimization and machine learning problems.
   We introduce a new memristor-based optimization framework that combines
   the computational merits of memristor crossbars with the advantages of
   an operator splitting method, the alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM). Here, ADMM helps in splitting a complex optimization
   problem into subproblems that involve the solution of systems of linear
   equations. The strength of this framework is shown by applying it to
   linear programming, quadratic programming, and sparse optimization. In
   addition to ADMM, implementation of a customized power iteration method
   for eigenvalue/eigenvector computation using memristor crossbars is
   discussed. The memristor-based power iteration method can further be
   applied to principal component analysis. The use of memristor crossbars
   yields a significant speed-up in computation, and thus, we believe, has
   the potential to advance optimization and machine learning research in
   artificial intelligence.}},

Abstract = {{Extracting and recognizing complex human movements from unconstrained

   This paper proposes the classification of Indian classical dance actions
   using a powerful artificial intelligence tool: convolutional neural
   networks (CNN). In this work, human action recognition on Indian
   classical dance videos is performed on recordings from both offline
   (controlled recording) and online (live performances, YouTube) data. The
   offline data is created with ten different subjects performing 200
   familiar dance mudras/poses from different Indian classical dance forms
   under various background environments. The online dance data is
   collected from YouTube for ten different subjects. Each dance pose is
   occupied for 60 frames or images in a video in both the cases. CNN
   training is performed with 8 different sample sizes, each consisting of
   multiple sets of subjects. The remaining 2 samples are used for testing
   the trained CNN. Different CNN architectures were designed and tested
   with our data to obtain a better accuracy in recognition. We achieved a

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) is a recent swarm intelligence algorithm.
   There have been some greedy ABC variants developed to enhance the
   exploitation capability, but greedy variants are usually less reliable
   and may cause premature convergence, especially without proper control
   on the greediness degree. In this paper, we propose an adaptive ABC
   algorithm (AABC), which is characterized by a novel greedy position
   update strategy and an adaptive control scheme for adjusting the
   greediness degree. The greedy position update strategy incorporates the
   information of top t solutions into the search process of the onlooker
   bees. Such a greedy strategy is beneficial to fast convergence
   performance. In order to adapt the greediness degree to fit for
   different optimization scenarios, the proposed adaptive control scheme
   further adjusts the size of top solutions for selection in each
   iteration of the algorithm. The adjustment is based on considering the
   current search tendency of the bees. This way, by combining the greedy
   position update process and the adaptive control scheme, the convergence
   performance and the robustness of the algorithm can be improved at the
   same time. A set of benchmark functions is used to test the proposed
   AABC algorithm. Experimental results show that the components of AABC
   can significantly improve the performance of the classic ABC algorithm.
   Moreover, the AABC performs better than, or at least comparably to, some
   existing ABC variants as well as other state-of-the-art evolutionary
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The field of human-robot interaction (HRI) is a broad community
   encompassing robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), human-computer
   interaction (HCI), psychology and social science. HRI in social robotics
   explores important issues in designing a robot system that works with
   people in daily life environments, capable of interacting with,
   modeling, and learning from humans. Robotic systems should improve their
   capabilities to not only understand humans but also to convey their
   intention within their actions. The present work demonstrates this
   behaviour is achievable through a field study conducted at a science
   museum. This article introduces a computer vision algorithm which is
   able to detect and track a leader within a group of people the science
   communicator, for this particular case -and distinguish between group
   members and non-group members as well, all by means of a cognitive and
   logical behaviour analysis of their interactions on scene. The leader's
   direction is also computed as an attention reference for this approach.
   The computer vision system is supervising people within a group
   following a guide to prevent accidents and missing persons. This work
   represents one of a wide range of possible applications and future

Abstract = {{Energy is vital for the sustainable development of China. Accurate
   forecasts of annual energy demand are essential to schedule energy
   supply and provide valuable suggestions for developing related

   artificial intelligence-based (AI-based) model has received considerable

   still needs to be addressed. In this study, a new energy demand
   forecasting framework is presented at first. On the basis of historical
   annual data of electricity usage over the period of 1985-2015, the
   coefficients of linear and quadratic forms of the AI-based model are
   optimized by combining an adaptive genetic algorithm and a cointegration
   analysis shown as an example. Prediction results of the proposed model
   indicate that the annual growth rate of electricity demand in China will
   slow down. However, China will continue to demand about 13 trillion
   kilowatt hours in 2030 because of population growth, economic growth,
   and urbanization. In addition, the model has greater accuracy and
   reliability compared with other single optimization methods.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative multi-agent planning (MAP) is a relatively recent research
   field that combines technologies, algorithms, and techniques developed
   by the Artificial Intelligence Planning and Multi-Agent Systems
   communities. While planning has been generally treated as a single-agent
   task, MAP generalizes this concept by considering multiple intelligent
   agents that work cooperatively to develop a course of action that
   satisfies the goals of the group.
   This article reviews the most relevant approaches to MAP, putting the
   focus on the solvers that took part in the 2015 Competition of

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new method for combining an ensemble of classifiers,
   called Consensus-based Combining Method (CCM) is proposed and evaluated.
   As in most other combination methods, the outputs of multiple
   classifiers are weighted and summed together into a single final
   classification decision. However, unlike the other methods, CCM adjusts
   the weights iteratively after comparing all of the classifiers' outputs.
   Ultimately, all the weights converge to a final set of weights, and the
   combined output reaches a consensus. The effectiveness of CCM is
   evaluated by comparing it with popular linear combination methods
   (majority voting, product, and average method). Experiments are
   conducted on 14 public data sets, and on a blog spam data set created by
   the authors. Experimental results show that CCM provides a significant
   improvement in classification accuracy over the product and average
   methods. Moreover, results show that the CCM's classification accuracy
   is better than or comparable to that of majority voting.}},

Pages = {{151-170}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new nonparametric calibration method called
   ensemble of near-isotonic regression (ENIR). The method can be
   considered as an extension of BBQ (Naeini et al., in: Proceedings of
   twenty-ninth AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, 2015b), a
   recently proposed calibration method, as well as the commonly used
   calibration method based on isotonic regression (IsoRegC) (Zadrozny and
   Elkan, in: Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD international conference on
   knowledge discovery and data mining 2002). ENIR is designed to address
   the key limitation of IsoRegC which is the monotonicity assumption of
   the predictions. Similar to BBQ, the method post-processes the output of
   a binary classifier to obtain calibrated probabilities. Thus, it can be
   used with many existing classification models to generate accurate
   probabilistic predictions. We demonstrate the performance of ENIR on
   synthetic and real datasets for commonly applied binary classification
   models. Experimental results show that the method outperforms several
   common binary classifier calibration methods. In particular, on the real
   data, we evaluated ENIR commonly performs statistically significantly
   better than the other methods, and never worse. It is able to improve
   the calibration power of classifiers, while retaining their
   discrimination power. The method is also computationally tractable for
   large-scale datasets, as it is time, where N is the number of samples.}},

Abstract = {{Human gait provides a way of locomotion by combined efforts of the
   brain, nerves, and muscles. Conventionally, the human gait has been
   considered subjectively through visual observations but now with
   advanced technology, human gait analysis can be done objectively and
   empirically for the better quality of life. In this paper, the
   literature of the past survey on gait analysis has been discussed. This
   is followed by discussion on gait analysis methods. Vision-based human
   motion analysis has the potential to provide an inexpensive,
   non-obtrusive solution for the estimation of body poses. Data parameters
   for gait analysis have been discussed followed by preprocessing steps.
   Then the implemented machine learning techniques have been discussed in
   detail. The objective of this survey paper is to present a comprehensive
   analysis of contemporary gait analysis. This paper presents a framework
   (parameters, techniques, available database, machine learning
   techniques, etc.) for researchers in identifying the infertile areas of
   gait analysis. The authors expect that the overview presented in this
   paper will help advance the research in the field of gait analysis.
   Introduction to basic taxonomies of human gait is presented.
   Applications in clinical diagnosis, geriatric care, sports, biometrics,
   rehabilitation, and industrial area are summarized separately. Available
   machine learning techniques are also presented with available datasets
   for gait analysis. Future prospective in gait analysis are discussed in
   the end.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{381-392}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An autonomous framework to evaluate layout of a piping design in the
   form of piping and instrumentation diagram (P\&ID) according to a set of
   standards of marine and offshore industry is proposed. The method starts
   with transforming a P\&ID into a vector x in R-d. Transformation is done
   based on a concept introduced for piping known as Histogram of
   Connectivity. The proposed descriptor captures two essential properties
   of P\&ID: attributes of each component and connectivity among the
   components. Next, linear support vector machine (SVM) is used to learn a
   classifier from existing compliant and noncompliant designs.
   Subsequently, the linear classifier can be used to check if an unseen
   design complies with the standards. In addition, to enable follow up on
   noncompliant design including correction or modification, a method to
   analyze the reason of noncompliance prediction by the learned SVM model
   is introduced. The method has demonstrated encouraging performance in
   two challenging data sets of designs created with advice from
   experienced engineers in the industry, based on International Convention
   for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) and Rules for
   Classification of Ships of Lloyd's Register.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper is motivated by need of marine and
   offshore industry for automated solution for design appraisal. This
   paper aims to address this issue by using a machine learning-based
   approach. Some compliant and noncompliant designs are provided to a
   developed algorithm for a machine (or computer) to learn. After learning
   is completed, the machine is able to classify unseen designs as
   compliant or noncompliant. As highlighted in this paper, the developed
   method has demonstrated encouraging performance in two case studies,
   including specific parts in MARPOL and Rules of Lloyd's Register. For
   adoption by industry, necessary steps include collecting some designs
   (compliant and noncompliant) available in an organization and feeding
   these into the developed method for learning by machine before it can
   predict. With ability of highlighting possible connections that cause
   noncompliance, follow up and correction on a noncompliant design is made
   possible.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for automatically calibrating and assessing
   the calibration quality of an externally tracked 2-D ultrasound (US)
   probe by scanning arbitrary, natural tissues, as opposed a specialized
   calibration phantom as is the typical practice. A generativetopic model
   quantifies the posterior probability of calibration parameters
   conditioned on local 2-D image features arising from a generic
   underlying substrate. Auto-calibration is achieved by identifying the
   maximum a-posteriori image-to-probe transform, and calibration quality
   is assessed online in terms of the posterior probability of the current
   image-to-probe transform. Both are closely linked to the 3-D point
   reconstruction error (PRE) in aligning feature observations arising from
   the same underlying physical structure in different US images. The
   method is of practical importance in that it operates simply by scanning
   arbitrary textured echogenic structures, e.g., in-vivo tissues in the
   context of the US-guided procedures, without requiring specialized
   calibration procedures or equipment. Observed data take the form of
   local scale-invariant features that can be extracted and fit to the
   model in near real-time. Experiments demonstrate the method on a public
   data set of in vivo human brain scans of 14 unique subjects acquired in
   the context of neurosurgery. Online calibration assessment can be
   performed at approximately 3 Hz for the US images of 640 x 480 pixels.
   Auto-calibration achieves an internal mean PRE of 1.2 mm and a
   discrepancy of {[}2 mm, 6 mm] in comparison to the calibration via a
   standard phantom-based method.}},

   methods were tested and evaluated using seventy-two MSG images taken at
   different times and dates. The fuzzy logic method leads to cloud
   detection accuracy of 84.41\%, and the neural network achieved an
   average accuracy of 99.69\%. Our proposed methods detected not only
   thick clouds but also thin and the less bright clouds. To give more
   support to our results, we made a comparison between the proposed
   approaches and the cloud mask product which is one of the applications
   integrate into software package Satellite Application Facility to
   NoWCasting and Very Short Range Forecasting (SAFNWC/MSG) by the European
   Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites EUMETSAT
   applied on the same MSG data. The high average accuracy achieved by our
   neural network proposed method (and more less for fuzzy logic)
   demonstrates its effectiveness and robustness and also the utility to
   benefit of using the artificial intelligent techniques in remote sensing
   imagery applications.}},

Title = {{Accelerating exact and approximate inference for (distributed) discrete
   optimization with GPUs}},

Abstract = {{Discrete optimization is a central problem in artificial intelligence.
   The optimization of the aggregated cost of a network of cost functions
   arises in a variety of problems including Weighted Constraint Programs
   (WCSPs), Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP), as well as
   optimization in stochastic variants such as the tasks of finding the
   most probable explanation (MPE) in belief networks. Inference-based
   algorithms are powerful techniques for solving discrete optimization
   problems, which can be used independently or in combination with other
   techniques. However, their applicability is often limited by their
   compute intensive nature and their space requirements. This paper
   proposes the design and implementation of a novel inference-based
   technique, which exploits modern massively parallel architectures, such
   as those found in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), to speed up the
   resolution of exact and approximated inference-based algorithms for
   discrete optimization. The paper studies the proposed algorithm in both
   centralized and distributed optimization contexts. The paper
   demonstrates that the use of GPUs provides significant advantages in
   terms of runtime and scalability, achieving up to two orders of
   magnitude in speedups and showing a considerable reduction in execution
   time (up to 345 times faster) with respect to a sequential version.}},

Abstract = {{The recent development of advanced television systems has demonstrated a
   need for an efficient video conversion technique. In this scenario,
   frame rate up conversion (FRUC) solutions play an important role due to
   their benefits in both increasing the viewing quality experience and
   reducing the cost of video transmission. However, with the recent
   increase in video resolution, notably from standard definition to high
   definition (HD) and ultra HD, FRUC now requires not only better
   interpolated frame quality but also lower FRUC time processing.
   Considering this problem, this study proposes a novel statistical
   learning based adaptive search range (SR) solution to enable an
   effective FRUC mechanism. In the proposed adaptive SR solution, a set of
   spatial-temporal features are carefully defined and exploited to
   adaptively assign an appropriate SR value to each considered block,
   notably by formulating the SR adaptation as a classification problem and
   using the well-known support vector machine framework for the
   classification task. Experimental results conducted on a rich set of
   common video test sequences show the advantages of the proposed adaptive
   SR solution, notably in both interpolated frame quality improvement and
   time processing reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Two artificial agents (a humanoid robot and a virtual human) are
   enriched with various similar intelligence, autonomy, functionalities
   and interaction modalities. The agents are integrated in the form of a
   cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) through a shared communication
   platform to create a social ecology. In the ecology, the agents
   collaborate (assist each other) to perform a real-world task (search for
   a hidden object) for the benefits of humans. A robot-virtual human
   bilateral trust model is derived and a real-time trust measurement
   method is developed. The role of taking initiative in the collaboration
   is switched between the agents following a finite state machine model
   triggered by bilateral trust, which results in a mixed-initiative
   collaboration. A scheme is developed to evaluate the performance of the
   agents in the ecology through the CPSS. The results show that the robot
   and the virtual human perform satisfactorily in the collaboration
   through the CPSS. The results thus prove the effectiveness of the
   real-world ecology between artificial agents of heterogeneous realities
   through a shared platform based on trust-triggered mixed-initiatives.
   The results can help develop adaptive social ecology comprising
   intelligent agents of heterogeneous realities to assist humans in
   various tasks through collaboration between the agents in the form of a

Abstract = {{Convolutional neural network (CNN) has become a successful algorithm in
   the region of artificial intelligence and a strong candidate for many
   computer vision algorithms. But the computation complexity of CNN is
   much higher than traditional algorithms. With the help of GPU
   acceleration, CNN-based applications are widely deployed in servers.
   However, for embedded platforms, CNN-based solutions are still too
   complex to be applied. Various dedicated hardware designs on
   field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been carried out to
   accelerate CNNs, while few of them explore the whole design flow for
   both fast deployment and high power efficiency. In this paper, we
   investigate state-of-the-art CNN models and CNN-based applications.
   Requirements on memory, computation and the flexibility of the system
   are summarized for mapping CNN on embedded FPGAs. Based on these
   requirements, we propose Angel-Eye, a programmable and flexible CNN
   accelerator architecture, together with data quantization strategy and
   compilation tool. Data quantization strategy helps reduce the bit-width
   down to 8-bit with negligible accuracy loss. The compilation tool maps a
   certain CNN model efficiently onto hardware. Evaluated on Zynq XC7Z045
   platform, Angel-Eye is 6x faster and 5x better in power efficiency than
   peer FPGA implementation on the same platform. Applications of VGG
   network, pedestrian detection and face alignment are used to evaluate
   our design on Zynq XC7Z020. NIVIDA TK1 and TX1 platforms are used for
   comparison. Angel-Eye achieves similar performance and delivers up to
   16x better energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims at evaluating the capabilities to detect road
   traversability in urban and extra-urban scenarios of support vector
   machine-based classifiers that use local descriptors extracted from

   obtained from geometric and appearance-based features. A comparison
   among the performance of descriptors individually has demonstrated that
   the normal vector-based descriptor achieves an accuracy of 88\%,
   outperforming by about 6\%-15\% all the other considered ones. To
   further improve the interpretation capabilities, the space of features
   is augmented by merging the components of each point descriptor,
   reaching 92\% classification accuracy. A set of test scenarios have been
   acquired during an extensive experimental campaign using an all-terrain
   vehicle. Tests on real data show high classification performance for
   road scenarios and rural environments; the generality of the method
   makes it applicable for different types of mobile robots including, but

Abstract = {{A tree t-spanner is a spanning tree T in which the ratio of distance
   between every pair of vertices is at most t times their shortest
   distance in a connected graph, where t is a value called stretch factor
   of T. On a given connected, undirected, and weighted graph, this paper
   studies the tree t-spanner problem( Tree t-SP) that aims to find a
   spanning tree whose stretch factor is minimum amongst all spanning trees
   of the graph. Being a NP-Hard for any fixed t > 1, this problem is
   under-studied in the domain of metaheuristic techniques. In literature,
   only genetic algorithm has been proposed for this problem. This paper
   presents an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm for this problem,
   where ABC algorithm is a swarm intelligence technique inspired by
   intelligent foraging behavior of honey bees. Neighborhood strategies of
   ABC algorithm particularly employ problem-specific knowledge that makes
   ABC algorithm highly effective in searching high quality solutions in
   less computational time. Computational experiments on a large set of
   randomly generated graph instances exhibit superior performance of ABC
   algorithm over the existing genetic algorithm for the Tree t-SP. (C)

Abstract = {{In this study, a neuro-evolutionary technique is developed for solving
   singularly perturbed boundary value problems (SP-BVPs) of linear and
   nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by exploiting the
   strength of feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic
   algorithms (GAs) and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) technique.
   Mathematical modeling of SP-BVPs is constructed by using a universal
   function approximation capability of ANNs in mean square sense. Training
   of design parameter of ANNs is carried out by GAs, which is used as a
   tool for effective global search method integrated with SQP algorithm
   for rapid local convergence. The performance of the proposed design
   scheme is tested for six linear and nonlinear BVPs of singularly
   perturbed systems. Comprehensive numerical simulation studies are
   conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms
   of accuracy, robustness and convergence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The integration between connectionist learning and logic-based reasoning
   is a longstanding foundational question in artificial intelligence,
   cognitive systems, and computer science in general. Research into
   neural-symbolic integration aims to tackle this challenge, developing
   approaches bridging the gap between sub-symbolic and symbolic
   representation and computation. In this line of work the core method has
   been suggested as a way of translating logic programs into a multilayer
   perceptron computing least models of the programs. In particular, a
   variant of the core method for three valued Lukasiewicz logic has proven
   to be applicable to cognitive modelling among others in the context of
   Byrne's suppression task. Building on the underlying formal results and
   the corresponding computational framework, the present article provides
   a modified core method suitable for the supervised learning of
   Lukasiewicz logic (and of a closely-related variant thereof), implements
   and executes the corresponding supervised learning with the
   backpropagation algorithm and, finally, constructs a rule extraction
   method in order to close the neural-symbolic cycle. The resulting system
   is then evaluated in several empirical test cases, and recommendations
   for future developments are derived. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Artificial intelligence techniques were applied for detecting small
   moving targets in maritime clutter environments. Neural detectors are
   considered to approximate the Neyman-Pearson (NP) in composite
   hypothesis testing problems. Sub-optimum approaches based on the
   Constrained Generalized Likelihood Ratio (CGLR) were analysed, and
   compared to conventional implementations based on Doppler filtering that
   are designed to filter clutter and improve the Signal-to-Interference
   Ratio, and Constant False Alarm Rate techniques. The CGLR performance
   was significantly better at the expense of a high computational cost. As
   a solution, neural network training sets were designed for approximating
   the NP detector. The detection of small boats in Gaussian clutter was
   the defined case study in order to assume the design hypothesis of the
   conventional solutions and to study their performance under their most
   favourable conditions. Detection schemes were evaluated using real radar
   data. Neural solutions based on Second Order Neural Networks provide the
   best results, being able to approximate the CGLR with a significantly
   low computational cost compatible with real-time operations. (C) 2017

Title = {{Optimistic planning with an adaptive number of action switches for
   near-optimal nonlinear control}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{355-367}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We consider infinite-horizon optimal control of nonlinear systems where
   the control actions are discrete, and focus on optimistic planning
   algorithms from artificial intelligence, which can handle general
   nonlinear systems with nonquadratic costs. With the main goal of
   reducing computations, we introduce two such algorithms that only search
   for constrained action sequences. The constraint prevents the sequences
   from switching between different actions more than a limited number of
   times. We call the first method optimistic switch-limited planning
   (OSP), and develop analysis showing that its fixed number of switches S
   leads to polynomial complexity in the search horizon, in contrast to the
   exponential complexity of the existing OP algorithm for deterministic
   systems; and to a correspondingly faster convergence towards optimality.
   Since tuning S is difficult, we introduce an adaptive variant called
   OASP that automatically adjusts S so as to limit computations while
   ensuring that near-optimal solutions keep being explored. OSP and OASP
   are analytically evaluated in representative special cases, and
   numerically illustrated in simulations of a rotational pendulum. To show
   that the algorithms also work in challenging applications, OSP is used
   to control the pendulum in real time, while OASP is applied for
   trajectory control of a simulated quadrotor. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Developing a new intelligent system for the diagnosis of tuberculous

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{153}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objective: In countries with high prevalence of
   tuberculosis (TB), clinicians often diagnose tuberculous pleural
   effusion (TPE) by using diagnostic tests, which have not only poor
   sensitivity, but poor availability as well. The aim of our study is to
   develop a new artificial intelligence based diagnostic model that is
   accurate, fast, non-invasive and cost effective to diagnose TPE. It is
   expected that a tool derived based on the model be installed on simple
   computer devices (such as smart phones and tablets) and be used by
   clinicians widely.
   Methods: For this study, data of 140 patients whose clinical signs,
   routine blood test results, blood biochemistry markers, pleural fluid
   cell type and count, and pleural fluid biochemical tests' results were
   prospectively collected into a database. An Artificial intelligence
   based diagnostic model, which employs moth flame optimization based
   support vector machine with feature selection (FS-MFO-SVM), is
   constructed to predict the diagnosis of TPE.
   Results: The optimal model results in an average of 95\% accuracy (ACC),
   0.9564 the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC),
   93.35\% sensitivity, and 97.57\% specificity for FS-MFO-SVM.
   Conclusions: The proposed artificial intelligence based diagnostic model
   is found to be highly reliable for diagnosing TPE based on simple
   clinical signs, blood samples and pleural effusion samples. Therefore,
   the proposed model can be widely used in clinical practice and further
   evaluated for use as a substitute of invasive pleural biopsies. (C) 2017

Title = {{Optimization of fed-batch fermentation processes using the Backtracking
   Search Algorithm}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{286-297}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Fed-batch fermentation has gained attention in recent years due to its
   beneficial impact in the economy and productivity of bioprocesses.
   However, the complexity of these processes requires an expert system
   that involves swarm intelligence-based metaheuristics such as Artificial
   Algae Algorithm (AAA), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Covariance Matrix
   Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES) and Differential Evolution (DE)
   for simulation and optimization of the feeding trajectories. DE
   traditionally performs better than other evolutionary algorithms and
   swarm intelligence techniques in optimization of fed-batch fermentation.
   In this work, an improved version of DE namely Backtracking Search
   Algorithm (BSA) has edged DE and other recent metaheuristics to emerge
   as superior optimization method. This is shown by the results obtained
   by comparing the performance of BSA, DE, CMAES, MA and ABC in solving
   six fed batch fermentation case studies. BSA gave the best overall
   performance by showing improved solutions and more robust convergence in
   comparison with various metaheuristics used in this work. Also, there is
   a gap in the study of fed-batch application of wastewater and sewage
   sludge treatment. Thus, the fed batch fermentation problems in winery
   wastewater treatment and biogas generation from sewage sludge are
   investigated and reformulated for optimization. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{424}},
Pages = {{273-286}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The deterioration in a corporation's profitability not only threatens
   its interests and sustainable development but also causes tremendous
   losses to other investors. Hence, constructing an effective pre-warning
   model for performance forecasting is an urgent requirement. Most
   previous studies only analyzed monetary-based ratios, but merely
   considering such ratios does not depict the full perspective of a
   corporation's business conditions. This study thus extends
   monetary-based ratios to non-monetary-based ratios and aggregates them
   through the analytic network process (ANP) with a risk-adjusted strategy
   to establish performance ranks of corporations. Analyzing a
   corporation's business relationships can help it to react to changes in
   the market and improve profit margins, as it draws upon such
   relationship networks for the transfer of scarce resources and
   knowledge. We believe that no current study adopts such a method to
   construct a forecasting model. To fill this gap in the literature, this
   study implements the social network (SN) technique to examine a
   corporation's competitive edge from seemingly noisy big media data,
   which are subsequently fed into an artificial intelligence (AI)-based
   technique to construct the model. The introduced model, examined through
   real-life cases under numerous conditions, offers a promising
   alternative for performance forecasting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are well known for their credible
   ability to capture non-linear trends in scientific data. However, the
   heuristic nature of estimation of parameters associated with ANNs has
   prevented their evolution into efficient surrogate models. Further, the
   dearth of optimal training size estimation algorithms for the data
   greedy ANNs resulted in their overfitting. Therefore, through this work,
   we aim to contribute a novel ANN building algorithm called TRANSFORM
   aimed at simultaneous and optimal estimation of ANN architecture,
   training size and transfer function. TRANSFORM is integrated with three
   standalone Sobol sampling based training size determination algorithms
   which incorporate the concepts of hypercube sampling and optimal space
   filling. TRANSFORM was used to construct ANN surrogates for a highly
   non-linear industrially validated continuous casting model from steel
   plant. Multiobjective optimization of casting model to ensure maximum
   productivity, maximum energy saving and minimum operational cost was
   performed by ANN assisted Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms
   (NSGA-II). The surrogate assisted optimization was found to be 13 times
   faster than conventional optimization, leading to its online
   implementation. Simple operator's rules were deciphered from the optimal
   solutions using Pareto front characterization and K-means clustering for
   optimal functioning of casting plant. Comprehensive studies on (a)
   computational time comparisons between proposed training size estimation
   algorithms and (b) predictability comparisons between constructed ANNs
   and state of art statistical models, Kriging Interpolators adds to the
   other highlights of this work. TRANSFORM takes physics based model as
   the only input and provides parsimonious ANNs as outputs, making it
   generic across all scientific domains. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Graph matching is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and
   structural data processing. Hypergraph matching has recently become
   popular in the graph matching community. Existing hypergraph matching
   algorithms usually resort to the continuous methods, while the
   combinatorial nature of hypergraph matching is not well considered.
   Therefore in this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph matching
   algorithm by introducing the affinity tensor updating based graduated
   projection. Specifically, the hypergraph matching problem is first
   formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem in a high order
   polynomial form. Then this NP-hard problem is relaxed and interpreted in
   a probabilistic manner, which is approximately solved by iterative
   techniques. The updating of the affinity tensor is performed in each
   iteration, besides the updating of probabilistic assignment vector.
   Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets witness
   the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This study proposes efficient methods for sequential power flow (SPF)
   analysis of distribution systems with intermittent photovoltaic (PV)
   units and fluctuated loads. The proposed methods are based on machine
   learning techniques; more specifically, they use a regression trees
   (RTs) algorithm to construct a model for voltage estimation. This model
   is trained using synthetic data generated by a number of PV generation
   and load demand scenarios. The SPF methods that utilise iterative
   techniques have a high computational burden. In turn, the proposed
   method, which is called SPF-RT, is fast and accurate. Furthermore, the
   authors combine SPF-RT with a correction method to develop a new method,
   called SPF-RTC, which significantly reduces the estimation error of the
   RT model. The proposed methods are tested using a 33-bus distribution
   test system interconnected with two PV units. To assess the performance
   of the proposed methods, they conducted several experiments at different
   resolutions of day/year data. The proposed methods are compared with the
   iterative SPF methods and validated using the OpenDSS software. The
   simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the
   other methods in terms of the computational speed. The SPF-RT and
   SPF-RTC methods are useful for real-time assessment of distribution
   systems with PV units.}},

   notion. The notion of intelligence that advocates of the technological
   singularity promote does not take into account the full dimension of
   human intelligence. They treat artificial intelligence as a figure
   without a ground. Human intelligence as we will show is not based solely
   on logical operations and computation, but also includes a long list of
   other characteristics that are unique to humans, which is the ground
   that supporters of the Singularity ignore. The list includes curiosity,

Title = {{Can Computers Become Conscious, an Essential Condition for the
   Singularity?}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Given that consciousness is an essential ingredient for achieving
   Singularity, the notion that an Artificial General Intelligence device
   can exceed the intelligence of a human, namely, the question of whether
   a computer can achieve consciousness, is explored. Given that
   consciousness is being aware of one's perceptions and/or of one's
   thoughts, it is claimed that computers cannot experience consciousness.
   Given that it has no sensorium, it cannot have perceptions. In terms of
   being aware of its thoughts it is argued that being aware of one's
   thoughts is basically listening to one's own internal speech. A computer
   has no emotions, and hence, no desire to communicate, and without the
   ability, and/or desire to communicate, it has no internal voice to
   listen to and hence cannot be aware of its thoughts. In fact, it has no
   thoughts, because it has no sense of self and thinking is about
   preserving one's self. Emotions have a positive effect on the reasoning
   powers of humans, and therefore, the computer's lack of emotions is
   another reason for why computers could never achieve the level of
   intelligence that a human can, at least, at the current level of the
   development of computer technology.}},

Abstract = {{The Artificial Neural Networks Training (ANNT) process is an
   optimization problem of the weight set which has inspired researchers
   for a long time. By optimizing the training of the neural networks using
   optimal weight set, better results can be obtained by the neural
   networks. Traditional neural networks algorithms such as Back
   Propagation (BP) were used for ANNT, but they have some drawbacks such
   as computational complexity and getting trapped in the local minima.
   Therefore, evolutionary algorithms like the Swarm Intelligence (SI)
   algorithms have been employed in ANNT to overcome such issues.
   Artificial Bees Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm is one of the
   competitive algorithms in the SI algorithms group. However, hybrid
   algorithms are also a fundamental concern in the optimization field,
   which aim to cumulate the advantages of different algorithms into one
   algorithm. In this work, we aimed to highlight the performance of the
   Hybrid Particle-move Artificial Bee Colony (HPABC) algorithm by applying
   it on the ANNT application. The performance of the HPABC algorithm was
   investigated on four benchmark pattern-classification datasets and the
   results were compared with other algorithms. The results obtained
   illustrate that HPABC algorithm can efficiently be used for ANNT. HPABC
   outperformed the original ABC and PSO as well as other state-of-art and
   hybrid algorithms in terms of time, function evaluation number and
   recognition accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a review of artificial intelligence for different

   based games are quick combat games in which the objective is to dominate

   age of empires, and command \& conquer, etc. In such games, each player
   needs to utilize resources efficiently, which includes managing
   different types of soldiers, units, equipment's, economic status,
   positions and the uncertainty during the combat in real time. Now the
   best human players face difficulty in defeating the best RTS games due
   to the recent success and advancement of deep mind technologies. In this
   paper, we explain state-of-the-art and challenges in artificial
   intelligence (AI) for RTS games and Starcraft, describing problems and
   issues carried out by RTS based games with some solutions that are
   addressed to them. Finally, we conclude by emphasizing on game `CIG \&

   importance. A significant class of such risks is related to the
   engineering of requirements, commonly involving the presentation and
   analysis of risk management arguments from both software engineers and

   inspiration from argumentation theory in Artificial Intelligence, we
   introduce a number of ``argumentation schemes{''} and associated
   ``critical questions{''} to support such discussions. In doing so, we
   propose schemes related to risks due to excessive numbers of
   requirements; inadequate client representatives and poor understanding
   of client needs; incorrect, incomplete and conflicting requirements;
   complex and non-traceable requirements; non-stable requirements; and low
   quality requirements. We also discuss a case study and two experiments
   where the developed schemes supported the discussion of requirement
   risks in software projects. The overall results of these experiments
   indicate that our schemes are useful in the identification, proposition
   and analysis of requirement risks, adequately supporting debates on

Abstract = {{In this paper we focus on the most efficacious AI applications for life
   extension and anti-aging at three expected stages of AI development:
   narrow AI, AGI and superintelligence. First, we overview the existing
   research and commercial work performed by a select number of startups
   and academic projects. We find that at the current stage of ``narrow{''}
   AI, the most promising areas for life extension are
   geroprotector-combination discovery, detection of aging biomarkers, and
   personalized anti-aging therapy. These advances could help currently
   living people reach longevity escape velocity and survive until more
   advanced AI appears. When AI comes close to human level, the main
   contribution to life extension will come from AI integration with humans
   through brain-computer interfaces, integrated AI assistants capable of
   autonomously diagnosing and treating health issues, and cyber systems
   embedded into human bodies. Lastly, we speculate about the more remote
   future, when AI reaches the level of superintelligence and such
   life-extension methods as uploading human minds and creating
   nanotechnological bodies may become possible, thus lowering the
   probability of human death close to zero. We suggest that medical AI
   based superintelligence could be safer than, say, military AI, as it may
   help humans to evolve into part of the future superintelligence via
   brain augmentation, uploading, and a network of self-improving humans.
   Medical AI's value system is focused on human benefit.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial superintelligence (ASI) is artificial intelligence (AI) with
   capabilities that are significantly greater than human capabilities
   across a wide range of domains. A hallmark of the ASI issue is
   disagreement among experts. This paper demonstrates and discusses
   methodological options for modeling and interpreting expert disagreement
   about the risk of ASI catastrophe. Using a new model called ASI-PATH,
   the paper models a well-documented recent disagreement between Nick
   Bostrom and Ben Goertzel, two distinguished ASI experts. Three points of
   disagreement are considered: (1) the potential for humans to evaluate
   the values held by an AI, (2) the potential for humans to create an AI
   with values that humans would consider desirable, and (3) the potential
   for an AI to create for itself values that humans would consider
   desirable. An initial quantitative analysis shows that accounting for
   variation in expert judgment can have a large effect on estimates of the
   risk of ASI catastrophe. The risk estimates can in turn inform ASI risk
   management strategies, which the paper demonstrates via an analysis of
   the strategy of AI confinement. The paper find the optimal strength of
   AI confinement to depend on the balance of risk parameters (1) and (2).}},

Abstract = {{In the context of superintelligent AI systems, the term ``oracle{''} has
   two meanings. One refers to modular systems queried for domain-specific
   tasks. Another usage, referring to a class of systems which may be
   useful for addressing the value alignment and AI control problems, is a
   superintelligent AI system that only answers questions. The aim of this
   manuscript is to survey contemporary research problems related to
   oracles which align with long-term research goals of AI safety. We
   examine existing question answering systems and argue that their high
   degree of architectural heterogeneity makes them poor candidates for
   rigorous analysis as oracles. On the other hand, we identify computer
   algebra systems (CASs) as being primitive examples of domain-specific
   oracles for mathematics and argue that efforts to integrate computer
   algebra systems with theorem provers, systems which have largely been
   developed independent of one another, provide a concrete set of problems
   related to the notion of provable safety that has emerged in the AI
   safety community. We review approaches to interfacing CASs with theorem
   provers, describe well-defined architectural deficiencies that have been
   identified with CASs, and suggest possible lines of research and
   practical software projects for scientists interested in AI safety.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we contrast three major pathways to human level AI, also
   known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), and we investigate how
   safety considerations compare between the three. The first pathway is de
   novo AGI (dnAGI), AGI built from the ground up. The second is
   Neuromorphic AGI (NAGI), AGI based loosely on the principles of the
   human brain. And third is Whole Brain Emulation (WBE), AGI built by
   emulating a particular human brain, in silico. Bostrom has previously
   argued that NAGI is the least safe form of the three. NAGI would be
   messier than dnAGI and therefore harder to align to arbitrary values.
   Additionally, NAGI would not intrinsically possess safeguards found in
   the human brain - such as compassion - while WBE would. In this paper,
   we argue that getting WBE first would be preferable to getting dnAGI
   first. While the introduction of WBE would likely be followed by a later
   transition to the less-constrained and therefore more-powerful dnAGI,
   the creation of dnAGI would likely be less dangerous if accomplished by
   WBEs than if done simply by biological humans, for a variety of reasons.
   One major reason is that the higher intelligence and quicker speed of
   thinking in the WBEs compared to biological humans could increase the
   chances of traversing the path through dnAGI safely. We additionally
   investigate the major technological trends leading to these three types
   of AGI, and we find these trends to be: traditional AI research,
   computational hardware, nanotechnology research, nanoscale neural
   probes, and neuroscience. In particular, we find that WBE is unlikely to
   be achieved without nanoscale neural probes, since much of the
   information processing in the brain occurs on the subcellular level
   (i.e., the nanoscale). For this reason, we argue that nanoscale neural
   probes could improve safety by favoring WBE over NAGI.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound scans, Computed Axial Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   are only few examples of medical imaging tools boosting physicians in
   diagnosing a wide range of pathologies. Anyway, no standard methodology
   has been defined yet to extensively exploit them and current diagnoses
   procedures are still carried out mainly relying on physician's
   experience. Although the human contribution is always fundamental, it is
   self-evident that an automatic procedure for image analysis would allow
   a more rapid and effective identification of dysmorphisms. Moving toward
   this purpose, in this work we address the problem of feature extraction
   devoted to the detection of specific diseases involving facial
   dysmorphisms. In particular, a bounded Depth Minimum Steiner Trees
   (D-MST) clustering algorithm is presented for discriminating groups of
   individuals relying on the manifestation/absence of the labio-schisis
   pathology, commonly called cleft lip. The analysis of three-dimensional
   facial surfaces via Differential Geometry is adopted to extract
   landmarks. The extracted geometrical information is furthermore
   elaborated to feed the unsupervised clustering algorithm and produce the
   classification. The clustering returns the probability of being affected
   by the pathology, allowing physicians to focus their attention on risky
   individuals for further analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The need to have equitable access to quality healthcare is enshrined in
   the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which
   defines the developmental agenda of the UN for the next 15 years. In
   particular, the third SDG focuses on the need to ``ensure healthy lives
   and promote well-being for all at all ages{''}. In this paper, we build
   the case that 5G wireless technology, along with concomitant emerging
   technologies (such as IoT, big data, artificial intelligence and machine
   learning), will transform global healthcare systems in the near future.
   Our optimism around 5G-enabled healthcare stems from a confluence of
   significant technical pushes that are already at play: apart from the
   availability of high-throughput low-latency wireless connectivity, other
   significant factors include the democratization of computing through
   cloud computing; the democratization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
   cognitive computing (e.g., IBM Watson); and the commoditization of data
   through crowdsourcing and digital exhaust. These technologies together
   can finally crack a dysfunctional healthcare system that has largely
   been impervious to technological innovations. We highlight the
   persistent deficiencies of the current healthcare system and then
   demonstrate how the 5G-enabled healthcare revolution can fix these
   deficiencies. We also highlight open technical research challenges, and
   potential pitfalls, that may hinder the development of such a 5G-enabled
   health revolution.}},

Abstract = {{A standard model captures a community consensus over a coherent region
   of science, serving as a cumulative reference point for the field that
   can provide guidance for both research and applications, while also
   focusing efforts to extend or revise it. Here we propose developing such
   a model for humanlike minds, computational entities whose structures and
   processes are substantially similar to those found in human cognition.
   Our hypothesis is that cognitive architectures provide the appropriate
   computational abstraction for defining a standard model, although the
   standard model is not itself such an architecture. The proposed standard
   model began as an initial consensus at the 2013 AAAI Fall Symposium on
   Integrated Cognition, but is extended here through a synthesis across
   three existing cognitive architectures: ACT-R, Sigma, and Soar. The
   resulting standard model spans key aspects of structure and processing,
   memory and content, learning, and perception and motor, and highlights
   loci of architectural agreement as well as disagreement with the
   consensus while identifying potential areas of remaining incompleteness.
   The hope is that this work will provide an important step toward
   engaging the broader community in further development of the standard
   model of the mind.}},

Abstract = {{Over the decades, the view of agency in artificial intelligence (AI) has
   narrowed to one that emphasizes acting in a way that maximizes reward.
   This perspective fails to make contact with the broader academic and
   legal communities where agency is bound up with personal accountability.
   To explore this gap in meaning, we introduce a spectrum of control that
   characterizes standard approaches to constructing agents and points the
   way toward agents that can be held responsible. The linchpin that
   enables agents to control their actions in the ``right way{''} is
   attention. Broadly construed, attention lets an agent that is responsive
   to its environment consider the relationships among its actions, goals,
   and norms while also avoiding distraction. This ability enables
   strategic norm violations and opens the door to artificial, human-level
   agency.}},

Title = {{Artificial memory optimization}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{497-526}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To solve some complicated optimization problems, an artificial memory
   optimization (AMO) is constructed based on the human memory mechanism.
   In AMO, a memory cell is used to trace an alternative solution of a
   problem to be solved; memorizing and forgetting rules of the human
   memory mechanism are used to control state transition of each memory
   cell; the state of a memory cell consists of two components, one is the
   solution state which associates with an alternative solution being
   traced; another is the memory state which associates with the memory
   information resulting from tracing results, where the memory residual
   value (MRV) is stored; the states of memory cells are divided into three
   types: instantaneous, short- and long-term memory state, each of which
   can be strengthened or weakened by accepted stimulus strength. If the
   solution state of a memory cell has transferred to a good position, its
   MRV will increase, and then the memory cell is not easily to be
   forgotten; when the solution state of a memory cell is at sticky state,
   its MRV will decrease until the memory cell is forgotten; this will
   effectively prevent invalid iteration. In the course of evolution, a
   memory cell may strive to evolve from the instantaneous, short-term
   memory state to long-term memory state, it makes search to be various.
   Because AMO has 6 operators at the curent version, it has wider
   adaptability to solve different types of optimization problems. Besides,
   these operators are automatically dispatched according to their
   executing efficiency. Results show that AMO possesses of strong search
   capability and high convergence speed when solving some complicated
   function optimization problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GRAPHICS-UK}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{49-58}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Unbiased global illumination methods based on stochastical techniques
   provide photorealistic images. However, they are prone to noise that can
   only be reduced by increasing the number of processed samples. The
   problem of finding the number of samples that are required in order to
   ensure that most observers cannot perceive any noise is still an open
   issue. In this article, we address this problem focusing on visual
   perception of noise. However, rather than using known perceptual models,
   we investigate the use of learning approaches classically used in the
   field of Artificial Intelligence. Hence, we propose to use such
   approaches to create a model which is able to learn which image
   highlights perceptual noise. The learning is performed through the use
   of a database of examples based on experimentations of noise perception
   with human users. This model can then be used in any progressive
   stochastic global illumination method in order to find the visual
   convergence threshold of different parts of an input image. (C) 2017

Journal = {{IET SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1104-1113}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study concerns the issue of jointly enhancing noise robustness and
   promoting signal sparsity in Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL), which aims
   at addressing the performance deficiency of sparse signal recovery due
   to uninformative data with low signal-to-noise ratios. In particular,
   the authors propose a hierarchical prior noise model with a
   signal-dependent parametrisation and incorporate it into developing the
   robust SBL algorithms for sparse signal recovery. The main contribution
   of the proposed approach is twofold. The first is the new consideration
   of noise-robustness enhancement in building SBL algorithms, which
   devotes to noise awareness in counteracting outliers in measurements.
   Specifically, the idea of signal-sparsity enforcing is extended to build
   a Least Absolute Deviation like loss criterion with the proposed
   hierarchical prior model of measurement noise. The second is the novelty
   of using the signal-dependent parametrisation in the proposed noise
   model. Indeed, the signal-dependent mechanism plays an indispensable
   role in producing the reliable noise parameter estimation jointly with
   updating signal model parameters under the fast SBL framework. In
   addition to numerical simulation studies, the real-life application of
   radio tomographic imaging is presented to validate the proposed
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of the individual chemical constituents of a mixture,
   especially solutions extracted from medicinal plants, is a
   time-consuming task. The identification results are often limited by
   challenges such as the development of separation methods and the
   availability of known reference standards. A novel structure elucidation
   system, NP-StructurePredictor, is presented and used to accelerate the
   process of identifying chemical structures in a mixture based on a
   branch and bound algorithm combined with a large collection of natural
   product databases. NP-StracturePredictor requires only targeted
   molecular weights calculated from a list of m/z values from liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) experiments as input
   information to predict the chemical structures of individual components
   matching the weights in a mixture. NP-StructurePredictor also provides
   the predicted structures with statistically calculated probabilities so
   that the most likely chemical structures of the natural products and
   their analogs can be proposed accordingly. Four data sets consisting of
   different Chinese herbs with mixtures containing known compounds were
   selected for validation studies, and all their components were correctly
   identified and highly predicted using NP-StructurePredictor.
   NP-StructurePredictor demonstrated its applicability for predicting the
   chemical structures of novel compounds by returning highly accurate
   results from four different validation case studies.}},

Abstract = {{Character intention revision is an essential component of stories, but
   it has yet to be incorporated into story generation systems. However,
   intentionality, one component of intention revision, has been explored
   in both narrative generation and logical formalisms. The intention
   revision in storytelling (IRIS) system adopts the
   belief/desire/intention framework of intentionality from logical
   formalisms and combines it with preexisting concepts of intentionality
   in narrative. IRIS also introduces the crucial concept of intention
   revision for the protagonist of the story. The IRIS system uses its
   generative power alongside psychological and narrative models of
   suspense to computationally create suspenseful stories. It has been used
   in the creation of suspenseful noninteractive text stories and an
   interactive text-based video game.}},

Abstract = {{Board games applications usually offer a great user experience when
   running on desktop computers. Powerful high-performance processors
   working without energy restrictions successfully deal with the
   exploration of large game trees, delivering strong play to satisfy
   demanding users. However, nowadays, more and more game players are
   running these games on smartphones and tablets, where the lower
   computational power and limited power budget yield a much weaker play.
   Recent systems-on-a-chip include programmable logic tightly coupled with
   general-purpose processors enabling the inclusion of custom accelerators
   for any application to improve both performance and energy efficiency.
   In this paper, we analyze the benefits of partitioning the artificial
   intelligence of board games into software and hardware. We have chosen
   as case studies three popular and complex board games, Reversi, Blokus,
   and Connect6. The designs analyzed include hardware accelerators for
   board processing, which improve performance and energy efficiency by an
   order of magnitude leading to much stronger and battery-aware
   applications. The results demonstrate that the use of hardware/software
   codesign to develop board games allows sustaining or even improving the
   user experience across platforms while keeping power and energy low.}},

Abstract = {{Multiagent path finding is the problem of finding paths for a set of
   agents-one for each agent-in a graph that the agents navigate
   simultaneously. Agents must navigate from their individual start to goal

   path conflicts in the literature is incomplete for applications, such as
   computer games and crowd simulations, and extend the definition of path
   conflicts to accommodate cases where agents persist in their
   intermediate locations and even after reaching their goals. We show that
   an existing algorithm, conflict-based search (CBS), can be extended to
   handle these cases while preserving its optimality. Experiments show
   that our variant of CBS generates fewer nodes and runs faster than a
   competing algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Communication-based train control (CBTC) systems are automated train
   control systems based on continuous and bidirectional train-ground
   communications. CBTC is the direction of future train control systems.
   Complex channel condition and frequent handoff can severely affect urban
   rail CBTC train-ground communication performance, and consequently
   affect CBTC operation efficiency. Current research regarding CBTC does
   not consider the impact of train-ground communications on train control
   performance. This paper studies the joint optimization of communication
   and control in CBTC systems. With the objective to minimize the optimal
   operation profile tracking error and energy consumption, linear
   quadratic cost is defined as the control performance measure. In order
   to ensure train operation safety, the optimization model puts
   constraints on train control actions related to safety. Moreover, based
   on the stochastic channel characteristics and the real-time train
   position information, handoff decision and train control policy are
   jointly optimized using deep reinforcement learning. Extensive
   simulation results based on real-field channel measurements illustrate
   that the proposed optimization method can significantly improve the
   train control performance in CBTC systems, and CBTC systems need to
   sacrifice part of performance to ensure system safety.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge graphs have been shown to be useful to many tasks in
   artificial intelligence. Triples of knowledge graphs are traditionally
   structured by human editors or extracted from semi-structured
   information; however, editing is expensive, and semi-structured
   information is not common. On the other hand, most such information is
   stored as text. Hence, it is necessary to develop a method that can
   extract knowledge from texts and then construct or populate a knowledge
   graph; this has been attempted in various ways. Currently, there are two
   approaches to constructing a knowledge graph. One is open information
   extraction (Open IE), and the other is knowledge graph embedding;
   however, neither is without problems. Stanford Open IE, the current best
   such system, requires labeled sentences as training data, and knowledge
   graph embedding systems require numerous triples. Recently, distributed
   representations of words have become a hot topic in the field of natural
   language processing, since this approach does not require labeled data
   for training. These require only plain text, but Mikolov showed that it
   can perform well with the word analogy task, answering questions such
   as, ``a is to b as c is to \_\_?.{''} This can be considered as a
   knowledge extraction task from a text for finding the missing entity of
   a triple. However, the accuracy is not sufficiently high when applied in
   a straightforward manner to relations in knowledge graphs, since the
   method uses only one triple as a positive example. In this paper, we
   analyze why distributed representations perform such tasks well; we also
   propose a new method for extracting knowledge from texts that requires
   much less annotated data. Experiments show that the proposed method
   achieves considerable improvement compared with the baseline; in
   particular, the improvement in HITS@10 was more than doubled for some
   relations.}},

Abstract = {{This work conducts a feasibility study of deep learning approaches for
   automatic segmentation of left ventricle (LV) cavity from cardiac
   magnetic resonance (CMR) images. Automatic LV cavity segmentation is a
   challenging task, partially due to the small size of the object as
   compared to the large CMR image background, especially at the apex. To
   cater for small object segmentation, the authors present a
   localisation-segmentation framework, to first locate the object in the
   large full image, then segment the object within the small cropped
   region of interest. The localisation is performed by a deep regression
   model based on convolutional neural networks, while the segmentation is
   done by the deep neural networks based on U-Net architecture. They also
   employ the Dice loss function for the training process of the
   segmentation models, to investigate its effects on the segmentation
   performance. The deep learning models are trained and evaluated by using
   public endocardium-annotated CMR datasets from York University and
   MICCAI 2009 LV Challenge websites. The average dice metric values of the
   authors' proposed framework are 0.91 and 0.93, respectively, on these
   two databases. These results are promising as compared to the best
   results achieved by the current state-of-art, which shows the potentials

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel deep learning-based framework for classifying the
   digital mammograms is introduced. The development of this methodology is
   based on deep learning strategies that model the presence of the tumour
   tissues with level sets. It is difficult to robustly segment mammogram
   image due to low contrast between normal and lesion tissues. Therefore,
   Chan-Vese level set method is used to extract the initial contour of
   mammograms and deep learning convolutional neural network (DL-CNN)
   algorithm is used to learn the features of mammary-specific mass and
   microcalcification clusters. To increase the classification accuracy and
   reduce the false positives, a well-known fully complex-valued relaxation
   network classifier is used in the last stage of DL-CNN network.
   Experimental results using the standard benchmarking breast cancer
   dataset (MIAS and BCDR) show that the proposed method exhibits
   significant improvement in performance over the traditional methods.
   Performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC
   achieved are 99\%, 0.9875, 1.0 and 0.9815, respectively. The proposed
   framework performs well in classifying the digital mammograms as normal,
   benign or malignant and its subclasses as well.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, researchers have proposed different feature descriptors to
   achieve robust performance for facial expression recognition (FER).
   However, finding a discriminative feature descriptor remains one of the
   critical tasks. In this paper, we propose a discriminative feature
   learning scheme to improve the representation power of expressions.
   First, we obtain a discriminative feature matrix (DFM) based pixel
   difference representation. Subsequently, all DFMs corresponding to the
   training samples are used to construct a discriminative feature
   dictionary (DFD). Next, DFD is projected on a vertical two-dimensional
   linear discriminant analysis in direction (V-2DLDA) space to compute
   between and within-class scatter because V-2DLDA works well with the DFD
   in matrix representation and achieves good efficiency. Finally, nearest
   neighbor (NN) classifier is used to determine the labels of the query
   samples. DFD represents the local feature changes that are robust to the
   expression, illumination et al. Besides, we exploit V-2DLDA to find an
   optimal projection matrix since it not only protects the discriminative
   features but reduces the dimensions. The proposed method achieves
   satisfying recognition results, reaching accuracy rates as high as
   91.87\% on CK+ database, 82.24\% on KDEF database, and 78.94\% on CMU
   Multi-PIE database in the LOSO scenario, which perform better than other
   comparison methods.}},

Abstract = {{Feature selection and fusion is of crucial importance in multi-feature

   To guarantee a robustness of the sparse representation method, a mixed

Abstract = {{Place classification is a fundamental ability that a robot should
   possess to carry out effective human-robot interactions. In recent
   years, there is a high exploitation of artificial intelligence
   algorithms in robotics applications. Inspired by the recent successes of
   deep learning methods, we propose an end-to-end learning approach for
   the place classification problem. With deep architectures, this
   methodology automatically discovers features and contributes in general
   to higher classification accuracies. The pipeline of our approach is
   composed of three parts. First, we construct multiple layers of laser
   range data to represent the environment information in different levels
   of granularity. Second, each layer of data are fed into a deep neural
   network for classification, where a graph regularization is imposed to
   the deep architecture for keeping local consistency between adjacent
   samples. Finally, the predicted labels obtained from all layers are
   fused based on confidence trees to maximize the overall confidence.
   Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our end-to-end place
   classification framework in which both the multilayer structure and the
   graph regularization promote the classification performance.
   Furthermore, results show that the features automatically learned from
   the raw input range data can achieve competitive results to the features
   constructed based on statistical and geometrical information.}},

Abstract = {{Appliance recognition by a home energy management system (HEMS) is a
   principal challenge in the area of future smart and home grid systems,
   particularly for electrical power load balancing. In this paper, a novel
   HEMS is proposed, with a smart socket outlet that is capable of
   appliance recognition for interworking with a Universal Plug and Play
   (UPnP) network. The proposed method of appliance recognition, which is
   based on a Pearson correlation and a weighted cosine similarity
   technique, significantly increases the accuracy of the recognition
   degree in a real experimental environment. It also requires much less
   computing power and recognition time for appliance identification in
   comparison with various conventional methods based on complex artificial
   intelligence andmachine learning schemes. The proposed system also
   generates a virtual UPnP device interface for the recognized appliance
   to be exposed to the UPnP network. Thus, any appliance plugged into the
   smart socket outlet can utilize the features of the UPnP network even if
   it does not support UPnP functionalities. The proposed system is
   demonstrated by implementing a simple and fast appliance recognition
   unit and a virtual UPnP device generation unit. The experimental results
   show the feasibility of appliance recognition and the capability of
   virtual UPnP device generation having superior performance when compared
   with conventional methods.}},

Abstract = {{The identification problem incorporated in feedback control of uncertain
   nonlinear systems exhibiting complex behavior has been solved in
   different ways. Some of these solutions have used artificial
   intelligence methods like fuzzy logic and neural networks. However,
   their individual implementation suffers from certain drawbacks, such as
   the black-box nature of neural network and the problem of finding
   suitable membership functions for fuzzy systems. These weaknesses can be
   avoided by implementing a hybrid structure combining these two
   approaches, the so-called neuro-fuzzy system. In this paper, a
   neuro-fuzzy system that implements differential neural networks (DNNs)
   as consequences of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy inference rules is
   proposed. The DNNs substitute the local linear systems that are used in
   the common T-S method. In this paper, DNNs are used to provide an
   effective instrument for dealing with the identification of the
   uncertain nonlinear system, while the T-S rules are used to provide the
   framework of previous knowledge of the system. The main idea is to carry
   out an online identification process of an uncertain nonlinear system
   with the aim to design a closed-loop trajectory tracking controller. The
   methodology developed in this study that supports the identification and
   trajectory control designs is based on the Lyapunov formalism. The DNN
   implementation results in a time-varying T-S system. As a consequence,
   the solution of two time-varying Riccati equations was used to adjust
   the learning laws in the DNN as well as to adjust the gains of the
   controller. Two results were provided to justify the existence of
   positive-definite solutions for the class of Riccati equations used in
   the learning laws of DNNs. A complete description of the learning laws
   used for the set of DNN identifiers is also obtained. An autonomous
   underwater vehicle system is used to demonstrate the performance of the
   controller on tracking a desired 3-D path by this combination of the DNN
   and the T-S system.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an experimental platform that uses differential evolution to
   automatically discover high-performance multirotor controllers. All
   control parameters are tuned simultaneously, no modeling is required,
   and, as the evolution occurs on a real multirotor, the controllers are
   guaranteed to work in reality. The platform is able to run back-to-back
   experiments for over a week without human intervention. Self-adaptive
   rates are shown improve solution fitness whilst (at least) maintaining
   convergence times. This platform is the first to allow for evolutionary
   robotics experimentation to occur safely and repeatedly on real
   multirotors. High-performance controllers are evolved despite noisy
   fitness evaluations, real-world sensory noise, low population sizes, and
   limited numbers of evolutionary generations.}},

Title = {{Using artificial intelligence to support compliance with the general
   data protection regulation}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{429-443}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union
   regulation that will replace the existing Data Protection Directive on
   25 May 2018. The most significant change is a huge increase in the
   maximum fine that can be levied for breaches of the regulation. Yet
   fewer than half of UK companies are fully aware of GDPR- and a number of
   those who were preparing for it stopped doing so when the Brexit vote
   was announced. A last- minute rush to become compliant is therefore
   expected, and numerous companies are starting to offer advice,
   checklists and consultancy on how to comply with GDPR. In such an
   environment, artificial intelligence technologies ought to be able to
   assist by providing best advice; asking all and only the relevant
   questions; monitoring activities; and carrying out assessments. The
   paper considers four areas of GDPR compliance where rule based
   technologies and/or machine learning techniques may be relevant:
   Following compliance checklists and codes of conduct; Supporting risk
   assessments; Complying with the new regulations regarding technologies
   that perform automatic profiling; Complying with the new regulations
   concerning recognising and reporting breaches of security. It concludes
   that AI technology can support each of these four areas. The
   requirements that GDPR (or organisations that need to comply with GDPR)
   state for explanation and justification of reasoning imply that rule-
   based approaches are likely to be more helpful than machine learning
   approaches. However, there may be good business reasons to take a
   different approach in some circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{Over last few years, CAPTCHAs are ubiquitously found on internet as a
   security mechanism to distinguish between humans and spams. The
   text-based CAPTCHAs offer users to recognize the distorted text from the
   challenged images. Having based on hard AI problem, they have emerged as
   a hot research topic in computer vision and machine learning. The
   contemporary text-based CAPTCHAs are based on the segmentation problem
   that involves their decomposition into sub-images of individual
   characters. This is a challenging task for current OCR programs which is
   not yet solved to a great extent. In this paper, we present a novel
   segmentation and recognition method which uses simple image processing
   techniques including thresholding, thinning and pixel count methods
   along with an artificial neural network for text-based CAPTCHAs. We
   attack the popular CCT (Crowded Characters Together) based CAPTCHAs and
   compare our results with other schemes. As overall, our system achieves
   an overall precision of 51.3, 27.1 and 53.2\% for Taobao, MSN and eBay
   datasets with 1000,500 and 1000 CAPTCHAs respectively. The benefits of
   this research are twofold: by recognizing text-based CAPTCHAs, we not
   only explore the weaknesses in the current design but also find a way to
   segment and recognize the connected characters from images. The proposed
   algorithm can be used in digitization of ancient books, handwriting
   recognition and other similar tasks.}},

Abstract = {{1965 Lotfi A. Zadeh published ``Fuzzy Sets{''}, his pioneering and
   controversial paper, that now reaches almost 100,000 citations. All
   Zadeh's papers were cited over 185,000 times. Starting from the ideas
   presented in that paper, Zadeh founded later the Fuzzy Logic theory,
   that proved to have useful applications, from consumer to industrial
   intelligent products. We are presenting general aspects of Zadeh's
   contributions to the development of Soft Computing(SC) and Artificial
   Intelligence(AI), and also his important and early influence in the
   world and in Romania. Several early contributions in fuzzy sets theory
   were published by Romanian scientists, such as: Grigore C. Moisil
   (1968), Constantin V. Negoita \& Dan A. Ralescu (1974), Dan Butnariu
   (1978). In this review we refer the papers published in ``From Natural
   Language to Soft Computing: New Paradigms in Artificial Intelligence{''}
   (2008, Eds.: L.A. Zadeh, D. Tufis, F.G. Filip, I. Dzitac), and also from
   the two special issues (SI) of the International Journal of Computers
   Communications \& Control (IJCCC, founded in 2006 by I. Dzitac, F.G.
   Filip \& M.J. Manolescu; L.A. Zadeh joined in 2008 to editorial board).
   In these two SI, dedicated to the 90th birthday of Lotfi A. Zadeh
   (2011), and to the 50th anniversary of ``Fuzzy Sets{''} (2015), were

Abstract = {{Development of rule-based systems is an important research area for
   artificial intelligence and decision making, as rule base is one of the
   most general purpose forms for expressing human knowledge. In this
   paper, a new rule-based representation and its inference method based on
   evidential reasoning are presented based on operational research and
   fuzzy set theory. In this rule base, the uncertainties of human
   knowledge and human judgment are designed with interval certitude
   degrees which are embedded in the antecedent terms and consequent terms.
   The knowledge representation and inference framework offer an
   improvement of the recently developed rule base inference method, and
   the evidential reasoning approach is still applied to the rule fusion.
   It is noteworthy that the uncertainties will be defined and modeled
   using interval certitude degrees. In the end, an illustrative example is
   provided to illustrate the proposed knowledge representation and
   inference method as well as demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing
   with some existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Choosing a career affects individuals' social life deeply in terms of
   many dimensions. However, choosing the right career is becoming
   increasingly difficult given the existence of an increasing number of
   professions and training opportunities. Consequently, the importance of
   career orientation increases. In this study, a system that can
   automatically offer vocational guidance has been developed. This new
   system is referred to as WEB-CGS (web-based carrier guidance system) and
   works as a fuzzy logic based web service. The aim is that it will make
   it easier for an individual to choose the right profession. In this
   system, students' prior educational successes and teachers' views were
   integrated in a manner which made it possible to identify the students'
   professional interests and capacities. The system forecasts vocational
   school students' interest with regard to Information Technology,
   Electrics-Electronics, Accounting, and Automotive. Promising results
   were obtained with regard to 300 unbiased 9th grade students in terms of
   orienting them towards an appropriate profession.}},

Abstract = {{The use of artificial neural networks as the objective function of
   optimization algorithms is proposed in the recent past. In this paper,
   the use of artificial neural networks ensemble as objective function in
   place of single artificial neural networks is proposed. An ensemble
   hybrid algorithm is developed by using artificial neural networks and
   bacterial foraging optimization algorithm technique for designing a
   fractal antenna of a rectenna system working at 2.45 GHz. The closed
   form expressions are not available for the fractal antennas, so the use
   of artificial intelligence techniques for their design is appropriate.
   As the size reduction in rectenna systems used in wireless devices is a
   significant research domain to meet the demand for reduced size handheld
   devices, so the geometry of the antenna is selected to achieve this
   objective and a size reduction of 34.39 \% is attained. The bandwidth
   enhancement of the proposed antenna is also achieved so that it can be
   used over wide band. The performance of the proposed optimized fractal
   antenna is verified using simulation and experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{The management of river water quality is one the most significant
   environmental challenges. Water quality index (WQI) describes several
   water quality variables at a certain aquatic environment and time.
   Classically, WQI is commonly computed using the traditional methods
   which involved lengthy computation, consume timing and occasionally
   associated with accidental errors during subindex calculation. Thus,
   providing an accurate prediction model for WQI is highly required.
   Recently, the artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been examined for
   similar prediction applications and exhibited a remarkable ability to
   capture the nonlinearity pattern between predictors and predictand. In
   the current research, two different ANN algorithms, namely radial basis
   function neural network (RBFNN) and back propagation neural networks
   models, have been applied to examine and mimic the relationship of WQI
   with the water quality variables in a tropical environment (Malaysia).
   The input variables categorized into two different architectures and
   have been inspected. In addition, comprehensive analysis for the
   performance evaluation and the sensitivity analysis of the variables
   have been conducted. The results achieved are positively promising with
   high performance accuracy belonging to RBFNN model for both scenarios.
   Furthermore, the proposed approach offers an effective alternative to
   compute and predict WQI, to the fact that WQI manual calculation methods
   involved lengthy computations, transformations, use of various subindex
   formulae for each value of the constituent water quality variables, and
   consuming time.}},

Abstract = {{The scientific interest attracted by Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) has
   lead to the development of tools for the simulation and study of
   neuronal dynamics ranging from phenomenological models to the more
   sophisticated and biologically accurate Hodgkin-and-Huxley-based and
   multi-compartmental models. However, despite the multiple features
   offered by neural modelling tools, their integration with environments
   for the simulation of robots and agents can be challenging and time
   consuming. The implementation of artificial neural circuits to control
   robots generally involves the following tasks: (1) understanding the
   simulation tools, (2) creating the neural circuit in the neural
   simulator, (3) linking the simulated neural circuit with the environment
   of the agent and (4) programming the appropriate interface in the robot
   or agent to use the neural controller. The accomplishment of the
   above-mentioned tasks can be challenging, especially for undergraduate
   students or novice researchers. This paper presents an alternative tool
   which facilitates the simulation of simple SNN circuits using the
   multi-agent simulation and the programming environment Netlogo
   (educational software that simplifies the study and experimentation of
   complex systems). The engine proposed and implemented in Netlogo for the
   simulation of a functional model of SNN is a simplification of integrate
   and fire (I\&F) models. The characteristics of the engine (including
   neuronal dynamics, STDP learning and synaptic delay) are demonstrated
   through the implementation of an agent representing an artificial insect
   controlled by a simple neural circuit. The setup of the experiment and
   its outcomes are described in this work.}},

Abstract = {{The power quality analysis represents an important aspect in the overall

   systems is typically performed in two steps: disturbance detection and
   disturbance classification. Disturbance detection is usually made
   through space transform techniques, and their classification is usually
   performed through artificial intelligence methods. The problem with
   those approaches is the adequate selection of parameters for these
   techniques. Due to the advantages of a variant scheme known as the
   micro-genetic algorithms, in this investigation, a new methodology to
   directly detect and classify electrical disturbances in one step is
   developed. The proposed approach is validated through synthetic signals
   and experimental test on real data, and the obtained results are
   compared with the particle swarm optimization method in order to show
   the effectiveness of this methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in human-centric technologies, such as artificial intelligence
   (AI), application-oriented sensing and smart home, along with recent
   developments in internet of things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M)
   networks are enabling the design and development of a smarter home with
   cognitive intelligence. In this paper, we first investigate the
   integration of smart home and botanical IoT for creating a better living
   environment to increase people's quality of life. First, we point out
   that traditional smart home solution (Smart Home 1.0) only achieves the
   interaction between users and home appliances in indoor environment,
   while ignoring the relation between users and indoor greeneries. Then,
   we discuss the benefits of indoor greeneries for improving indoor living
   environment which leads a better physical health and mental health for
   home users. As greeneries are integrated into Smart Home 1.0, we propose
   an evolution from traditional smart home solution to Smart Home 2.0 to
   achieve the organic integration between users and greeneries. To verify
   our proposal, a prototype system of Smart Home 2.0 is designed and
   implemented. The experimental results show the smooth data flows from
   sensors deployed in smart green house to data center. A mobile cloud
   system is built to store, manage and visualize the data for the
   affective interaction between greeneries and home users. It is
   foreseeable that the emotion-aware capability of smart home 2.0 will
   bring more intelligent and interactive healthcare applications for urban
   residents in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Deep neural network (DNN) has emerged as a powerful machine learning
   technique for various artificial intelligence applications. Due to the
   unique advantages on speed, area, and power, specific hardware design
   has become a very attractive solution for the efficient deployment of
   DNN. However, the huge resource cost of multipliers makes the
   fully-parallel implementations of multiplication-intensive DNN still
   very prohibitive in many real-time resource-constrained embedded
   applications. This brief proposes a fully-parallel area-efficient
   stochastic DNN design. By leveraging stochastic computing (SC)
   technique, the computations of DNN are implemented using very simple
   stochastic logic, thereby enabling low-complexity fully-parallel DNN
   design. In addition, to avoid the accuracy loss incurred by the
   approximation of SC, we propose an accuracy-aware DNN datapath
   architecture to retain the test accuracy of stochastic DNN. Moreover, we
   propose a novel low-complexity architecture for the binary-to-stochastic
   (B-to-S) interface to drastically reduce the footprint of the peripheral
   B-to-S circuit. Experimental results show that the proposed stochastic
   DNN design achieves much better hardware performance than non-stochastic
   design with negligible test accuracy loss.}},

Abstract = {{Given the tremendous growth of sport fans, the ``Intelligent Arena{''},

   automatically select the camera to give high-quality broadcast in
   real-time. Furthermore, with basketball energy image based deep
   conventional neural network, we can detect the scoring clips as the
   highlight video reels to support the wonderful actions replay and online
   sharing functions. Finally, evaluations on a built real-world basketball
   match dataset demonstrate that the proposed system can obtain 94.59\%
   accuracy with only less than 45m s processing time (i.e., 10m s
   broadcast camera selection, and 35m s for scoring detection) for each
   frame. As the outstanding performance, the proposed deep learning based
   basketball video analysis scheme is implemented into a commercial
   intelligent basketball arena application named ``Standz Basketball{''}.
   Although the application had been only released for one month, it
   achieves the 85t h day download ranking place in the sport category of
   Chinese iTunes market.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass is a renewable and sustainable source of ``green{''} energy. The
   elemental composition comprising carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O)
   as major components, is an important measure of the biomass fuel's
   energy content. Its knowledge is also valuable in: (a) computing
   material balance in a biomass-based process, (b) designing and operating
   biomass utilizing efficient and clean combustors, gasifiers and boilers,
   (c) fixing the quantity of oxidants required for biomass
   combustion/gasification, and (d) determining the volume and composition
   of the combustion/gasification gases. Obtaining the elemental
   composition of a biomass fuel via ultimate analysis is an expensive and
   time-consuming task. In comparison, proximate analysis that determines
   fixed carbon, ash, volatile matter and moisture content is a cruder
   characterization of the fuel and easier to perform. Thus, there exists a
   need for models possessing high accuracies for predicting the elemental
   composition of a solid biomass fuel from its proximate analysis
   constituents. Accordingly, this study utilizes three computational
   intelligence (CI) formalisms, namely, genetic programming, artificial
   neural networks and support vector regression, for developing nonlinear
   models for the prediction of C, H and O fractions of solid biomass
   fuels. A large database of 830 biomasses has been used in the stated
   model development. A comparison of the prediction accuracy and
   generalization performance of the nine CI-based models (three each for
   C, H and O) with that of the currently available linear models indicates
   that the CI-based models have consistently and significantly
   outperformed their linear counterparts. The models developed in this
   study have proved to be the best models for the prediction of elemental
   composition of solid biomass fuels from their proximate analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the most requisite tools for power
   system operation analysis. This problem has a complex mathematical
   formulation which is relatively hard to solve. This paper presents a
   swarm intelligence-based approach to solve the OPF problem. The proposed
   approach describes the use of a modified artificial bee colony (ABC)
   algorithm called ABC with global and local neighborhoods (ABCGLN) to
   determine the optimal settings of OPF control variables. ABCGLN is a
   recent modified version of basic ABC algorithm that can handle
   non-differentiable, non-linear, and multi modal objective functions. The
   ABCGLN approach is tested here on the standard IEEE 30-bus test system
   with three different objective functions for minimizing quadratic fuel
   cost function, piecewise quadratic cost function and quadratic cost
   function with valve point effects. The simulation results demonstrate
   the potential of ABCGLN algorithm of finding effective and robust
   quality solutions to solve OPF problem with various objective functions
   for the considered system as compared to those available in the

Abstract = {{Deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently widely used for many
   artificial intelligence (AI) applications including computer vision,
   speech recognition, and robotics. While DNNs deliver state-of-the-art
   accuracy on many AI tasks, it comes at the cost of high computational
   complexity. Accordingly, techniques that enable efficient processing of
   DNNs to improve energy efficiency and throughput without sacrificing
   application accuracy or increasing hardware cost are critical to the
   wide deployment of DNNs in AI systems. This article aims to provide a
   comprehensive tutorial and survey about the recent advances toward the
   goal of enabling efficient processing of DNNs. Specifically, it will
   provide an overview of DNNs, discuss various hardware platforms and
   architectures that support DNNs, and highlight key trends in reducing
   the computation cost of DNNs either solely via hardware design changes
   or via joint hardware design and DNN algorithm changes. It will also
   summarize various development resources that enable researchers and
   practitioners to quickly get started in this field, and highlight
   important benchmarking metrics and design considerations that should be
   used for evaluating the rapidly growing number of DNN hardware designs,
   optionally including algorithmic codesigns, being proposed in academia
   and industry. The reader will take away the following concepts from this
   article: understand the key design considerations for DNNs; be able to
   evaluate different DNN hardware implementations with benchmarks and
   comparison metrics; understand the tradeoffs between various hardware
   architectures and platforms; be able to evaluate the utility of various
   DNN design techniques for efficient processing; and understand recent
   implementation trends and opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{The worldwide presence of AI needs to be quantified. This study proposes
   a descriptive approach and the use of multiple methods and data. An
   extensive electronic corpus of books was utilized to see the worldwide
   drift of intellectuals' minds toward AI and identified related terms,
   their future trends, and convergence. Using the best bigram proposed by
   Ngrams Viewer, this study explores the human mind through Google query
   data, linking popular regions, countries, and related topics to the
   concept of AI. URL datasets were collected using two popular search
   engines (SEs), Google and Google Scholar (GS). A URL analysis identified
   key entities (organizations, institutes, and countries) and their yearly
   trends. Top-level domains revealed the global web ecology and the annual
   information growth of AI in SE environments. Information gathered
   through one approach was fed into the other, revealing a complementary
   relationship. AI is popular across the globe, and has left traces in
   many different countries. In this field, GS dominates Google, in
   relation to the number of sites and domains it includes. Top results
   reveal the popularity of AI among professionals, artists, programmers,
   and researchers. The pros and cons of the approaches are also discussed.
   In addition, this study aims to predict the impact of AI on society, as
   interpreted through the lenses of well-established theories. The
   dominance of AI may trap society into aspiring toward an easy life,
   dependent on intelligent machines. Consistent policies are needed to
   smooth out future economic cycles in the AI field.}},

Abstract = {{Although Differential Evolution (DE) is a simple yet powerful
   evolutionary algorithm, it requires an adaptive parameter control to
   achieve its optimal performance. In this paper, DE with an adaptive
   parameter control using the -stable distribution is proposed. First, the
   proposed algorithm allocated a carefully calculated stable distribution,
   evaluated by an adaptation manner, to each individual. After that, each
   individual adjusts its own control parameters by using the assigned
   stable distribution. Thus, we propose a parameter control scheme that
   adapts the stability parameter of the -stable distribution to allocate
   proper stable distributions to each individual, used for tuning control
   parameters. We compared the optimization performances of the proposed
   algorithm with conventional DE and state-of-the-art DE variants at 30
   and 100 dimensions of conventional benchmark problems. Also, we
   evaluated the optimization performances at high dimensional problems
   i.e., 100, 200, and 300 dimensions of CEC2008 benchmark problems. Our
   experiment results showed that the proposed algorithm is able to
   discover better final solutions than the compared DE algorithms and has
   the robust performance at both lower and higher dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Robotic is a great substitute for human to explore the dangerous areas,
   and will also be a great help for disaster management. Although the rise
   of depth sensor technologies gives a huge boost to robotic vision
   research, traditional approaches cannot be applied to disaster-handling
   robots directly due to some limitations. In this paper, we focus on the
   3D robotic perception, and propose a view-invariant Convolutional Neural
   Network (CNN) Model for scene understanding in disaster scenarios. The
   proposed system is highly distributed and parallel, which is of great
   help to improve the efficiency of network training. In our system, two
   individual CNNs are used to, respectively, propose objects from input
   data and classify their categories. We attempt to overcome the
   difficulties and restrictions caused by disasters using several
   specially-designed multi-task loss functions. The most significant
   advantage in our work is that the proposed method can learn a
   view-invariant feature with no requirement on RGB data, which is
   essential for harsh, disordered and changeable environments.
   Additionally, an effective optimization algorithm to accelerate the
   learning process is also included in our work. Simulations demonstrate
   that our approach is robust and efficient, and outperforms the
   state-of-the-art in several related tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Operational research has made meaningful contributions to practical
   forecasting in organizations. An area of substantial activity has been
   in nonlinear modeling. Based on Particle Swarm Optimization, we discuss
   a nonlinear method where a self-adaptive approach, named as Particle
   Swarm Optimization with aging and weakening factors, was applied to
   training a Focused Time Delay Neural Network. Three freely available
   benchmark datasets were used to demonstrate the features of the proposed
   approach compared to the Backpropagation algorithm, Differential
   Evolution and the Particle Swarm Optimization method when applied for
   training the artificial neural network. Even acknowledging that the
   effort in comparing methods across multiple empirical datasets is
   certainly substantial, the proposed algorithm was used to produce 30
   min, 1, 3 and 6 h ahead predictions of wind speed at one site in Brazil.
   The use of the proposed algorithm goes further than only training the
   artificial neural network, but also searching the best number of hidden
   neurons and number of lags. The results have shown that the modified
   Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm obtained better results in all
   predictions horizons, and the use of it has remarkably reduced the
   training time.}},

Abstract = {{Live virtual machine migration can have a major impact on how a cloud

   network aware live migration strategy that monitors the current demand
   level of bandwidth when network congestion occurs and performs
   appropriate actions based on what it is experiencing. The Artificial
   Intelligence technique that is based on Reinforcement Learning acts as a
   decision support system, enabling an agent to learn an optimal time to
   schedule a virtual machine migration depending on the current bandwidth
   usage in a data centre. We show from our results that an autonomous

   when network saturation occurs at peak times.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm based

   These two problems falls under the category of ring loading problems.
   Given a set of data transfer demands between different pair of nodes,
   the first problem consists in routing the demands on the ring in either
   clockwise or counter-clockwise directions so that the maximum data
   transmitted through any link in either directions is minimized. The
   second problem, on the other hand, discriminates between the data
   transmitted in one direction from the other and consists in minimizing
   the maximum data transmitted in one particular direction through any
   link. The first problem is referred to as weighted ring edge-loading
   problem in the literature, whereas the latter as weighted ring
   arc-loading problem. Computational results on the standard benchmark
   instances show the effectiveness of our approaches on both the problems.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Can we model and estimate interest? In general, when an individual
   engages with an object, say Facebook, Instagram, a Mobile game, or
   anything else, we know that there is some interest that the person has
   in the object. However, we do not have a procedure that can tell us by
   ``how much{''} of a factor is the person interested. Simply put, can we
   find a ``number{''} for someone's interest? In this article, we propose
   the design of a framework that can handle this issue. We formulate the
   interest estimation problem as a state estimation problem and deduce
   interest indirectly from the activity. Activity, stimulated by interest,
   is measured via a subjective-objective weighted approach. Further, we
   present a novel continuous-time model for interest by drawing
   inspiration from Physics and Economics simultaneously. We model interest
   along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in Physics and improve the
   performance by borrowing ideas from Stochastic Volatility Models in
   Economics. Subsequently, we employ particle filter to solve the interest
   estimation problem. To validate the feasibility of the proposed theory
   in practice, we investigate the model by conducting numerical
   simulations on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate good
   performance of the framework, and thus match the theoretical
   expectations from the method. Lastly, we implement the framework in
   practice and deploy it as a RESTful service, thereby providing a uniform
   interface for accessing the procedure via any remote or local
   application.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes several approaches to assessing student

   of a multiple-document inquiry activity on a scientific topic (global
   warming). The current work attempts to capture the causal structure of
   student explanations as a way to detect the quality of the students'
   mental models and understanding of the topic by combining approaches
   from Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence, and applying them to
   Education. First, several attributes of the explanations are explored by
   hand coding and leveraging existing technologies (LSA and Coh-Metrix).
   Then, we describe an approach for inferring the quality of the
   explanations using a novel, two-phase machine-learning approach for
   detecting causal relations and the causal chains that are present within
   student essays. The results demonstrate the benefits of using a
   machine-learning approach for detecting content, but also highlight the
   promise of hybrid methods that combine ML, LSA and Coh-Metrix approaches
   for detecting student understanding. Opportunities to use automated
   approaches as part of Intelligent Tutoring Systems that provide feedback
   toward improving student explanations and understanding are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, there is no structured data standard for representing

   are websites dedicated to individual universes, the information found on
   these sites separate out the various formats, concentrate on only the
   bibliographic aspects of the material, and are only searchable with full
   text. We have created an ontological model that will allow various user
   groups interested in transmedia to search for and retrieve the
   information contained in these worlds based upon their structure. We
   conducted a domain analysis and user studies based on the contents of
   Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, the Marvel Universe, and Star Wars in
   order to build a new model using Ontology Web Language (OWL) and an
   artificial intelligence-reasoning engine. This model can infer
   connections between transmedia properties such as characters, elements
   of power, items, places, events, and so on. This model will facilitate
   better search and retrieval of the information contained within these
   vast story universes for all users interested in them. The result of
   this project is an OWL ontology reflecting real user needs based upon
   user research, which is intuitive for users and can be used by

Abstract = {{Discovery in mathematics is a prototypical intelligent behavior, and an
   early and continuing goal of artificial intelligence research. We
   present a heuristic for producing mathematical conjectures of a certain
   typical form and demonstrate its utility. Our program conjectures
   relations that hold between properties of objects (property-relation
   conjectures). These objects can be of a wide variety of types. The
   statements are true for all objects known to the program, and are the
   simplest statements which are true of all these objects. The examples
   here include new conjectures for the hamiltonicity of a graph, a
   well-studied property of graphs. While our motivation and experiments
   have been to produce mathematical conjectures-and to contribute to
   mathematical research-other kinds of interesting property-relation
   conjectures can be imagined, and this research may be more generally
   applicable to the development of intelligent machinery.}},

Title = {{A segmentation method based on HMRF for the aided diagnosis of acute
   myeloid leukemia}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
   is purely dependent on counting the percentages of blasts (> 20\%) in
   the peripheral blood or bone marrow. Manual microscopic examination of
   peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate smears is time consuming and
   less accurate. The first and very important step in blast recognition is
   the segmentation of the cells from the background for further cell
   feature extraction and cell classification. In this paper, we aimed to
   utilize computer technologies in image analysis and artificial
   intelligence to develop an automatic program for blast recognition and
   counting in the aspirate smears.
   Methods: We proposed a method to analyze the aspirate smear images,
   which first performs segmentation of the cells by k-means cluster, then
   builds cell image representing model by HMRF (Hidden-Markov Random
   Field), estimates model parameters through probability of EM
   (expectation maximization), carries out convergence iteration until
   optimal value, and finally achieves second stage refined segmentation.
   Furthermore, the segmentation results are compared with several other
   methods using six classes of cells respectively.
   Results: The proposed method was applied to six groups of cells from 61
   bone marrow aspirate images, and compared with other algorithms for its
   performance on the analysis of the whole images, the segmentation of
   nucleus, and the efficiency of calculation. It showed improved
   segmentation results in both the cropped images and the whole images,
   which provide the base for down-stream cell feature extraction and
   identification.
   Conclusions: Segmentation of the aspirate smear images using the
   proposed method helps the analyst in differentiating six groups of cells
   and in the determination of blasts counting, which will be of great
   significance for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{We are currently on a verge of a revolution in digital photography.
   Developments in computational imaging and adoption of artificial
   intelligence have spawned new editing techniques that give impressive
   results in astonishingly short time -frames. The advent of multi-sensor
   and multi-lens cameras will further challenge many existing integrity
   verification techniques. As a result, it will be necessary to
   re-evaluate our notion of image authenticity and look for new techniques
   that could work efficiently in this new reality. The goal of this paper
   is to thoroughly review existing techniques for protection and
   verification of digital image integrity. In contrast to other recent
   surveys, the discussion covers the most important developments both in
   active protection and in passive forensic analysis techniques. Existing
   approaches are analyzed with respect to their capabilities, fundamental
   limitations, and prospective attack vectors. Whenever possible, the
   discussion is supplemented with real operation examples and a list of
   available implementations. Finally, the paper reviews resources
   available in the research community, including public data-sets and
   commercial or open-source software. The paper concludes by discussing
   relevant developments in computational imaging and highlighting future

Abstract = {{An evaluation and choice of learning algorithms is a current research
   area in data mining, artificial intelligence and pattern recognition,

   literature. There is a need for selecting the best suitable learning
   algorithm for a given data. With the information explosion of different
   learning algorithms and the changing data scenarios, there is a need of
   smart learning system. The paper shows one approach where past
   experiences learned are used to suggest the best suitable learner using
   3 meta-features namely simple, statistical and information theoretic
   features. The system tests 38 UCI benchmark datasets from various
   domains using nine classifiers from various categories. It is observed
   that for 29 datasets, i.e., 76 \% of datasets, both the predicted and
   actual accuracies directly match. The proposed approach is found to be
   correct for algorithm selection of these datasets. New proposed equation
   of finding classifier accuracy based on meta-features is determined and
   validated. The study compares various supervised learning algorithms by
   performing tenfold cross-validation paired t test. The work helps in a

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, which has explicit strategies to
   balance intensification and diversification, is a smart swarm
   intelligence algorithm and was first proposed for continuous
   optimization problems. In this paper, a hybrid discrete ABC algorithm,
   which uses acceptance criterion of threshold accepting method, is
   proposed for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). A new solution updating
   equation, which can learn both from other bees and from features of
   problem at hand, is designed for the TSP. Aiming to enhance its ability
   to escape from premature convergence, employed bees and onlooker bees
   use threshold acceptance criterion to decide whether or not to accept
   newly produced solutions. Systematic experiments were performed to show
   the advantage of the new solution updating equation, to verify the
   necessity of using non-greedy acceptance strategy for keeping sufficient
   diversity, to compare different selection schemes for onlooker bees, and
   to analyze the contribution of scout bee. Comparison experiments
   performed on a wide range of benchmark TSP instances have shown that the
   proposed algorithm is better than other ABC-based algorithms and is
   better than or competitive with many other state-of-the-art algorithms.

   machine learning communities, as the class-imbalanced problem
   deteriorates the performance of numerous classifiers. This study
   introduces a two-stage intelligent data preprocessing approach to tackle

   support vector machine (SVM), the discriminating boundary will move
   toward the majority class and in turn misclassify the majority class
   examples as minority class examples. That is, more misclassifications
   for the majority class examples are equivalent to a greater number of
   minority class examples. Executing the SVM as a preprocessor can be used
   to overcome the class imbalanced problem. Sequentially, the modified
   dataset undergoes the random forest to defy the curse of dimensionality.
   Finally, the preprocessed data are fed into a rule-based classifier to

   model selection based on self-adaptive cohort intelligence}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{118-131}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This research proposes a new hybrid approach for feature selection and
   Support Vector Machine (SVM) model selection based on a new variation of
   Cohort Intelligence (CI) algorithm. Feature selection can improve the
   accuracy of classification algorithms and reduce their computation
   complexity by removing the irrelevant and redundant features. SVM is a
   classification algorithm that has been used in many areas, such as
   bioinformatics and pattern recognition. However, the classification
   accuracy of SVM depends mainly on tuning its hyperparameters (i.e., SVM
   model selection). This paper presents a framework that is comprised of
   the following two major components. First, Self-Adaptive Cohort
   Intelligence (SACI) algorithm is proposed, which is a new variation of
   the emerging metaheuristic algorithm, Cohort Intelligence (CI). Second,
   SACI is integrated with SVM resulting in a new hybrid approach referred
   to as SVM SACI for simultaneous feature selection and SVM model
   selection. SACI differs from CI by employing tournament based mutation
   and self-adaptive scheme for sampling interval and mutation rate.
   Furthermore, SACI is both real-coded and binary-coded, which makes it
   directly applicable to both binary and continuous domains. The
   performance of SACI for feature selection and SVM model selection was
   examined using ten benchmark datasets from the literature and compared
   with those of CI and five well-known metaheuristics, namely, Genetic
   Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential
   Evolution (DE) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). The comparative results
   demonstrate that SACI outperformed CI and comparable to or better than
   the other compared metaheuristics in terms of the SVM classification
   accuracy and dimensionality reduction. In addition, SACI requires less
   tuning efforts as the number of its control parameters is less than
   those of the other compared metaheuristics due to adopting the
   self-adaptive scheme in SACI. Finally, this research suggests employing
   more efficient methods for high-dimensional or large datasets due to the
   relatively high training time required by search strategies based on
   metaheuristics when applied to such datasets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A power transformer is one of the most important components in a
   transmission network. To assess the overall condition of this valuable
   asset, health index calculations are recently gaining more attention
   from the utility companies that operate networks. Only limited research
   has been conducted on health index calculations of transformers. Most of
   the past approaches are based on the linear combination of weighted
   scores of measurements following the industry standards such as IEEE,
   IEC and CIGRE. A few previous methods based on artificial intelligence
   and statistical approaches such as fuzzy logic, multivariate analysis
   and binary logistic regression have been published in recent years. In
   this paper, a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) which has a nice
   nonlinear property and can work with measurements without quantization
   has been evaluated. The GRNN allows multi-dimensional measurements to be
   combined through an optimal weighting and scoring system to compute a
   quantitative health index of power transformers. The weighting of each
   test was assigned based on a smoothly interpolated continuous function.
   The efficacy of the model has been validated against expert
   classifications and data sets published in the literature. The
   comparative results demonstrate that, the proposed method is reliable
   and very effective for condition assessment of transformers through an
   automated health index calculation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Dynamic resource allocation (DRA) problems constitute an important class
   of dynamic stochastic optimization problems that arise in many
   real-world applications. DRA problems are notoriously difficult to solve
   since they combine stochastic dynamics with intractably large state and
   action spaces. Although the artificial intelligence and operations
   research communities have independently proposed two successful
   frameworks for solving such problems Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and
   rolling horizon optirhization (RHO), respectively the relative merits of
   these two approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we adapt
   MCTS and RHO to two problems - a problem inspired by tactical wildfire
   management and a classical problem involving the control of queueing
   networks - and undertake an extensive computational study comparing the
   two methods on large scale instances of both problems in terms of both
   the state and the action spaces. Both methods are able to greatly
   improve on a baseline, problem-specific heuristic. On smaller instances,
   the MCTS and RHO approaches perform comparably, but RHO outperforms MCTS
   as the size of the problem increases for a, fixed computational budget.

Abstract = {{Precise knowledge of faults is very exigent to reduce the outage
   duration as most of the customer minute losses in distribution grids
   occur due to longer period of interruptions caused by faults. This study
   proposes a fault location technique combining advanced signal processing
   and machine learning tools for distribution grids. The proposed
   technique decomposes three-phase currents measured from sending end
   employing wavelet transform (WT) and collects useful features to fetch
   them as inputs of extreme learning machine (ELM). Satisfactory values of
   the selected statistical performance measures validate the efficacy of
   proposed fault location technique. Besides, the efficacy of support
   vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural network (ANN) are also
   tested employing the WT extracted features. The presented results show
   the superiority of ELM-WT technique over SVR-WT and ANN-WT techniques in
   terms of the selected performance measures and training times.
   Additionally, the proposed technique is independent of fault resistance,
   inception angle, the presence of measurement noise, thermal
   expansion/contraction of the distribution line and pre-fault loading
   condition. Furthermore, the hybrid method detects and classifies
   different types of faults before locating them with different machine
   learning tools.}},

Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{291-303}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) combines rule-based and statistical
   artificial intelligence methods, by learning a hypothesis comprising.a
   set of rules given background knowledge and constraints for the search
   space. We focus on extending the XHAIL algorithm for ILP which is based
   on Answer Set Programming and we evaluate our extensions using the
   Natural Language Processing application of sentence chunking. With
   respect to processing natural language, ILP can cater for the constant
   change in how we use language on a daily basis. At the same time, ILP
   does not require huge amounts of training examples such as other
   statistical methods and produces interpretable results, that means a set
   of rules, which can be analysed and tweaked if necessary. As
   contributions we extend XHAIL with (i) a pruning mechanism within the
   hypothesis generalisation algorithm which enables learning from larger
   datasets, (ii) a better usage of modern solver technology using recently
   developed optimisation methods, and (iii) a time budget that permits the
   usage of suboptimal results. We evaluate these improvements on the task
   of sentence chunking using three datasets from a recent SemEval
   competition. Results show that our improvements allow for learning on
   bigger datasets with results that are of similar quality to
   state-of-the-art Systems on the same task. Moreover, we compare the
   hypotheses obtained on datasets to gain insights on the structure of
   each dataset. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{53}},

Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{A novel target recognition method is proposed for high-range resolution
   profiles (HRRPs) of radar targets under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   conditions. This method achieves good recognition performance for noisy
   HRRPs with discriminative sparse-low-rank representation. The framework
   of this method is constructed based on sparse representation and
   low-rank representation, which are applied to extract the local and
   global characteristics of target HRRPs. To guarantee the noise-robust
   and highly discriminative features of the HRRPs, dictionary learning is
   adopted. In the training stage, a discriminative dictionary is produced
   based on hinge loss theory to improve the recognition performance.
   Denoising dictionary optimisation is implemented for noise suppression
   during the testing stage. Experimental results on measured HRRP data
   demonstrate that the proposed method can recover the original HRRPs and
   significantly improve the recognition performance for HRRP test samples
   under relatively low SNR conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Ontology, as an effective structured information storage,

   calculate the similarity between concepts, so as to obtain the potential
   information of each other. In this paper, we present the boosting based
   iterative learning algorithm to compute the ontology sparse vector, and
   thus get the ontology function which maps each ontology concept to a
   real number. Since the advantage of ontology sparse vector is
   dimensionality reduction, the algorithm can extract the key information
   from the high dimensional ontology representation data. At last, we
   select four classical ontologies to test the efficiency of new ontology

Abstract = {{The paper presents a new bi-level optimization framework for optimal

   subjected to various system security constraints. An
   artificial-intelligence based optimal management of BESS is proposed for
   effective control of high renewable power generation. Due to the high
   investment and running costs of BESS, minimum storage capacity has been
   ensured in planning stage. In order to show the effectiveness of the

   Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator Driven Directly by Variable Speed
   Wind Turbine: A Review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The large power penetration of wind farms into the power grids requires
   new regulations by transmission system operators to keep them connected
   to the grid as long as possible. Grid disturbances such as voltage dips
   cause islanding of wind farms on the way to protect its apparatus from
   damage due to a high current flowing. The grid stability will suffer due
   to the islanding of large scale wind farms. Wind farms should keep on
   connecting to the grid during low voltages for a specific time (low
   voltage ride through (LVRT) capability) to support the grid stability
   restoring. LVRT capability of permanent magnet synchronous generator
   driven directly by a variable speed wind turbine (PMSG-VSWT) can be
   realized by modifying the control of grid side converter (GSC), machine
   side converter (MSC), pitch angle control, or using the existing Energy
   storage system (ESS). This paper presents a review of recent proposed
   improvements to enhance the LVRT capability of PMSG-VSWT. Many
   artificial intelligence and conventional controllers are used to enhance
   the control performance during voltage sags to keep the wind farms

   eases the fabrication processes and affords judicious way in large-area,

   feature selection method is based on information-theoretic criteria and
   an optimisation algorithm. The forecasting engine is multilayer

Title = {{Energy efficient routing formation technique for hybrid ad hoc network
   using fusion of artificial intelligence techniques}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid Ad-hoc NETwork (HANET) is a fusion of both the static and dynamic
   topologies. Each node of this network consists of low capacity battery.
   Because of heterogeneous characteristic of the topology, network
   parameters are imprecise in nature. This, in effect, the performance and
   lifetime of the network degrade. To overcome these issues, this paper
   proposes an optimized energy efficient routing (OE2R) method. This
   method is inspired by artificial intelligence techniques such as
   multiobjective optimization, geometric programming, aspiration level,
   and tolerance limit. The fusion of such stated artificial intelligence
   techniques provide an effective tool to optimize multiple conflict
   objectives and estimate imprecise parameters of the network,
   simultaneously. The proposed technique OE2R is simulated using LINGO
   optimization software. To justify the effectiveness of the proposed
   technique, its performance is compared with some existing methods such
   as approximate linear programming technique for average cost bounds and
   linear programming-based efficient message delivery approach in hybrid
   network in several passes of performance metrics. The simulation results
   show that the proposed OE2R method performs much better with the
   comparative methods and may be implemented as energy-efficient routing
   for HANET.}},

Abstract = {{In order to realize artificial intelligence using an electronic device,
   it is obligatory to develop a functional solid-state device that mimics
   synaptic plasticity, analog memory, and forgetting effect exhibited by
   the biological neurons. In this context, the memristor is an ideal
   candidate owing to its nonlinearity, passivity, and in-memory computing
   capabilities. The present work demonstrates the development of a
   bio-mimicking tungsten trioxide (WO3) memristor device using simple and
   costs effective spray pyrolysis method. The performance of the developed
   device was optimized using silver (Ag) doping. Here we show that the
   analog memory, nature of pinched hysteresis loop, synaptic weights,
   resistive switching voltages, and forgetting characteristics of spray
   deposited WO3 memristor can be systematically tuned by appropriate Ag
   doping. The effect of Ag doping on the structural, morphological, and
   electrical characteristics of WO3 memristor devices was also
   investigated. The conduction mechanism of the developed devices follows
   the Ohmic and space charge limited current theories. The results
   presented in this work are helpful for development and optimization of
   WO3 memristor device for the neuromorphic applications. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Enormous potential of Internet of Things (IoT) Technology has made it
   feasible to perceive and analyze real time health conditions in
   ubiquitous manner. Moreover, incorporation of IoT in healthcare industry
   has led researchers around the world to develop smart applications like
   mobile healthcare, health-aware recommendations, and intelligent
   healthcare systems. Inspired from these aspects, this research presents
   an intelligent healthcare framework based on IoT Technology to provide
   ubiquitous healthcare to person during his/her workout sessions. The
   intelligence of the presented framework lies with its ability to analyze
   real time health conditions during workouts and predict probabilistic
   health state vulnerability. For predictive purpose, the proposed
   framework indulges the utilization of Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
   model, which is comprised of three phases namely, monitor, learn, and
   predict. In addition to this, the presented framework is supported by a
   mathematical foundation to predict probabilistic vulnerability, in terms
   of Probabilistic State of Vulnerability (PSoV). In order to determine
   the validity and applicability of the proposed framework, experiments
   were performed where 5 people with different attributes are monitored
   for 14 days using numerous smart sensors. Results, upon comparison with
   various state-of-the-art techniques, depict that the proposed system is
   superior in performance and is highly effective in delivering healthcare

Abstract = {{The development of computational intelligence-based strategies for
   electronic markets has been the focus of intense research. To be able to
   design efficient and effective automated trading strategies, one first
   needs to understand the workings of the market, the strategies that
   traders use, and their interactions as well as the patterns emerging as
   a result of these interactions. In this article, we develop an
   agent-based model of the foreign exchange (FX) market, which is the
   market for the buying and selling of currencies. Our agent-based model
   of the FX market comprises heterogeneous trading agents that employ a
   strategy that identifies and responds to periodic patterns in the price
   time series. We use the agent-based model of the FX market to undertake
   a systematic exploration of its constituent elements and their impact on
   the stylized facts (statistical patterns) of transactions data. This
   enables us to identify a set of sufficient conditions that result in the
   emergence of the stylized facts similarly to the real market data, and
   formulate a model that closely approximates the stylized facts. We use a
   unique high-frequency data set of historical transactions data that
   enables us to run multiple simulation runs and validate our approach and
   draw comparisons and conclusions for each market setting.}},

Abstract = {{Plan similarity measures play a key role in many areas of artificial
   intelligence, such as case-based planning, plan recognition, ambient
   intelligence, or digital storytelling. In this paper, we present 2 novel
   structural similarity measures to compare plans based on a search
   process in the space of partial plans. Partial plans are compact
   representations of sets of plans with some common structure and can be
   organized in a lattice so that the most general partial plans are above
   the most specific ones. To compute our similarity measures, we traverse
   this space of partial plans from the most general to the most specific
   using successive refinements. Our first similarity measure is designed
   for propositional plan formalisms, and the second is designed for
   classical planning formalisms (including variables and types). We also
   introduce 2 novel refinement operators used to traverse the space of
   plans: an ideal downward refinement operator for propositional partial
   plans and a finite and complete downward refinement operator for
   classical partial plans. Finally, we evaluate our similarity measures in
   the context of a nearest neighbor classifier using 2 datasets commonly
   used in the plan recognition literature (Linux and Monroe), showing good
   results in both synthetic and real data.}},

   diagnostic system was developed in Matlab and it was applied to a rotor

   diagnostic system based on full spectra and fuzzy logic is capable of
   identifying with precision different types of faults, which have similar

Abstract = {{Data science plays an increasingly important role in solving today's
   scientific and social challenges. To promote progress toward a cure for
   multiple sclerosis, the Accelerated Cure Project has created an open
   repository of biological and survey data on patients with multiple

   domains. As the open, data-driven model of science proliferates, the
   research community faces a growing need for a cloud platform for
   collaborative data science. Such a platform should facilitate
   collaboration between domain experts and data scientists and possess
   artificial intelligence capabilities for organizing, recommending, and

   technologies motivated by this vision. Our system automatically extracts
   a high-level dataflow graph from a data analysis. This graph describes
   how data flows through an analysis pipeline, including which statistical
   methods are used and how they fit together. The system requires no
   special annotations from the data analyst and consumes analyses written

Abstract = {{Probabilistic programming languages are used for developing statistical
   models. They typically consist of two components: a specification of a
   stochastic process (the prior) and a specification of observations that
   restrict the probability space to a conditional subspace (the
   posterior). Use cases of such formalisms include the development of
   algorithms in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
   In this article, we establish a probabilistic-programming extension of
   Datalog that, on the one hand, allows for defining a rich family of
   statistical models, and on the other hand retains the fundamental
   properties of declarativity. Our proposed extension provides mechanisms
   to include common numerical probability functions; in particular,
   conclusions of rules may contain values drawn from such functions. The
   semantics of a program is a probability distribution over the possible
   outcomes of the input database with respect to the program. Observations
   are naturally incorporated by means of integrity constraints over the
   extensional and intensional relations. The resulting semantics is robust
   under different chases and invariant to rewritings that preserve logical
   equivalence.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is devoted to identification and classification of network
   traffic connections by various hybridization schemes with the goal of
   efficient network attack detection. For this purpose the combination of
   different methods of computational intelligence is used, namely neural
   networks, immune systems, neuro-fuzzy classifiers and support vector
   machines. To increase the speed of processing of input vectors it is
   proposed to apply the method of principal components. A distinctive
   feature and advantage of the approach suggested is a multi-level
   analysis of network traffic, providing the possibility to detect attacks
   by a signature based technique and combining a set of adaptive detectors
   based on computational intelligence methods. The paper describes a
   software tool that is built on the basis of the proposed hybridization
   mechanisms. Computational experiments were carried out that serve as
   evidence of their effectiveness in detection of both known and unknown

Abstract = {{Bioinspired algorithms are search, optimization, and learning techniques
   whose functioning is based on some metaphor of a biological process.
   Prominent examples include evolutionary algorithms and swarm
   intelligence methods. The practical application of these techniques to
   real-world problems typically involves orchestrating the interplay among
   different algorithmic components in order to attain synergistic search
   capabilities. This is a common theme in complex systems, in which the
   whole is more than the sum of the parts due to the complex interaction
   patterns among system components, giving rise to emergent properties not
   anticipated at the base level. Indeed, such systems are prevalent in
   many contexts, both natural (biological systems, ecosystems, etc.) and
   artificial (social networks, finance markets, etc.). Analyzing and
   understanding such systems is not only of the foremost interest, but
   also constitutes in general a formidable task requiring powerful tools.
   Metaheuristics in general and bioinspired algorithms in particular can
   greatly contribute to this end. Furthermore, their intrinsic complex
   nature makes them prone to be also subject of analysis using a

Abstract = {{Artificial Neural Network (ANN) design has long been a complex problem
   because its performance depends heavily on the network topology and
   algorithm to train the set of synaptic weights. Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO) has been the favored optimization algorithm to
   complement ANN, but a thorough literature study has shown that there are
   gaps with current approaches which integrate PSO with ANN, including the
   optimization of network topology and the unreliable weight training
   process. These gaps have caused inferior effect on critical Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) applications and systems, particularly when predicting
   plant machinery and piping failure due to corrosion. The problem of
   corrosion prediction in the oil and gas domain remains unanswered due to
   the lack of a flexible prediction method which targets specific damage
   mechanisms that caused corrosion. This paper proposes a hybrid
   prediction method known as the Adaptive Multilayered Particle Swarm
   Optimized Neural Network (AMPSONN), which integrates several layers of
   PSO to optimize different parameters of the ANN. The multilayered PSO
   enables the method to optimize the network topology and train the set of
   synaptic weights at the same time using a hierarchical optimization
   approach. Through detailed discussion and literature study, the damage
   mechanism focused in this research is the CO2 corrosion and the dataset
   for this research is obtained from the NORSOK empirical model. The
   proposed AMPSONN method is tested against BP, MPSO and PSOBP methods on
   an industrial corrosion dataset for different test conditions. The
   results showed that AMPSONN performs best on all three problems,
   exhibiting high classification accuracies and time efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{To date, the functional application of the flexible organic

   compressive and tensile strain are demonstrated. The current and
   mobility of the device show the nearly linear changes under the tensile
   and compressive strain of < 0.4\%. The dynamic response of the strain
   presents good repeatability. The calculated sensitivity under tensile
   strain is two orders of magnitude higher than the previously reported
   organic thin-film-based strain sensor. It is demonstrated that the

Abstract = {{Multi-Task Learning (MTL) can enhance a classifier's generalization
   performance by learning multiple related tasks simultaneously.
   Conventional MTL works under the offline or batch setting, and suffers
   from expensive training cost and poor scalability. To address such
   inefficiency issues, online learning techniques have been applied to
   solve MTL problems. However, most existing algorithms of online MTL
   constrain task relatedness into a presumed structure via a single weight
   matrix, which is a strict restriction that does not always hold in
   practice. In this paper, we propose a robust online MTL framework that
   overcomes this restriction by decomposing the weight matrix into two
   components: The first one captures the low-rank common structure among
   tasks via a nuclear norm and the second one identifies the personalized
   patterns of outlier tasks via a group lasso. Theoretical analysis shows
   the proposed algorithm can achieve a sub-linear regret with respect to
   the best linear model in hindsight. Even though the above framework
   achieves good performance, the nuclear norm that simply adds all nonzero
   singular values together may not be a good low-rank approximation. To
   improve the results, we use a log-determinant function as a non-convex
   rank approximation. The gradient scheme is applied to optimize
   log-determinant function and can obtain a closed-form solution for this
   refined problem. Experimental results on a number of real-world
   applications verify the efficacy of our method.}},

Abstract = {{The authors present a novel face tracking approach where optical flow
   information is incorporated into a modified version of the Viola-Jones
   detection algorithm. In the original algorithm, detection is static, as
   information from previous frames is not considered; in addition,
   candidate windows have to pass all stages of the classification cascade,
   otherwise they are discarded as containing no face. In contrast, the
   proposed tracker preserves information about the number of
   classification stages passed by each window. Such information is used to
   build a likelihood map, which represents the probability of having a
   face located at that position. Tracking capabilities are provided by
   extrapolating the position of the likelihood map to the next frame by
   optical flow computation. The proposed algorithm works in real time on a
   standard laptop. The system is verified on the Boston Head Tracking
   Database, showing that the proposed algorithm outperforms the standard
   Viola-Jones detector in terms of detection rate and stability of the
   output bounding box, as well as including the capability to deal with
   occlusions. The authors also evaluate two recently published face
   detectors based on convolutional networks and deformable part models
   with their algorithm showing a comparable accuracy at a fraction of the
   computation time.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as expert systems (ESs),
   fuzzy logic (FL), and artificial neural networks (ANNs or NNWs) have
   brought an advancing frontier in power electronics and power
   engineering. These techniques provide powerful tools for design,
   simulation, control, estimation, fault diagnostics, and fault-tolerant
   control in modern smart grid (SG) and renewable energy systems (RESs).
   The AI technology has gone through fast evolution during last several
   decades, and their applications have increased rapidly in modern
   industrial systems. This special issue will remain incomplete without
   some discussion on AI applications in SG and RESs. The paper will
   discuss some novel application examples of AI in these areas. These
   applications are automated design of modern wind generation system and
   its health monitoring in the operating condition, fault pattern
   identification of an SG subsystem, and control of SG based on real-time
   simulator. The concepts of these application examples can be expanded to
   formulate many other applications. In the beginning of the paper, the
   basic features of AI that are relevant to these applications have been
   briefly reviewed.}},

Title = {{Gene expression programming approach for modeling the hydraulic
   performance of labyrinth-channel emitters}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{450-460}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The different hydraulic measures of emitter flow variation (q (var)) and
   manufacturer's coefficient of variation (CVm) at different operating
   pressure (P) and water temperature (T) were determined by measuring the
   discharge of different labyrinth-channel emitters. Gene expression
   programming (GEP) was used to model and predict q(var) and CVm of the
   labyrinth emitters. The structural parameters of each labyrinth emitter
   {[}namely, trapezoidal unit number (N), height (H), and spacing (S), and
   path width (W) and length (L)] as well as P and T were considered as
   independent variables. The accuracy of GEP models was evaluated by their
   coefficient of determination (R-2), root-mean-square error (RMSE),
   overall index of model performance (OI), and mean absolute error (MAE).
   Results of GEP applications established that L and S were the least
   important variables affecting q(var) and CVm, respectively, while N and
   H were the most important variables. For q(var), the GEP(without L)
   model gave higher R-2 and OI and lower RMSE and MAE than those of the
   GEP(without S) model. Conversely, for CVm, R-2 and OI of the GEP(without
   L) model were lower and its RMSE and MAE were higher than the
   corresponding parameters of the GEP(without S) model. Overall, our
   results indicated that the performance of the developed GEP models were
   better at predicting q(var) and CVm for non-pressure-compensating
   emitters than pressure-compensating ones. The GEP approach can be a good
   tool to predict the hydraulic performance of labyrinth emitters.}},

Abstract = {{Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is poised to revolutionize the field

   to play video games directly from pixels. DRL algorithms are also
   applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned
   directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin
   with an introduction to the general field of RL, then progress to the
   main streams of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will
   cover central algorithms in deep RL, including the deep Q-network (DQN),
   trust region policy optimization (TRPO), and asynchronous advantage
   actor critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep
   neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via RL. To conclude,

Abstract = {{This paper discusses means for promoting artificial intelligence (AI)
   that is designed to be safe and beneficial for society (or simply
   ``beneficial AI''). The promotion of beneficial AI is a social challenge
   because it seeks to motivate AI developers to choose beneficial AI
   designs. Currently, the AI field is focused mainly on building AIs that
   are more capable, with little regard to social impacts. Two types of
   measures are available for encouraging the AI field to shift more toward
   building beneficial AI. Extrinsic measures impose constraints or
   incentives on AI researchers to induce them to pursue beneficial AI even
   if they do not want to. Intrinsic measures encourage AI researchers to
   want to pursue beneficial AI. Prior research focuses on extrinsic
   measures, but intrinsic measures are at least as important. Indeed,
   intrinsic factors can determine the success of extrinsic measures.
   Efforts to promote beneficial AI must consider intrinsic factors by
   studying the social psychology of AI research communities.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{573-590}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Given the contemporary ambivalent standpoints toward the future of
   artificial intelligence, recently denoted as the phenomenon of
   Singularitarianism, Gregory Bateson's core theories of ecology of mind,
   schismogenesis, and double bind, are hereby revisited, taken out of
   their respective sociological, anthropological, and psychotherapeutic
   contexts and recontextualized in the field of Roboethics as to a twofold
   aim: (a) the proposal of a rigid ethical standpoint toward both
   artificial and non-artificial agents, and (b) an explanatory analysis of
   the reasons bringing about such a polarized outcome of contradictory
   views in regard to the future of robots. Firstly, the paper applies the
   Batesonian ecology of mind for constructing a unified roboethical
   framework which endorses a flat ontology embracing multiple forms of
   agency, borrowing elements from Floridi's information ethics, classic
   virtue ethics, Felix Guattari's ecosophy, Braidotti's posthumanism, and
   the Japanese animist doctrine of Rinri. The proposed framework wishes to
   act as a pragmatic solution to the endless dispute regarding the nature
   of consciousness or the natural/artificial dichotomy and as a further
   argumentation against the recognition of future artificial agency as a
   potential existential threat. Secondly, schismogenic analysis is
   employed to describe the emergence of the hostile human-robot cultural
   contact, tracing its origins in the early scientific discourse of
   man-machine symbiosis up to the contemporary countermeasures against
   superintelligent agents. Thirdly, Bateson's double bind theory is
   utilized as an analytic methodological tool of humanity's collective
   agency, leading to the hypothesis of collective schizophrenic
   symptomatology, due to the constancy and intensity of confronting
   messages emitted by either proponents or opponents of artificial
   intelligence. The double bind's treatment is the mirroring ``therapeutic
   double bind,'' and the article concludes in proposing the conceptual
   pragmatic imperative necessary for such a condition to follow:
   humanity's conscience of habitualizing danger and familiarization with
   its possible future extinction, as the result of a progressive
   blurrification between natural and artificial agency, succeeded by a
   totally non-organic intelligent form of agency.}},

Title = {{Iterative voting and acyclic games}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{252}},
Pages = {{100-122}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Multi-agent decision problems, in which independent agents have to agree
   on a joint plan of action or allocation of resources, are central to
   artificial intelligence. In such situations, agents' individual
   preferences over available alternatives may vary, and may try to
   reconcile these differences by voting.
   We consider scenarios where voters cannot coordinate their actions, but
   are allowed to change their vote after observing the current outcome, as
   is often the case both in offline committees and in online voting.
   Specifically, we are interested in identifying conditions under which
   such iterative voting processes are guaranteed to converge to a Nash
   equilibrium state-that is, under which this process is acyclic. We
   classify convergence results based on the underlying assumptions about
   the agent scheduler (the order in which the agents take their actions)
   and the action scheduler (the actions available to the agents at each
   step). By so doing, we position iterative voting models within the
   general framework of acyclic games and game forms.
   In more detail, our main technical results provide a complete picture of
   conditions for acyclicity in several variations of Plurality voting. In
   particular, we show that (a) under the traditional lexicographic
   tie-breaking, the game converges from any state and for any order of
   agents, under a weak restriction on voters' actions; and that (b)
   Plurality with randomized tie-breaking is not guaranteed to converge
   under arbitrary agent schedulers, but there is always some path of
   better replies from any initial state of the game to a Nash equilibrium.
   We thus show a first separation between order-free acyclicity and weak
   acyclicity of game forms, thereby settling an open question from {[}7].
   In addition, we refute another conjecture of Kukushkin regarding
   strongly acyclic voting rules, by proving the existence of strongly
   acyclic separable game forms. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{A testbed for evaluating network construction algorithms from GPS traces}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{96-109}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Developing algorithms which construct street/pedestrian networks from
   crowd-sourced GPS traces has been an ongoing research since the outbreak
   of inexpensive GPS receivers on mobile devices. Although, the proposed
   algorithms are evaluated by their developers, the evaluation results
   cannot be used to compare their accuracy because: (a) different
   algorithms target different types of networks, some designed for
   complicated networks while others for simple ones, (b) GPS traces, used
   in different studies, are not the same, some of them are more accurate
   and denser than others, and (c) the constructed networks are evaluated
   either qualitatively or with different quantitative metrics. Lack of a
   comprehensive testbed for evaluating network construction algorithms has
   made it difficult for authors, reviewers, and readers to monitor the
   effectiveness of such algorithms. This study establishes a testbed for
   evaluating network construction algorithms containing three components:
   (a) street and pedestrian networks with different densities and
   complexities as the baseline, (b) collections of GPS traces with
   different accuracies and sampling rates to be used by algorithms to
   construct those networks, and (c) three quantitative metrics to indicate
   the completeness, precision, and topology correctness of the constructed
   network, in addition to the algorithm's time complexity, conventionally
   used to indicate its time performance. This testbed not only paves the
   way for comparing network construction algorithms but also allows
   researchers to focus on their algorithms rather than collecting data for
   testing it or looking for ways to describe its accuracy. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{The machine and plant automation domain is faced with an ever increasing
   demand for ensuring the adaptability of manufacturing facilities in
   context of Industry 4.0. Field level automation software plays a
   dominant role in strengthening the overall flexibility of manufacturing
   resources. Classical programming approaches based typically on
   signal-oriented languages result in disproportionate effort for ensuring
   necessary flexibility. To address this challenge, a novel approach based
   on artificial intelligence planning techniques is presented which is
   able to handle domain specific requirements while facilitating
   efficient, scalable problem solving. Throughout this article, a
   discussion of specific requirements on automated planning techniques for
   field level automation software in the machine and plant automation
   domain with respect to Industry 4.0 is provided. An intensive study on
   existing works and their drawbacks towards addressing these requirements
   is presented. The proposed configurable partial-order planning approach
   is based upon a combination of an adapted goal-based planning
   formulation and its reformulation by means of linear programming
   techniques. It is shown that the proposed approach is able to
   efficiently solve large planning problems by exhibiting positive
   scalability characteristics which indicates its applicability for
   real-size plants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Support vector machines (SVMs) have been successfully used to identify
   individuals' preferences in conjoint analysis. One of the challenges of
   using SVMs in this context is to properly control for preference
   heterogeneity among individuals to construct robust partworths. In this
   work, we present a new technique that obtains all individual utility
   functions simultaneously in a single optimization problem based on three
   objectives: complexity reduction, model fit, and heterogeneity control.
   While complexity reduction and model fit are dealt using SVMs,
   heterogeneity is controlled by shrinking the individual-level partworths
   toward a population mean. The proposed approach is further extended to
   kernel-based machines, conferring flexibility to the model by allowing
   nonlinear utility functions. Experiments on simulated and real-world
   datasets show that the proposed approach in its linear form outperforms
   existing methods for choice-based conjoint analysis.}},

Abstract = {{To study the extent of soil pollution in Shahrood and Damghan located in
   Semnan Province, Iran, 229 soil samples were taken and the levels of 12
   heavy metals (Ag, Co, Pb, Tl, Be, Ni, Cd, Ba, Cu, V, Zn and Cr) were
   analyzed. Elevated values of some heavy metals such as Cr, Ni and V were
   detected in the study area. In order to predict soil pollution index
   (SPI) with respect to the concentration levels of 12 detected heavy
   metals, support vector machines (SVMs) with different kernels (linear,
   RBF and polynomial) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were utilized.
   The database was repeatedly randomly split into training and testing
   data sets, and both SVMs and ANNs were trained and tested for each
   split. The testing results of the support vector regression (SVR) model
   with combinations of parameter sets were compared to optimize the
   parameters of SVMs with different kernels. The out-of-sample
   generalization ability of different kernels was roughly high and the
   same. Therefore, RBF kernel was selected for comparison with ANNs with
   early stopping. The correlation coefficients between the predicted and
   observed SPI for the RBF kernel and ANN with early stopping were 0.997
   and 0.995, implying the same performance of these two methods. The
   results indicated that because of some problems associated with ANNs
   (such as local minima), for cases in which there are quite comparable
   results for ANNs and SVMs, the usage of SVMs is preferable.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical processes are complex dynamic systems. With the chemical
   industry under pressure to introduce improvements through the greater
   use of automation and intelligence, the need for comprehensive
   reliability evaluation has become more urgent both theoretically and
   practically. The employment of intelligent algorithms based on factory
   data has been the recent research hotspots. But for complex systems with
   available data on a smaller scale, reliability evaluation models have
   suffered on such problems as a result of instability and over-fitting,
   which have to be resolved. The GRA-GA-BP-MCRC hybrid algorithm was
   proposed. It combined the two-step genetic algorithm (GA)-back
   propagation (BP) and grey relational analysis (GRA) with Markov chain
   residual correction (MCRC). Based on the technical characteristics and
   the management demands, 46 influential factors of process reliability
   were introduced, which covered man, machine, material, method, and
   environment. For model convergence to be assured, GRA and attribute
   reduction rule were introduced. Meanwhile, based on the correlation of
   the factors, the two-step GA-BP was proposed to resolve the over-fitting
   problem of artificial neural network with complex input parameters. As
   well, MCRC was applied to modify the GA-BP error. The resulting average
   relative error of the hybrid algorithm was 2.36\%, while the
   conventional algorithm was 10.28\%. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Pervasive computing is one of the latest and more advanced paradigms
   currently available in the computers arena. Its ability to provide the
   distribution of computational services within environments where people
   live, work or socialize leads to make issues such as privacy, trust and
   identity more challenging compared to traditional computing
   environments. In this work, we review these general issues and propose a
   pervasive computing architecture based on a simple but effective trust
   model that is better able to cope with them. The proposed architecture
   combines some artificial intelligence techniques to achieve close
   resemblance with human-like decision making. Accordingly, Apriori
   algorithm is first used in order to extract the behavioral patterns
   adopted from the users during their network interactions. Na < ve Bayes
   classifier is then used for final decision making expressed in term of
   probability of user trustworthiness. To validate our approach, we
   applied it to some typical ubiquitous computing scenarios. The obtained
   results demonstrated the usefulness of such approach and the
   competitiveness against other existing ones.}},

Abstract = {{A Bayesian network (BN) is an important probabilistic model in the field
   of artificial intelligence and a powerful formalism used to describe
   uncertainty in the real world. As science and technology develop,
   considerable data on complex systems have been acquired by various
   means, which presents a significant challenge regarding how to
   accurately and robustly learn a network structure for a complex system.
   To address this challenge, many BN structure learning methods based on
   swarm intelligence have been developed. In this study, we perform a
   systematic comparison of three typical methods based on ant colony
   optimization, artificial bee colony algorithm, and bacterial foraging
   optimization. First, we analyze and summarize their main characteristics
   from the perspective of stochastic searching. Second, we conduct
   thorough experimental comparisons to examine the roles of different
   mechanisms in each method by means of multiaspect metrics, i.e., the K2
   score, structural differences, and execution time. Next, we perform
   further experiments to validate the robustness of different algorithms
   on some benchmark data sets with noise. Finally, we present the
   prospects and references for researchers who are engaged in learning BN

Title = {{Network-aware virtual machine migration in an overcommitted cloud}},
Journal = {{FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{428-442}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Virtualization, which acts as the underlying technology for cloud
   computing, enables large amounts of third-party applications to be
   packed into virtual machines (VMs). VM migration enables servers to be
   reconsolidated or reshuffled to reduce the operational costs of data
   centers. The network traffic costs for VM migration currently attract
   limited attention.
   However, traffic and bandwidth demands among VMs in a data center
   account for considerable total traffic. VM migration also causes
   additional data transfer overhead, which would also increase the network
   cost of the data center.
   This study considers a network-aware VM migration (NetVMM) problem in an
   overcommitted cloud and formulates it into a non-deterministic
   polynomial time-complete problem. This study aims to minimize network
   traffic costs by considering the inherent dependencies among VMs that
   comprise a multi-tier application and the underlying topology of
   physical machines and to ensure a good trade-off between network
   communication and VM migration costs.
   The mechanism that the swarm intelligence algorithm aims to find is an
   approximate optimal solution through repeated iterations to make it a
   good solution for the VM migration problem. In this study, genetic,
   algorithm (GA) and artificial bee colony (ABC) are adopted and changed
   to suit the VM migration problem to minimize the network cost.
   Experimental results show that GA has low network costs when VM
   instances are small. However, when the problem size increases, ABC is
   advantageous to GA. The running time of ABC is also nearly half than
   that of GA. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use ABC to
   solve the NetVMM problem. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Malicious attackers often scan nodes in a network in order to identify
   vulnerabilities that they may exploit as they traverse the network. In
   this paper, we propose that the system generates a mix of true and false
   answers in response to scan requests. If the attacker believes that all
   scan results are true, then he will be on a wrong path. If he believes
   some scan results are faked, he would have to expend time and effort in
   order to separate fact from fiction. We propose a probabilistic logic of
   deception and show that various computations are NP-hard. We model the
   attacker's state and show the effects of faked scan results. We then
   show how the defender can generate fake scan results in different states
   that minimize the damage the attacker can produce. We develop a
   Naive-PLD algorithm and a Fast-PLD heuristic algorithm for the defender
   to use and show experimentally that the latter performs well in a
   fraction of the run time of the former. We ran detailed experiments to
   assess the performance of these algorithms and further show that by
   running Fast-PLD off-line and storing the results, we can very
   efficiently answer run-time scan requests.}},

Abstract = {{(Context:) Cognitive diseases such as Alzheimers affect millions of
   people around the world. One common characteristic of such diseases is
   that the patient may assume irrational behaviors, which may result in
   damage to property or, much worse, in injury to family members or to the
   patient him/herself.
   (Objective:) These kinds of behaviors must be monitored via intelligent
   systems in order to guarantee the safety of the patients.
   (Problem:) They are characterized by their unpredictable and irrational
   nature which makes the development of monitoring software complex, this
   being the main challenge that must be faced.
   (Proposal:) In order to address this issue, our paper presents a
   structured approach to address the modeling and development of
   intelligent Ambient Assisted Living Systems for the monitoring of the
   behaviors of cognitively impaired people. The main impact of our
   contribution concerns both the automatic identification of irrational
   behaviors and a methodology for the design of safe AAL applications
   specifically targeted at users with cognitive or mental diseases. To
   prove the feasibility of our approach, we show a use case scenario in
   which we apply our solution to model a monitoring system able to
   recognize anomalous situations.
   (Results:) The preliminary results have shown that the application of
   the proposed process allows developers to improve the safety of the
   patient in a domestic environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{85}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{One of the most studied variant of portfolio optimization problems is
   with cardinality constraints that transform classical mean-variance
   model from a convex quadratic programming problem into a mixed integer
   quadratic programming problem which brings the problem to the class of
   NP-Complete problems. Therefore, the computational complexity is
   significantly increased since cardinality constraints have a direct
   influence on the portfolio size. In order to overcome arising
   computational difficulties, for solving this problem, researchers have
   focused on investigating efficient solution algorithms such as
   metaheuristic algorithms since exact techniques may be inadequate to
   find an optimal solution in a reasonable time and are computationally
   ineffective when applied to large-scale problems. In this paper, our
   purpose is to present an efficient solution approach based on an
   artificial bee colony algorithm with feasibility enforcement and
   infeasibility toleration procedures for solving cardinality constrained
   portfolio optimization problem. Computational results confirm the
   effectiveness of the solution methodology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{COGENT ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Large volumes of volunteered GPS traces in the last decade have provided
   location-based services with an opportunity to become more intelligent
   and personalized. Individual and group mobility patterns, detected from
   GPS traces, can be used for this purpose. In this paper, we show the
   potential of GPS traces, if managed properly in the database, for
   detecting points of interest for individual users and even recognizing
   individual users from their walking patterns. However, when it comes to
   GPS traces, databases can be very complicated and cumbersome to
   populate. Databases provided by OSM and GeoLife do not effectively pave
   the path for data mining and machine learning techniques which require a
   much more detailed and organized database. A GPS trace database must
   provide statistics and detailed information about GPS traces not only
   for visualization purposes at the front-end, but also for cross checking
   purposes to eliminate erroneous records and to be applied in mobility
   pattern detection applications. This study provides the design of an
   interactive database management system for GPS traces whose applications
   in detecting points of interest and user identification are tested with
   GPS traces from the GeoLife project. The results show that while the
   accuracy of detected points of interest depends mostly on the size of
   data, the accuracy of user identification relies more upon the
   appropriate choice of input features to machine learning techniques.}},

Abstract = {{With the exponential growth of network bandwidth and application
   requirements, the existing transmission control protocols have led to
   the issues of efficiency and applicability. In order to solve the
   network utility issues and accelerate the data delivery legitimately,
   the swift and self-learned transmission methods have attracted attention
   gradually due to its adaptability and predictability. In this research,
   we propose a high-speed transport protocol, called Hita, based on
   network performance learning framework to cope with high-speed transfer
   challenge over high bandwidth delay product networks. The key idea of
   Hita is to select preferable network performance metrics to reflect
   network property variability and build corresponding window control
   model. The proposed protocol, which adopts the online-learning methods,
   establishes the relation model between the transmission performance
   metrics and the corresponding congestion window. Afterwards, by
   determining the direction of window adjustment, the optimal sending
   window size can be predicted and approached quickly. Numerical results
   show that Hita can use the limited bandwidth more adequately. For
   simulation experiments, Hita achieves higher throughput while
   maintaining a lower packet delay comparing with other protocols.
   Moreover, Hita shows good performance in terms of intra-protocol
   fairness, friendliness and protocol stability. For real-world network
   experiments, Hita achieves more throughput than the other high-speed
   protocols as well.}},

Abstract = {{WiFi traffic offloading is becoming especially appealing because of the
   upcoming ultra-dense cellular networks. However, WiFi offloading
   decision as well as WiFi-Access Points (W-AP) selection should be
   carefully studied in order not to affect the offloaded users'
   experience. Here, a new reinforcement-learning framework is presented.
   The authors propose a distributed Q-learning algorithm in which each
   cellular user learns about his local environment and selects the best
   base station (macro-BS or W-AP) after reaching convergence. They
   introduce a new reward parameter which takes into account the load of
   each detected W-AP, the duration of the vertical handover, the offered
   gain, as well as the achieved signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio.
   With the Q-learning scheme, each user decides to join the WiFi
   offloading or not, depending on the received reward from his environment
   and from his previous learning. In addition, since the AP's load value
   is very important in the reward parameter, an optimal value of the
   weight given to the channel load is solved under quality of service
   constraint. Simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed
   Q-learning-based scheme when compared with common WiFi offloading scheme

Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{This research paper presents an advanced approach to enhance the
   short-term wind power prediction based on artificial intelligence
   techniques (AI). A high-quality wind power prediction is essential for
   power system planning, operation and control. Thus, a new novel approach
   has been developed to improve the quality and reliability of the
   calculated results by integrating advanced time series processing method
   and the extreme learning machine technique (ELM). Moreover, historical
   records are utilised from numerical weather information and multiple
   observations points close to real wind farm sites within Australia
   regions. The wind speed is assessed by using the developed model in the
   first stage, and then the wind power, and capacity factor is calculated
   using wind power-speed curve (PC) for each observation site. Artificial
   neural network (ANN), Fuzzy logic (ANFIS), and support vector machines
   (SVM) models are used for model verifications, validations, and
   practical applications. The developed model is tested using real wind
   measurements by Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) 15 selected weather stations
   corresponded to the locations of nearby real wind farm sites in
   Australia. The demonstrated results and performance indicators, e.g.
   root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are compared
   to Khalid, Persistence and Grey predictor models for validations and
   verifications reasons. As the potential gains over other techniques, the
   proposed model has found more efficient and superior for wind power
   estimation, and prediction than others developed conventional methods
   and models, which in turns improves the power system performance, and
   reduces the economic impacts.}},

Title = {{A loss function based parameterless learning automaton scheme}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{260}},
Pages = {{331-340}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Learning automaton (LA) is a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in
   the field of Artificial Intelligence. In the evaluation of LA, it has
   always been a key issue how to trade off between ``accuracy{''} and
   ``speed{''}, which substantially involves in parameter tuning. Owing to
   the environmental randomness and complexity, it universally takes
   millions of interactions during the process of parameter tuning,
   bringing about a tremendous expense. To avoid this fatal flaw, in this
   paper, a novel parameterless learning automaton named LFPLA is proposed.
   It shows an intriguing property of not relying on manually configured
   parameters and possesses an epsilon-optimality property in any
   stationary random environment. A distinctive innovation lies in a newly
   defined loss function, which replaces the probability vector maintaining
   in conventional LA. Furthermore, a series of sampling strategies are
   designed for action selection, and in terms of iteration termination
   conditions, a sufficiently small threshold is employed. In addition to
   proving its advantageous performance theoretically by detailed
   mathematical proofs, we also carried out extensive experiments to
   illustrate the effectiveness in two-action as well as multi-action
   benchmark environments, by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The
   proposed LFPLA converges faster with a higher accuracy than the only
   parameter-free LA presently: GBLA. Moreover, it is superior to the state
   of the arts in multi action LA, especially in complex and confuse
   environments. Most of all, it embodies a unique and extraordinary
   benefit with special regard to either tuning cost or interaction cost.

Abstract = {{We propose and validate a complex-valued multilevel artificial neural
   network nonlinear equalizer (ANN-NLE) for single-carrier 16QAM and 64QAM
   signals transmissions in the 60-GHz radio-over-fiber (RoF) transmission
   system. First, we analyze the nonlinearities in the fiber-wireless
   channels. Then, we introduce the principles of the multilevel ANN-NLE
   proposed for the millimeter-wave RoF systems. From the analysis of
   nonlinearities in a single-carrier optical transmission channel, it is
   essential to design a complex-valued ANN-NLE to mitigate the
   cross-modulation (XM) effects between the in-phase (I) and
   quadrature-phase (Q) components. Finally, we report on single-carrier
   signaling at 16QAM and 64QAM on 60 GHz, demonstrating the ability of the
   proposed ANN-NLE approach to minimize the nonlinear compression in an
   RoF system. As an added benefit, the complex-valued ANN-NLE has a great
   tolerance to phase rotations. The convergence time, activation function,
   step size, and number of taps are discussed in Section IV.}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Dragonfly algorithm (DA) is a recently proposed optimization algorithm
   based on the static and dynamic swarming behaviour of dragonflies. Due
   to its simplicity and efficiency, DA has received interest of
   researchers from different fields. However, it lacks internal memory
   which may lead to its premature convergence to local optima. To overcome
   this drawback, we propose a novel Memory based Hybrid Dragonfly
   Algorithm (MHDA) for solving numerical optimization problems. The pbest
   and gbest concept of Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) is added to
   conventional DA to guide the search process for potential candidate
   solutions and PSO is then initialized with pbest of DA to further
   exploit the search space. The proposed method combines the exploration
   capability of DA and exploitation capability of PSO to achieve global
   optimal solutions. The efficiency of the MHDA is validated by testing on
   basic unconstrained benchmark functions and CEC 2014 test functions. A
   comparative performance analysis between MHDA and other powerful
   optimization algorithms have been carried out and significance of the
   results is proved by statistical methods. The results show that MHDA
   gives better performance than conventional DA and PSO. Moreover, it
   gives competitive results in terms of convergence, accuracy and
   search-ability when compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The
   efficacy of MHDA in solving real world problems is also explained with
   three engineering design problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{114-121}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Joint inference is a fundamental issue in the field of artificial
   intelligence. The greatest advantage of the joint inference is
   demonstrated by its capability of avoiding errors from cascading and
   accumulating on a pipeline of multiple chained sub-tasks. Markov Logic
   Network(MLN) is the most common joint inference model that provides a
   flexible representation and handles uncertainty. It has been applied
   successfully to joint inference on many natural language processing
   tasks to avoid error propagation. However, due to the great
   expressiveness of first-order logic, the representation for it in MLN
   generates rather complicated graph structures, which makes the learning
   and inference on large scale data intractably. In this paper, we present
   an ensemble learning approach to deal with the challenges in MLNs.
   Firstly, we give a proof within the probably approximately correct (PAC)
   framework. The proof points out what conditions are necessary for
   successful applying the ensemble learning approach to MLN. Secondly, the
   paper explains how to combine the learners. Finally, in order to
   illustrate the working mechanism of the ensemble joint inference model,
   we present an Ensemble Markov Logic Networks (EMLNs) method and use it
   to extract knowledge from a large scale corpus published by Google.1
   Experiments suggest that significant speedup can be gained by the EMLNs.
   Meanwhile, it show that this approach leads to a higher precision and
   recall than that of those pipeline approaches. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Machine learning models and bankruptcy prediction}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{405-417}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{There has been intensive research from academics and practitioners
   regarding models for predicting bankruptcy and default events, for
   credit risk management. Seminal academic research has evaluated
   bankruptcy using traditional statistics techniques (e.g. discriminant
   analysis and logistic regression) and early artificial intelligence
   models (e.g. artificial neural networks). In this study, we test machine
   learning models (support vector machines, bagging, boosting, and random
   forest) to predict bankruptcy one year prior to the event, and compare
   their performance with results from discriminant analysis, logistic
   regression, and neural networks. We use data from 1985 to 2013 on North
   American firms, integrating information from the Salomon Center database
   and Compustat, analysing more than 10,000 firm-year observations. The
   key insight of the study is a substantial improvement in prediction
   accuracy using machine learning techniques especially when, in addition
   to the original Altman's Z-score variables, we include six complementary
   financial indicators. Based on Carton and Hofer (2006), we use new
   variables, such as the operating margin, change in return-on-equity,
   change in price-to-book, and growth measures related to assets, sales,
   and number of employees, as predictive variables. Machine learning
   models show, on average, approximately 10\% more accuracy in relation to
   traditional models. Comparing the best models, with all predictive
   variables, the machine learning technique related to random forest led
   to 87\% accuracy, whereas logistic regression and linear discriminant
   analysis led to 69\% and 50\% accuracy, respectively, in the testing
   sample. We find that bagging, boosting, and random forest models
   outperform the others techniques, and that all prediction accuracy in
   the testing sample improves when the additional variables are included.
   Our research adds to the discussion of the continuing debate about
   superiority of computational methods over statistical techniques such as
   in Tsai, Hsu, and Yen (2014) and Yeh, Chi, and Lin (2014). In
   particular, for machine learning mechanisms, we do not find SVM to lead
   to higher accuracy rates than other models. This result contradicts
   outcomes from Danenas and Garsva (2015) and Cleofas-Sanchez, Garcia,
   Marques, and Senchez (2016), but corroborates, for instance, Wang, Ma,
   and Yang (2014), Liang, Lu, Tsai, and Shih (2016), and Cano et al.
   (2017). Our study supports the applicability of the expert systems by
   practitioners as in Heo and Yang (2014), Kim, Kang, and Kim (2015) and
   Xiao, Xiao, and Wang (2016). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   significant improvement is likely in predicting downstream flows by

Abstract = {{The satisfiability problem is always a core problem in artificial
   intelligence (AI). And how to improve the efficiency of algorithms
   solving the satisfiability problem is widely concerned. Algorithm IER
   (Improved Extension Rule) is based on extension rule. The number of
   atoms and the number of clauses affect the efficiency of the algorithm
   IER. DPLL rules are helpful to reduce these numbers. Then a complete
   algorithm CIER based on splitting rule and extension rule is proposed in
   this paper in order to improve the efficiency. At first, the algorithm
   CIER (Complete Improved Extension Rule) reduces the scale of a clause
   set with DPLL rules. Then, the clause set is split into a group of small
   clause sets. In the end, the satisfiability of the clause set is got
   from these small clause sets'. A strategy MOAMD (maximum occurrences and
   maximum difference) for the algorithm CIER is given. With this strategy,
   a better arrangement of atoms could be got. This arrangement could make
   the number of small clause sets fewer and the scale of these sets
   smaller. So, the algorithm CIER will be more efficient.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Traffic congestion has become a vexing and complex issue in many urban
   areas. Of particular interest are the intersections where traffic
   bottlenecks are known to occur despite being traditionally signalized.
   Reinforcement learning (RL), which is an artificial intelligence
   approach, has been adopted in traffic signal control for monitoring and
   ameliorating traffic congestion. RL enables autonomous decision makers
   (e.g., traffic signal controllers) to observe, learn, and select the
   optimal action (e.g., determining the appropriate traffic phase and its
   timing) to manage traffic such that system performance is improved. This
   article reviews various RL models and algorithms applied to traffic
   signal control in the aspects of the representations of the RL model
   (i.e., state, action, and reward), performance measures, and complexity
   to establish a foundation for further investigation in this research
   field. Open issues are presented toward the end of this article to
   discover new research areas with the objective to spark new interest in

Abstract = {{Machine translation is an active research domain in fields of artificial
   intelligence. The relevant literature presents a number of machine
   translation approaches for the translation of different languages. Urdu
   is the national language of Pakistan while Arabic is a major language in
   almost 20 different countries of the world comprising almost 450 million
   people. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published research
   work presenting any method on machine translation from Urdu to Arabic,
   however, some online machine translation systems like Google(1), Bing(2)
   and Babylon(3) provide Urdu to Arabic machine translation facility. In
   this paper, we compare the performance of online machine translation
   systems. The input in Urdu language is translated by the systems and the
   output in Arabic is compared with the ground truth data of Arabic
   reference sentences. The comparative analysis evaluates the systems by
   three performance evaluation measures: BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation
   Understudy), METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit
   ORdering) and NIST (National Institute of Standard and Technology) with
   the help of a standard corpus. The results show that Google translator
   is far better than Bing and Babylon translators. It outperforms, on the
   average, Babylon by 28.55\% and Bing by 15.74\%.}},

Abstract = {{The recently introduced theory of practopoiesis offers an account on how
   adaptive intelligent systems are organized. According to that theory,
   biological agents adapt at three levels of organization and this
   structure applies also to our brains. This is referred to as
   tri-traversal theory of the organization of mind or for short, a
   T3-structure. To implement a similar T3-organization in an artificially
   intelligent agent, it is necessary to have multiple policies, as usually
   used as a concept in the theory of reinforcement learning. These
   policies have to form a hierarchy. We define adaptive practopoietic
   systems in terms of hierarchy of policies and calculate whether the
   total variety of behavior required by real-life conditions of an adult
   human can be satisfactorily accounted for by a traditional approach to
   artificial intelligence based on T2-agents, or whether a T3-agent is
   needed instead. We conclude that the complexity of real life can be
   dealt with appropriately only by a T3-agent. This means that the current
   approaches to artificial intelligence, such as deep architectures of
   neural networks, will not suffice with fixed network architectures.
   Rather, they will need to be equipped with intelligent mechanisms that
   rapidly alter the architectures of those networks.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we discuss an innovative media entertainment
   application called Interactive Movietelling. As an offspring of
   Interactive Storytelling applied to movies, we propose to integrate
   narrative generation through artificial intelligence (AI) planning with
   video processing and modeling to construct filmic variants starting from
   the baseline content. The integration is possible thanks to content
   description using semantic attributes pertaining to intermediate-level
   concepts shared between video processing and planning levels. The output
   is a recombination of segments taken from the input movie performed so
   as to convey an alternative plot. User tests on the prototype proved how
   promising Interactive Movietelling might be, even if it was designed at
   a proof of concept level. Possible improvements that are suggested here
   lead to many challenging research issues.}},

Abstract = {{Bionic intelligence algorithms have many advantages compared with

   growth law of trees, a new bionic algorithm, named artificial tree (AT)

   solution, and the branch thickness is the indicator of the solution. The
   computing process of AT is achieved by simulating the transport of
   organic matters and the update of tree branches. The comparative
   analysis using thirty typical benchmark problems between AT algorithm

Title = {{A graph-based semantic relatedness assessment method combining wikipedia

Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{268-281}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Semantic relatedness assessment between concepts is a critical issue in
   many domains such as artificial intelligence, information retrieval,
   psychology, biology, linguistics and cognitive science. Therefore,
   several methods assess relatedness by exploiting knowledge bases to
   express the semantics of concepts. However, there are some limitations
   such as high-dimensional space, high-computational complexity, fitting
   non-dynamic domains. Considering that Wikipedia, a domain-independent
   encyclopedic repository, which provides very large coverage, has been
   exploited by many methods as a huge semantic resource. In this paper, we
   propose a novel graph-based relatedness assessment method using
   Wikipedia features to avoid some of the limitations and drawbacks
   mentioned above. Firstly, for each term in a word pair, the top k most
   relevant Wikipedia concepts are returned by the Naive-ESA algorithm to
   reduce the dimensional space of Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) method.
   Secondly, for each different candidate concept in two relevant concept
   sets, we collect its categories set from the Wikipedia Category Graph
   (WCG). Based on the categories in WCG network, the relatedness between
   concepts at the correspondence position of the two sorted concept sets
   is computed as the association coefficient. Thirdly, based on this
   parameter, a novel relatedness assessment metric is presented. The
   evaluation is performed on some datasets well-recognized as benchmarks,
   using several widely used metrics and a new metric designed by
   ourselves. The result demonstrates that our method has a better
   correlation with the intuitions of human judgments than other related
   works. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Corrosion is a common deterioration that reduces the service life of
   concrete structures and steels. Particularly, corrosion behavior is a
   highly nonlinear problem influenced by complex characteristics. This
   study used advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict
   pitting corrosion risk of steel reinforced concrete and marine corrosion
   rate of carbon steel. The AI-based models used for prediction included
   single and ensemble models constructed from four well-known machine
   learners including artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector
   regression/machines (SVR/SVMs), classification and regression tree
   (CART), and linear regression (LR). Notably, a hybrid metaheuristic
   regression model was implemented by integrating a smart nature-inspired
   metaheuristic optimization algorithm (i.e., smart firefly algorithm)
   with a least squares SVR. Prediction accuracy was evaluated using two
   real-world datasets. According to the comparison results, the hybrid
   metaheuristic regression model was better than the single and ensemble
   models in predicting the pitting corrosion risk (mean absolute
   percentage error = 5.6\%) and the marine corrosion rate (mean absolute
   percentage error = 1.26\%). The hybrid metaheuristic regression model is
   a promising and practical methodology for real-time tracking of
   corrosion in steel rebar. Civil engineers can use the hybrid model to
   schedule maintenance process that leads to risk reduction of structure
   failure and maintenance cost. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Spectrum sensing is a significant issue in cognitive radio networks
   which enables estimation of the frequency spectrum and hence provides
   frequency reuse. In the large-scale cognitive radio networks, secondary
   users cannot share a common spectrum since the coverage area of primary
   users is limited. In this study, the authors suggest a diffusion
   adaptive learning algorithm based on correntropy cooperation policy,
   which first categorises received data of secondary users into several
   groups, and then learns a common spectrum inside each group. The
   mean-square performance of proposed algorithm is analysed and supported
   by simulations. Experimental results show that, in a multitask cognitive
   network, the proposed algorithm can achieve a better mean-square
   deviation learning performance both in transient and steady-state

   emitting laser (VCSEL) is a popular, mature, and cost-effective photonic
   transmitter technology that enables energy proportionality by allowing
   the links' data rate and the associated power consumption to be
   adjusted. Our work assumes VCSEL-based optical interconnects and
   presents intelligent centralized and distributed mechanisms to jointly
   and optimally select the routes, the flow sizes, and the transmission
   powers needed to serve a given input traffic load, minimize the consumed
   energy, and optimize performance. For this purpose, we use a detailed
   VCSEL energy model and formulate the energy minimization problem as a
   constrained nonlinear multicommodity optimization problem, which is
   solved optimally with the proposed approaches. The simulation results,
   carried out under a variety of scenarios, show the efficiency of these
   methods in terms of throughput and energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Communities in social networks are groups of individuals who are
   connected with specific goals. Discovering information on the structure,
   members and types of changes of communities have always been of great
   interest. Despite the extensive global researches conducted on these,
   discovery has not been confirmed yet and researchers try to find methods
   and improve estimated techniques by using Data Mining tools, Graph
   Mining tools and artificial intelligence techniques. This paper proposes
   a novel two-phase approach based on global and local information to
   detect communities in social network. It explores the global information
   in the first phase and then exploits the local information in the second
   phase to discover communities more accurately. It also proposes a novel
   algorithm which exploits the local information and mines deeply for the
   second phase. Experimental results show that the proposed method has
   better performance and achieves more accurate results compared with the
   previous ones.}},

Title = {{Hyper-Learning Algorithms for Online Evolution of Robot Controllers}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUTONOMOUS AND ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A long-standing goal in artificial intelligence and robotics is
   synthesising agents that can effectively learn and adapt throughout
   their lifetime. One open-ended approach to behaviour learning in
   autonomous robots is online evolution, which is part of the evolutionary
   robotics field of research. In online evolution approaches, an
   evolutionary algorithm is executed on the robots during task execution,
   which enables continuous optimisation and adaptation of behaviour.
   Despite the potential for automatic behaviour learning, online evolution
   has not been widely adopted because it often requires several hours or
   days to synthesise solutions to a given task. In this respect, research
   in the field has failed to develop a prevalent algorithm able to
   effectively synthesise solutions to a large number of different tasks in
   a timely manner. Rather than focusing on a single algorithm, we argue
   for more general mechanisms that can combine the benefits of different
   algorithms to increase the performance of online evolution of robot
   controllers. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of a novel approach
   called online hyper-evolution (OHE). Robots executing OHE use the
   different sources of feedback information traditionally associated with
   controller evaluation to find effective evolutionary algorithms during
   task execution. First, we study two approaches: OHE-fitness, which uses
   the fitness score of controllers as the criterion to select promising
   algorithms over time, and OHE-diversity, which relies on the behavioural
   diversity of controllers for algorithm selection. We then propose a
   novel class of techniques called OHE-hybrid, which combine diversity and
   fitness to search for suitable algorithms. In addition to their
   effectiveness at selecting suitable algorithms, the different OHE
   approaches are evaluated for their ability to construct algorithms by
   controlling which algorithmic components should be employed for
   controller generation (e.g., mutation, crossover, among others), an
   unprecedented approach in evolutionary robotics. Results show that OHE
   (i) facilitates the evolution of controllers with high performance, (ii)
   can increase effectiveness at different stages of evolution by combining
   the benefits of multiple algorithms over time, and (iii) can be
   effectively applied to construct new algorithms during task execution.
   Overall, our study shows that OHE is a powerful new paradigm that allows
   robots to improve their learning process as they operate in the task
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The evaluation of artificial intelligence systems and components is
   crucial for the progress of the discipline. In this paper we describe
   and critically assess the different ways AI systems are evaluated, and
   the role of components and techniques in these systems. We first focus
   on the traditional task-oriented evaluation approach. We identify three
   kinds of evaluation: human discrimination, problem benchmarks and peer
   confrontation. We describe some of the limitations of the many
   evaluation schemes and competitions in these three categories, and
   follow the progression of some of these tests. We then focus on a less
   customary (and challenging) ability-oriented evaluation approach, where
   a system is characterised by its (cognitive) abilities, rather than by
   the tasks it is designed to solve. We discuss several possibilities: the
   adaptation of cognitive tests used for humans and animals, the
   development of tests derived from algorithmic information theory or more
   integrated approaches under the perspective of universal psychometrics.
   We analyse some evaluation tests from AI that are better positioned for
   an ability-oriented evaluation and discuss how their problems and
   limitations can possibly be addressed with some of the tools and ideas
   that appear within the paper. Finally, we enumerate a series of lessons
   learnt and generic guidelines to be used when an AI evaluation scheme is
   under consideration.}},

Abstract = {{U-type assembly lines are extensively applied in modern manufacturing
   systems for higher flexibility and productivity. This research presents
   a new mixed-integer linear programming model to minimize the number of
   stations, where one expression is used to represent the precedence
   relationship constraint rather than two expressions as in published
   researches. The proposed model is compared to three other models and the
   correctness or the incorrectness of these models are analyzed by
   enumerating all possible allocations between the two tasks. The
   comparison makes it clear that the proposed model iterates fast and
   achieves competing results. Additionally, a modified ant colony
   optimization approach, referred to as station-oriented ant colony
   optimization algorithm, is proposed to tackle large-size problems. This
   method generates a set of task assignments and selects the best one for
   the current station, rather than obtaining only one task assignment at a
   time. A set of benchmark problems is solved using the proposed method
   and the results are compared to those obtained by the state-of-the-art
   methods (including ULINO) and the variants of ant colony optimization
   approach. The computational study demonstrates the superiority of the
   proposed method over the compared ones as it achieves optimal solutions
   for 255 cases (out of 269) and outperforms the current best method,
   ULINO, for 21 cases. It is also worthy to mention that the
   station-oriented procedure improves the performance of original ant
   colony optimization by a significant margin. (C) 2017 Published by

Abstract = {{Fuel cost and CO2 emissions in operating ships are major challenges for
   the maritime industry. A large marine transport company spends more than
   2.6 billion U.S. dollars on fuel every year. In order to reduce fuel
   consumption as well as CO2 emissions from ships, it is crucial to be
   able to accurately calculate the impact of winds and waves on ship speed
   and fuel efficiency. Normally, existing ship performance estimation
   technologies rely on experiments with model ships in tanks of water, or
   on physics model simulations. However, they do not take into account the
   complicated interactions of winds, waves, and sea currents that
   influence the state of ships at real sea waters, resulting in large
   margins of error. Against this background, Fujitsu Laboratories has
   developed a technology to visualize ship performance. In addition to
   weather and sea conditions including winds, waves, and sea currents
   during actual ship operation, it collects engine log data and ship
   operation data such as location and ship speed, and posts it to the
   cloud, and then analyzes these data using high-dimensional statistical
   analysis that we developed. Applying this technology to a
   university-owned test ship and some merchant ships resulted in highly
   accurate estimation of ship speed and fuel consumption for each of the
   ships, with error of 5\% or less. We also evaluated this technology
   through simulation and verified that it can improve fuel efficiency
   significantly. This paper describes this technology to predict ship
   performance in real sea waters, which is key to reducing ship fuel
   consumption, with some examples of system configurations.}},

Abstract = {{5G cellular networks are assumed to be the key enabler and
   infrastructure provider in the ICT industry, by offering a variety of
   services with diverse requirements. The standardization of 5G cellular
   networks is being expedited, which also implies more of the candidate
   technologies will be adopted. Therefore, it is worthwhile to provide
   insight into the candidate techniques as a whole and examine the design
   philosophy behind them. In this article, we try to highlight one of the
   most fundamental features among the revolutionary techniques in the 5G
   era, i.e., there emerges initial intelligence in nearly every important
   aspect of cellular networks, including radio resource management,
   mobility management, service provisioning management, and so on.
   However, faced with ever-increasingly complicated configuration issues
   and blossoming new service requirements, it is still insufficient for 5G
   cellular networks if it lacks complete AI functionalities. Hence, we
   further introduce fundamental concepts in AI and discuss the
   relationship between AI and the candidate techniques in 5G cellular
   networks. Specifically, we highlight the opportunities and challenges to
   exploit AI to achieve intelligent 5G networks, and demonstrate the
   effectiveness of AI to manage and orchestrate cellular network
   resources. We envision that AI-empowered 5G cellular networks will make

Abstract = {{The use of welded lightweight steels in structural applications is
   increasing due to the greater design possibilities offered by such
   materials and the lower costs compared to conventional steels.
   Ultra-high-strength steels (UHSS) having tensile strength of up to 1700
   MPa with a high strength-to-weight ratio offer a unique combination of
   qualities for diverse industrial applications. For productivity and
   quality reasons, gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is usually utilized for
   welding of UHSS. However, for full penetration fillet welded joints, the
   need for high heat input to gain acceptable weld penetration is
   problematic when welding UHSS. This is due to UHSS sensitivity to heat
   input and possible heat-affected zone (HAZ) softening. In this paper, an
   attempt is made, on the basis of analysis of experimental reviews, to
   identify and define relationships between nonlinear weldability factors
   to enable creation of an artificial intelligence model to predict full
   penetration in robotic GMAW fillet welded joints of UHSS S960QC. Welding
   variables and parameters associated with GMAW are first evaluated by
   reviewing scientific literature. The possibility of employing an
   artificial neural network (ANN) to predict full penetration fillet weld
   characteristics is then examined. It is noted that nonlinear variables
   associated with the GMAW process, such as heat input, contact tip to
   work distance (CTWD), and torch angle, and their related parameters,
   which pose weldability challenges, can be modeled by applying artificial
   intelligence systems. Ensuring full penetration in fillet welded joints
   of UHSS using artificial intelligence is thus feasible. Further, an
   optimized control system could potentially be developed by incorporating
   adaptive robotic GMAW with an artificial intelligence-based system to
   guarantee sound structural integrity that conforms to EN ISO 5817. The
   paper increases awareness of welding aspects of UHSS S960QC and presents
   an approach for overcoming existing limits to GMAW via adaptive robotic
   welding and artificial intelligence systems.}},

Abstract = {{Personality prediction based on textual data is one topic gaining
   attention recently for its potential in large-scale personalized
   applications such as social media-based marketing. However, when
   applying this technology in real-world applications, users often
   encounter situations in which the personality traits derived from
   different sources (e.g., social media posts versus emails) are
   inconsistent. Varying results for the same individual renders the
   technology ineffective and untrustworthy. In this paper, we demonstrate
   the impact of domain differences in automated text-based personality
   prediction. We also propose different approaches for domain error
   correction to meet different needs: (a) single or multi-domain
   correction and (b) outcome-based or input feature-based error
   correction. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the
   effectiveness of these methods. Our findings demonstrate a significant
   improvement of prediction accuracy with the proposed methods. (e.g.,
   20-30\% relative error reduction using outcome-based error correction or
   48\% increase of F1 score using feature-based error correction).}},

Abstract = {{Many Artificial Intelligence techniques have been developed for
   intelligent and autonomous systems to act and make rational decisions
   based on perceptions of the world state. Among these techniques, HTN
   (Hierarchical Task Network) planning is one of the most used in
   practice. HTN planning is based on expressive languages allowing to
   specify complex expert knowledge for real world domains. At the same
   time, many preprocessing techniques for classical planning were proposed
   to speed up the search. One of these technique, named grounding,
   consists in enumerating and instantiating all the possible actions from
   the planning problem descriptions. This technique has proven its
   effectiveness. Therefore, combining the expressiveness of HTN planning
   with the efficiency of the grounding preprocessing techniques used in
   classical planning is a very challenging issue. In this paper, we
   propose a generic algorithm to ground the domain representation for HTN
   planning. We show experimentally that grounding process improves the
   performances of state of the art HTN planners on a range of planning
   problems from the International Planning Competition (IPC).}},

Abstract = {{Deep neural networks (DNNs) are complex computational models that have
   found great success in many artificial intelligence applications, such
   as computer vision1,2 and natural language processing.3,4 In the past
   four years, DNNs have also generated promising results for quantitative
   structure-activity relationship (QSAR) tasks.5,6 Previous work showed
   that DNNs can routinely make better predictions than traditional
   methods, such as random forests, on a diverse collection of QSAR data
   sets. It was also found that multitask DNN models-those trained on and
   predicting multiple QSAR properties simultaneously-outperform DNNs
   trained separately on the individual data sets in many, but not all,
   tasks. To date there has been no satisfactory explanation of why the
   QSAR of one task embedded in a multitask DNN can borrow information from
   other unrelated QSAR tasks. Thus, using multitask DNNs in a way that
   consistently provides a predictive advantage becomes a challenge. In
   this work, we explored why multitask DNNs make a difference in
   predictive performance. Our results show that during prediction a
   multitask DNN does borrow signal from molecules with similar structures
   in the training sets of the other tasks. However, whether this borrowing
   leads to better or worse predictive performance depends on whether the
   activities are correlated. On the basis of this, we have developed a
   strategy to use multitask DNNs that incorporate prior domain knowledge
   to select training sets with correlated activities, and we demonstrate
   its effectiveness on several examples.}},

Abstract = {{The energy demand estimation commands great importance for both
   developing and developed countries in terms of the economy and country
   resources. In this study, the differential evolution algorithm ( DE) was
   used to forecast the long-term energy demand in Turkey. In addition to
   being employed for solving regular optimization problems, DE is also a
   global, meta-heuristic algorithm that enables fast, reliable and
   operative stochastic searches based on population. Considering the
   correlation between the increase in certain economic indicators in
   Turkey and the increase of energy consumption, two equations were
   used-one applying the linear form and the other the quadratic form.
   Turkey's long-term energy demand from 2012 to 2031 was estimated through
   the DE method in three different scenarios and in terms of the gross
   domestic product, import, export and population. To prove the success of
   the DE method in addressing the energy demand problem, the DE method was
   compared to other methods found in the literature. Results showed that
   the proposed DE method was more successful than the other methods.
   Furthermore, the future projections of energy demand obtained using the
   proposed method were compared to the indicators of energy demand
   estimated and observed by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.}},

   under its respective worst-case scenario. A novel artificial bee colony
   algorithm was developed and verified by experimental results. The

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors propose a novel approach for single image
   super-resolution. Their method is based on the idea of learning a
   mapping function, which can reveal the intrinsic relationship between
   sparse coefficients of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR)
   image patch pairs with respect to their individual dictionaries.
   Adaptive regularised l(2)-boosting algorithm is proposed to learn this
   type of mapping function. Specifically, to reduce time consumption, the
   authors cluster training patches into several clusters. Within each
   cluster, a pair of dictionaries for LR and HR image patches is jointly
   trained. Adaptive regularised l(2)-boosting algorithm is then employed
   to obtain the function. Thus, in a reconstruction stage, for each given
   input LR image patch, the authors can effectively estimate its
   corresponding HR image patch. Their extensive experimental results
   demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a performance of similar
   quality performance to that of the top methods.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-label image classification has attracted considerable attention in
   machine learning recently. Active learning is widely used in multi-label
   learning because it can effectively reduce the human annotation workload
   required to construct high-performance classifiers. However, annotation
   by experts is costly, especially when the number of labels in a dataset
   is large. Inspired by the idea of semi-supervised learning, in this
   study, the authors propose a novel, semi-supervised multi-label active
   learning (SSMAL) method that combines automated annotation with human
   annotation to reduce the annotation workload associated with the active
   learning process. In SSMAL, they capture three aspects of potentially
   useful information - classification prediction information, label
   correlation information, and example spatial information - and they use
   this information to develop an effective strategy for automated
   annotation of selected unlabelled example-label pairs. The experimental
   results obtained in this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   authors' proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Object representations are of great importance for robust visual
   tracking. Although the high-dimensional representation can effectively
   encode the input data with more information, exploiting it in a
   real-time tracking system would be intractable and infeasible due to the
   high computational cost and memory requirements. In this study, the
   authors propose a compact discriminative object representation to
   achieve both good tracking accuracy and efficiency. An ensemble of weak
   training sets is generated based on the self-representative ability of
   tracking samples, which is applied to learn discriminative functions.
   Each candidate is represented by the concatenation of project values on
   all the weak training sets. Tracking is then carried out within a
   Bayesian inference framework where the classification score of the
   support vector machine is used to construct the observation model. The
   evaluations on TB50 benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed
   algorithm is much more computationally efficient than the
   state-of-the-art methods with comparable accuracy.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5, SI}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of terminologies used in primary care causes significant
   challenges regarding semantic interoperability. Attempts to address
   these challenges usually focus on the creation of metaterminologies,
   with the peculiarities of national variations of terminologies being
   overlooked. In this study the extent to which primary care data can be
   meaningfully exchanged between nationally implemented terminologies is
   assessed using a rule-based approach. To determine this, a model
   comprising primary care terminologies and including axioms to define
   their relations was developed. Generic metrics were designed to
   determine the completeness and accuracy of any two arbitrary
   vocabularies within an ontological model. These metrics were used on an
   implementation of the model to determine the data quality that is
   preserved when expressing similar data in different primary care
   terminologies. The results show that values of terminologies which are
   closely related can express each other's concepts relatively well. The
   authors conclude that the current state of accuracy and completeness
   between primary care terminologies does not allow for sufficiently
   meaningful semantic interoperability, but that their approach of mapping
   lower-level terminologies to each other next to an ontological approach
   may yield better results than relying solely on the latter.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The testing of configurations with constraints still faces a great
   challenge. Although artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms
   perform better than greedy algorithms on t-way testing because of the
   good searching ability of optimal solutions, only a few AI-based
   algorithms can support constraints currently. Moreover, the AI-based
   algorithms can only ignore the conflicting candidate test cases subject
   to constraints, even though they are optimal. In this paper, we
   demonstrate two novel particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based constraint
   test cases generation (PCTG) methods. In the two methods, the strategies
   of avoiding the selection of conflicting test cases and replacing
   conflicting test cases are applied to handle constraints, respectively.
   They guide the process of searching for optimal solutions from different
   perspectives, according to different handling of constraints. We
   evaluate the availability of these two methods with some excellent
   existing strategies in terms of performance. The evaluation results
   indicate that our proposed methods, in most cases, outperform other
   strategies as far as the generated constraints covering array sizes.}},

Abstract = {{The journal Knowledge-based Systems (KnoSys) has been published for over
   25 years, during which time its main foci have been extended to a broad
   range of studies in computer science and artificial intelligence.
   Answering the questions: ``What is the KnoSys community interested
   in?{''} and ``How does such interest change over time?{''} are important
   to both the editorial board and audience of KnoSys. This paper conducts
   a topic-based bibliometric study to detect and predict the topic changes
   of KnoSys from 1991 to 2016. A Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is used
   to profile the hotspots of KnoSys and predict possible future trends
   from a probabilistic perspective. A model of scientific evolutionary
   pathways applies a learning-based process to detect the topic changes of
   KnoSys in sequential time slices. Six main research areas of KnoSys are
   identified, i.e., expert systems, machine learning, data mining,
   decision making, optimization, and fuzzy, and the results also indicate
   that the interest of KnoSys communities in the area of computational
   intelligence is raised, and the ability to construct practical systems
   through knowledge use and accurate prediction models is highly
   emphasized. Such empirical insights can be used as a guide for KnoSys

   using randomly generated and chaotic system, and then in the second
   phase to balance two antagonist factors, i.e., exploration and
   exploitation capabilities, population is portioned into two groups

   the first group, whereas SFLA is applied to the second group of
   population. The proposed version is named as Shuffled-ABC. The proposal

Abstract = {{This work describes how genetic programming is applied to evolving
   controllers for the minimum time swing up and inverted balance tasks of
   the continuous state and action: limited torque acrobot. The best
   swing-up controller is able to swing the acrobot up to a position very
   close to the inverted handstand' position in a very short time, shorter
   than that of Coulom (2004), who applied the same constraints on the
   applied torque values, and to take only slightly longer than the
   approach by Lai et al. (2009) where far larger torque values were
   allowed. The best balance controller is able to balance the acrobot in
   the inverted position when starting from the balance position for the
   length of time used in the fitness function in all runs; furthermore, 47
   out of 50 of the runs evolve controllers able to maintain the balance
   position for an extended period, an improvement on the balance
   controllers generated by Dracopoulos and Nichols (2012), which this
   paper is extended from. The most successful balance controller is also
   able to balance the acrobot when starting from a small offset from the
   balance position for this extended period.}},

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Large service companies run complex customer service processes to
   provide communication services to their customers. The flawless
   execution of these processes is essential because customer service is an
   important differentiator. They must also be able to predict if processes
   will complete successfully or run into exceptions in order to intervene
   at the right time, preempt problems and maintain customer service.
   Business process data are sequential in nature and can be very diverse.
   Thus, there is a need for an efficient sequential forecasting
   methodology that can cope with this diversity. This paper proposes two
   approaches, a sequential k nearest neighbour and an extension of Markov
   models both with an added component based on sequence alignment. The
   proposed approaches exploit temporal categorical features of the data to
   predict the process next steps using higher order Markov models and the
   process outcomes using sequence alignment technique. The diversity
   aspect of the data is also added by considering subsets of similar
   process sequences based on k nearest neighbours. We have shown, via a
   set of experiments, that our sequential k nearest neighbour offers
   better results when compared with the original ones; our extension
   Markov model outperforms random guess, Markov models and hidden Markov
   models.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) is to govern data
   throughout its lifecycle as efficiently as possible and effectively from
   technical points of view. A core aspect is the question, where the data
   should be stored, since different costs and access times are entailed.
   For this purpose data have to be classified, which presently is either
   done manually in an elaborate way, or with recourse to only a few data
   attributes, in particular access frequency. In the context of
   Data-Warehouse-Systems this article introduces an automated and
   therefore speedy and cost-effective data classification for ILM. Machine
   learning techniques, in particular an artificial neural network
   (multilayer perceptron), a support vector machine and a decision tree
   approach are compared on an SAP-based real-world data set from the
   automotive industry. This data classification considers a large number
   of data attributes and thus attains similar results akin to human
   experts. In this comparison of machine learning techniques, besides the
   accuracy of classification, also the types of misclassification that
   appear, are included, since this is important in ILM.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The problem of non-iterative one-shot and non-destructive correction of
   unavoidable mistakes arises in all Artificial Intelligence applications
   in the real world. Its solution requires robust separation of samples
   with errors from samples where the system works properly. We demonstrate
   that in (moderately) high dimension this separation could be achieved
   with probability close to one by linear discriminants. Based on
   fundamental properties of measure concentration, we show that for M < a
   exp(bn) random M-element sets in R-n are linearly separable with
   probability p, p > 1-upsilon, where 1 > upsilon > 0 is a given small
   constant. Exact values of a, b > 0 depend on the probability
   distribution that determines how the random M-element sets are drawn,
   and on the constant upsilon. These stochastic separation theorems
   provide a new instrument for the development, analysis, and assessment
   of machine learning methods and algorithms in high dimension.
   Theoretical statements are illustrated with numerical examples. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{A remarkable amount of Twitter messages are generated every second.
   Detecting the location entities mentioned in these messages is useful in
   text mining applications. Therefore, techniques for extracting the
   location entities from the Twitter textual content are needed. In this
   work, we approach this task in a similar manner to the Named Entity
   Recognition (NER) task, but we focus only on locations, while NER
   systems detect names of persons, organizations, locations, and sometimes
   more (e.g., dates, times). But, unlike NER systems, we address a deeper
   task: classifying the detected locations into names of cities,
   provinces/states, and countries in order to map them into physical
   locations. We approach the task in a novel way, consisting in two
   stages. In the first stage, we train Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
   models that are able to detect the locations mentioned in the messages.
   We train three classifiers: one for cities, one for provinces/states,
   and one for countries, with various sets of features. Since a dataset
   annotated with this kind of information was not available, we collected
   and annotated our own dataset to use for training and testing. In the
   second stage, we resolve the remaining ambiguities, namely, cases when
   there exists more than one place with the same name. We proposed a set
   of heuristics able to choose the correct physical location in these
   cases. Our two-stage model will allow a social media monitoring system
   to visualize the places mentioned in Twitter messages on a map of the
   world or to compute statistics about locations. This kind of information
   can be of interest to business or marketing applications.}},

Title = {{metaSMT: focus on your application and not on solver integration}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{605-621}},

Abstract = {{Many applications from artificial intelligence and formal methods use
   decision procedures as their core solving engines. In this context,
   automated reasoning based on Satisfiability (SAT) or Satisfiability
   Modulo Theories (SMT) is very effective. For a given application,
   however, selecting the best reasoning engine is a daunting task
   requiring first-hand experience and insight into engine-specific
   implementation details. Developers have to decide which concrete engine
   to use and how to integrate the engine into an application. Although
   file formats, e.g., DIMACS CNF or SMT-LIB, standardize the input of SAT
   and SMT solvers, not all engines provide input interfaces compliant with
   these standards. When following the standard, advanced (and not
   standardized) features of the solvers remain unused and their
   integration is left to the users. This work presents metaSMT, a
   framework that eases the integration of existing reasoning engines into
   applications. Inspired by SMT-LIB, metaSMT provides a domain-specific
   language that allows for engine-independent programming and offers a
   generic interface to advanced features as an extra abstraction layer.
   State-of-the-art solvers for satisfiability and other theories are
   available via metaSMT with little programming effort. Language bindings
   for C++ and Python are provided. We show how metaSMT can be used as a
   portfolio consistency checker for SMT-LIB2 instances. The benchmark set
   of the category quantifier-free bit-vector theory from SMT-LIB (1.6 GB)
   is used for these experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and reinforcement learning are quite
   relevant to each other when performing intelligent optimization. They
   are both regarded as promising methods involving important components of
   evaluation and improvement, at the background of information technology,
   such as artificial intelligence, big data, and deep learning. Although
   great progresses have been achieved and surveyed when addressing
   nonlinear optimal control problems, the research on robustness of
   ADP-based control strategies under uncertain environment has not been
   fully summarized. Hence, this survey reviews the recent main results of
   adaptive-critic-based robust control design of continuous-time nonlinear
   systems. The ADP-based nonlinear optimal regulation is reviewed,
   followed by robust stabilization of nonlinear systems with matched
   uncertainties, guaranteed cost control design of unmatched plants, and
   decentralized stabilization of interconnected systems. Additionally,
   further comprehensive discussions are presented, including event-based
   robust control design, improvement of the critic learning rule,
   nonlinear H-infinity control design, and several notes on future
   perspectives. By applying the ADP-based optimal and robust control
   methods to a practical power system and an overhead crane plant, two
   typical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical
   results. Overall, this survey is beneficial to promote the development
   of adaptive critic control methods with robustness guarantee and the
   construction of higher level intelligent systems.}},

Abstract = {{Social Media has become one of the major industries in the world. It has
   been noted that almost three fourth of the world's population use social
   media. This has instigated many researches towards social media. One
   such useful application is the sentimental analysis of real time social
   media data for security purposes. The insights that are generated can be
   used by law enforcement agencies and for intelligence purposes. There
   are many types of analyses that have been done for security purposes.
   Here, the authors propose a comprehensive software application which
   will meticulously scrape data from Twitter and analyse them using the
   lexicon based analysis to look for possible threats. They propose a

Abstract = {{The demand for pervasive wireless access and high data rate services are
   expected to grow significantly in the near future. In this context, the
   deployment of Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) will enable important
   capabilities, such as high data rates and traffic offloading, providing
   dedicated capacity to homes, enterprises, and urban hotspots. Despite
   HetNet technology will be beneficial for future wireless systems in many
   ways, the massive cells diffusion has as a consequence an exponential
   increase of the backhaul traffic that can create congestion and collapse
   the backhaul network. Virtualization of networks and radio access allows
   the implementation of complex and efficient decisional processes for
   radio and network resource optimization, but the interaction between
   lower and upper layers during resource allocation decisions is still
   mostly unexplored. In this paper we propose an artificial intelligence
   based approach, with two interdependent decisional cores exchanging
   information, one aware of physical layer aspects and the other
   controlling pure network resources. The two iterative procedures aim at
   jointly optimizing the distribution of the traffic in the backhaul
   network and the users cell association, with the goals of minimizing the
   unsatisfied users data rate requests and minimizing the energy
   consumption reducing the number of activated cells, respectively.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{11-23}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Integration in industrial automation can be approached from the theory
   of Distributed Artificial Intelligence. One approach is the modeling of
   different production units by agents that interact through interaction
   protocols, which are implemented following a coordination mechanism.
   Under this approach, integration in automation can be achieved through
   the optimization of implicit interactions in such mechanisms. This paper
   presents a strategy for integrating industrial processes based on
   Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which consists of optimizing coordination
   mechanisms that implement conversations between agents, by using
   cultural algorithms. The cultural algorithm uses formal models of
   interaction protocols between agents, such as auction and tender, and
   the integration scheme comes from automation architectures based on MAS,
   to which their interactions are optimized. The proposed scheme enables
   data and service-oriented integration. The proposed strategy is applied
   in two industrial case studies related to the oil production process.

Title = {{A priori evaluation of simulation models preparation processes using
   artificial intelligence techniques}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{45-61}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Controlling the well-known triptych costs, quality and time during the
   different phases of the Product Development Process (PDP) is an
   everlasting challenge for the industry. Among the numerous issues that
   are to be addressed, the development of new methods and tools to adapt
   to the various needs the models used all along the PDP is certainly one
   of the most challenging and promising improvement area. This is
   particularly true for the adaptation of Computer-Aided Design (CAD)
   models to Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) applications, and notably
   during the CAD models simplification steps. Today, even if methods and
   tools exist, such a preparation phase still requires a deep knowledge
   and a huge amount of time when considering Digital Mock-Up (DMU)
   composed of several hundreds of thousands of parts. Thus, being able to
   estimate a priori the impact of DMU adaptation scenarios on the
   simulation results would help identifying the best scenario right from
   the beginning. This paper addresses such a difficult problem and uses
   artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to learn and accurately predict
   behaviours from carefully selected examples. The main idea is to
   identify rules from these examples used as inputs of learning
   algorithms. Once those rules obtained, they can be used on a new case to
   a priori estimate the impact of a preparation process without having to
   perform it. To reach this objective, a method to build a representative
   database of examples has been developed, the right input (explanatory)
   and output (preparation process quality criteria) variables have been
   identified, then the learning model and its associated control
   parameters have been tuned. One challenge was to identify explanatory
   variables from geometrical key characteristics and data characterizing
   the preparation processes. A second challenge was to build a effective
   learning model despite a limited number of examples. The rules linking
   the output variables to the input ones are obtained using Al techniques
   such as well-known neural networks and decision trees. The proposed
   approach is illustrated and validated on industrial examples in the
   context of computational fluid dynamics simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The estimation of software development efforts has become a crucial
   activity in software project management. Due to this significance, a few
   models have been proposed so far to build a connection between the
   required efforts to be employed, and the software size, time schedule,
   budget and similar requirements. However, various holes and slips can
   still be noticed in software effort's estimation processes due to the
   lack of enough data available in the initial stage of project's
   lifecycle. In order to improve the accuracy of time estimation in the
   software industry, this work used NASA projects dataset to train and
   validate the proposed model, which is based on Feedforward Artificial
   Neural Network. Moreover, Dragonfly Algorithm was used to provide
   optimal training, which in consequence offered more enhanced and
   accurate software estimation model. Randomly selected project datasets
   were used to test the proposed model, which resulted in clear enhanced
   results in comparison to similar estimation models. Different
   performance criteria were used to validate and accept the hypothesis
   suggested by this paper that the proposed model could be used in
   predicting the efforts required for various types of software projects.}},

Abstract = {{Constraints form an essential part of most practical search and
   optimization problems, and are usually assumed to be given. However,
   there are plausible real-world scenarios in which constraints are not
   known or can be only approximated, for instance when the process in
   question is complex and/or noisy. To address such problems, we propose a
   method that synthesizes constrains from examples of feasible and
   infeasible solutions. The method can produce linear, quadratic and
   trigonometric constraints that are guaranteed to separate the feasible
   and infeasible regions and minimize the number of terms involved. The
   synthesized constraints are represented symbolically and can be used to
   simulate, predict or optimize the original process. We assess
   empirically several characteristics of the method on three benchmarks,
   in particular the fidelity and the complexity of the synthesized
   constraints with respect to the actual constraints. We also demonstrate
   its application to a real-world process of concrete manufacturing.
   Experiments demonstrate that the method is capable of producing
   human-readable constraints that reflect well the underlying process and
   can be used to simulate it. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional relays, such as vector surge relay, frequency relay and
   rate-of-change-of-frequency relay, are usually employed for islanding
   detection; however, these conventional relays fail to detect islanding
   incidents in the presence of small power imbalance inside the islanded
   system. This study presents an islanding detection approach for
   synchronous type distributed generation using multiple features
   extracted from network variables and a support vector machine (SVM)
   classifier. Features are extracted from a sliding temporal window, whose
   width is selected so as to achieve the highest detection rate at a fixed
   false alarm rate. The SVM classifier is trained with linear, polynomial
   and Gaussian radial basis function kernels, and the parameters of the
   kernels are tuned to improve the classification performance. The
   application of the proposed method is illustrated for islanding cases
   associated with different power imbalance conditions, including small
   power imbalance conditions associated with the non-detection zone of
   conventional relays. Furthermore, variation of detection time as a
   function of power imbalance scenarios, which involve all probable
   combinations of deficit of active/reactive and excess of active/reactive
   power imbalance, is assessed in the testing phase. The performance of
   the proposed approach is evaluated and compared with those of
   conventional relays in terms of reliability and response time of
   islanding detection.}},

Abstract = {{In the article, the authors present the application of new optimization
   methods called Artificial Acari Optimization (AAO) and analyze it with
   other known algorithms for specific groups of benchmarks. The authors
   were inspired by the social behavior of Acari (mites) creating a
   strategy for herd searching for solutions. In the article results
   obtained for MO were compared with other algorithms belonging to swarm
   intelligence: particle swarm optimization (PSO), glowworm swarm based
   optimization algorithm (GSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC). In a
   benchmark test four functions often used in testing methods of
   optimization were applied. These functions include: Ackley - with a
   relatively uniform surface, having tens of local minimums and one global
   maximum with a much lower value than most of the local minimums; Sphere
   with a single plane, having just one minimum; Easom characterized by a
   constant plane over overwhelming majority of domain with only one steep
   minimum, and Eggholder function with uneven surface having dozens of
   local minimums, where local minimums are close to the value of the only
   one global minimum. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An architecture for a learning-based autonomic decision system}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Pages = {{268-282}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Since today's networks use traditional centralized management systems,
   the management became costly with the growth in the number of network
   equipments and available services. It became then clear that it was
   necessary to distribute the central management responsibilities
   throughout the network equipments.
   This article proposes an autonomic decision system with learning
   capabilities based on Artificial Intelligence concepts, to be used by
   network equipments in mesh-network environments without the need of a
   central knowledge. Considering a specific case of QoS routing, this
   system is able to establish bandwidth aware communication paths between
   pairs of nodes in a distributed approach, without the complete knowledge
   of the network and the available bandwidth of its links.
   To develop this system in a real network an architecture has been
   specified and built, denote as DistArch. This architecture provides all
   the functionalities to perform distributed autonomic decisions in
   large-scale networks.
   The results of this approach show that, by cooperating with neighbour
   network agents, even without a full knowledge of the network state, it
   is possible to establish bandwidth-aware communication paths as optimal
   as the ones obtained with a central decision approach that contains full
   network information, being able to react to network changes with a fast
   convergence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Music is a significant achievement of human activities and culture.
   Composing music is a complex and challenging task in that many factors,
   such as scale, key, chord, rhythm, and pitch, and their interactions
   need to be considered. With the advance of computer technology and
   artificial intelligence, automatic composition systems emerge and
   present some promising results. In particular, composing music through
   evolutionary algorithms has received increasing attention. Although
   evolutionary approaches are capable of generating compositions that
   follow music theory, these compositions are easily recognized as
   machine-made products due to their unpredictability in melodic
   progression, which is an important factor affecting a human's impression
   and feeling on a song. This paper aims for an automatic composition
   system that emulates human intelligence in music composition.
   Specifically, we propose the phrase imitation-based evolutionary
   composition (PIEC) to generate compositions by an evolutionary algorithm
   based on music theory and imitation of the characteristics and melodic
   progression of human-composed music. The PIEC conducts intraphrase and
   interphrase rearrangement to imitate the ascending/descending motion of
   phrases. Furthermore, we design four fitness functions for the PIEC to
   evolve compositions considering note distribution, interval variance,
   and music theory. The experimental results show that the proposed PIEC
   can effectively generate satisfactory compositions with the
   characteristics of the sample melody. The results also validate the
   effects of phrase imitation and the four fitness functions on
   evolutionary composition.}},

Abstract = {{The Intelligent Water Drop (IWD) algorithm is inspired by the movement
   of real water drops in a river. A water drop could find an optimum path
   to a lake or sea by interacting with the conditions of its surroundings.
   In the process of reaching such destination, the water drops interact
   with the river bed while they move through it. Similarly, the supply
   chain problem can be modelled as a flow of supply, manufacturing, and
   delivery stages that must be completed to produce a finished product and
   then to deliver it to the end user. The problem is to select one option
   that carries out the stage, e.g. for a supply stage, many suppliers
   could supply the component represented by it. As each stage is
   characterised by its time and cost, multi--objective optimisation
   algorithm is used to minimise the time to market and production cost,
   simultaneously. Focusing on this analogy, this paper proposes an
   approach to the supply chain problem using a multi--objective extension
   to the intelligent water drops algorithm. Artificial water drops,
   flowing through the supply chain, will simultaneously minimise the
   production cost and the time to market of every product in a generic BOM
   by using the concept of Pareto optimality. A widely-used notebook supply
   chain in literature is solved. We provide some performance metrics of
   the solution and compare the Pareto set computed by the proposed
   algorithm with the one returned by exhaustive enumeration.}},

Title = {{Multiple kernel learning using composite kernel functions}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{391-400}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) algorithms deals with learning the
   optimal kernel from training data along with learning the function that
   generates the data. Generally in MKL, the optimal kernel is defined as a
   combination of kernels under consideration (base kernels). In this
   paper, we formulated MKL using composite kernel functions (MKLCKF), in
   which the optimal kernel is represented as the linear combination of
   composite kernel functions. Corresponding to each data point a composite
   kernel function is designed whose domain is constructed as the direct
   product of the range space of base kernels, so that the composite
   kernels make use of the information of all the base kernels for finding
   their image. Thus MKLCKF has three layers in which the first layer
   consists of base kernels, the second layer consists of composite kernels
   and third layer is the optimal kernel which is a linear combination of
   the composite kernels. For making the algorithm more computationally
   effective, we formulated one more variation of the algorithm in which
   the coefficients of the linear combination are replaced with a
   similarity function that captures the local properties of the input
   data. We applied the proposed approach on a number of artificial
   intelligence applications and compared its performance with that of the
   other state-of-the-art techniques. Data compression techniques had been
   used for applying the models on large data, that is, for large scale
   classification, dictionary learning while for large scale regression
   pre-clustering approach had been applied. On the basis of the
   performance, rank was assigned to each model we used for analysis, The
   proposed models scored higher rank than the other models we used for
   comparison. We analyzed the performance of the MKLCKF model by
   incorporating with kernelized locally sensitive hashing (KLSH) also and
   the results were found to be promising. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) problem is an essential
   part of power system expansion planning, and it is an extremely complex
   nonlinear, nonconvex, mixed-integer optimization problem. Solution to
   such a computationally intensive problem is a challenge for any
   optimization algorithm. Consideration of security constraints makes the
   problem even more formidable. Although various conventional and
   metaheuristic methods have been used in the past to solve such problem,
   scope for better optimization techniques always remain. The artificial
   bee colony (ABC) algorithm is one of the newest swarm intelligence-based
   optimization algorithms, which has delivered promising results in
   solving numerical optimization problems. However, the algorithm is quite
   less efficient in solving real-life constrained engineering problems. In
   this paper, a modified ABC (MABC) algorithm is formulated by
   incorporating the idea of global attraction, universal gravitation, and
   by introducing modified ways of searching in various bees' phases of the
   ABC algorithm. The MABC is able to get better results in a very
   efficient manner, when used for solving various benchmark functions. The
   efficiency and effectiveness of the MABC algorithm in solving
   constrained engineering problems is demonstrated by solving TNEP
   problems for different systems. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 24
   bus system, South Brazilian 46 bus system, Colombian 93 bus system for
   direct current TNEP model, and Garver 6 bus system for alternating
   current TNEP model. Results confirm that MABC can be an attractive
   alternative to the existing optimization algorithms for solving very
   complex nonlinear engineering optimization problems in a real-world
   situation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an approach to detect the possibility of long-term
   voltage instability, based on online measurement of system bus voltages.
   An optimization framework is proposed to determine the maximum loading
   points, with different load increase patterns and different levels of
   reactive power output. The operating conditions so obtained are used as
   the training database for an artificial intelligence classifier based on
   the support vector machines. In an online application, the support
   vector machine classifier helps in detecting the probability of some
   generators operating at high reactive power output, which is an
   important indicator of an impending voltage collapse. The proposed
   framework is tested with the IEEE 39 bus and the Nordic 32 bus systems.
   The test results demonstrate that the proposed scheme gives reliable
   prediction of the power system long-term voltage stability.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in artificial intelligence are encouraging governments
   and corporations to deploy AI in high-stakes settings including driving
   cars autonomously, managing the power grid, trading on stock exchanges,
   and controlling autonomous weapons systems. Such applications require AI
   methods to be robust to both the known unknowns (those uncertain aspects
   of the world about which the computer can reason explicitly) and the
   unknown unknowns (those aspects of the world that are not captured by
   the system's models). This article discusses recent progress in AI and
   then describes eight ideas related to robustness that are being pursued
   within the AI research community. While these ideas are a start, we need
   to devote more attention to the challenges of dealing with the known and
   unknown unknowns. These issues are fascinating, because they touch on
   the fundamental question of how finite systems can survive and thrive in
   a complex and dangerous world.}},

Abstract = {{The field of computational models of argument is emerging as an
   important aspect of artificial intelligence research. The reason for
   this is based on the recognition that if we are to develop robust
   intelligent systems, then it is imperative that they can handle
   incomplete and inconsistent information in a way that somehow emulates
   the way humans tackle. such a complex task. And one of the key ways that
   humans do this is to use argumentation either internally, by evaluating
   arguments and counterarguments, or externally, by for instance entering
   into a discussion or debate where arguments are exchanged. As we report
   in this review, recent developments in the field are leading to
   technology for artificial argumentation, in the legal, medical, and
   e-government domains, and interesting tools for argument mining, for
   debating technologies, and for argumentation solvers, are emerging.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a number of noteworthy results have been achieved in various
   fields of artificial intelligence, and many aspects of the
   problem-solving process have received significant attention by the
   scientific community. In this context, the extraction of comprehensive
   knowledge suitable for problem solving and reasoning, from textual and
   pictorial problem descriptions, has been less investigated, but
   recognized as essential for autonomous thinking in artificial
   intelligence. In this work we present a challenge where methods and
   tools for deep understanding are strongly needed for enabling problem
   solving: we propose to solve mathematical puzzles by means of computers,
   starting from text and diagrams describing them, without any human
   intervention. We are aware that the proposed challenge is hard and
   difficult to solve nowadays (and in the foreseeable future), but even
   studying and solving only single parts of the proposed challenge would
   represent an important step forward for artificial intelligence.}},

Abstract = {{The development of highly humanoid sex robots is on the technological
   horizon. If sex robots are integrated into the legal community as
   ``electronic persons'', the issue of sexual consent arises, which is
   essential for legally and morally permissible sexual relations between
   human persons. This paper explores whether it is conceivable, possible,
   and desirable that humanoid robots should be designed such that they are
   capable of consenting to sex. We consider reasons for giving both ``no''
   and ``yes'' answers to these three questions by examining the concept of
   consent in general, as well as critiques of its adequacy in the domain
   of sexual ethics; the relationship between consent and free will; and
   the relationship between consent and consciousness. Additionally we
   canvass the most influential existing literature on the ethics of sex
   with robots.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous vehicles are one of the most spectacular recent developments
   of Artificial Intelligence. Among the problems that still need to be
   solved before they can fully autonomously participate in traffic is the
   one of making their behaviour conform to the traffic laws. This paper

   First it is discussed to what extent Dutch traffic law exhibits features
   that are traditionally said to pose challenges for AI \& Law models,
   such as exceptions, rule conflicts, open texture and vagueness, rule
   change, and the need for commonsense knowledge. Then three approaches to
   the design of law-conforming AV are evaluated in light of the challenges
   posed by Dutch traffic law, which includes an assessment of the
   usefulness of AI \& Law models of non-monotonic reasoning, argumentation

Title = {{Early prediction of radiotherapy-induced parotid shrinkage and toxicity

Abstract = {{Motivation: Patients under radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer often
   suffer of long-term xerostomia, and/or consistent shrinkage of parotid
   glands. In order to avoid these drawbacks, adaptive therapy can be
   planned for patients at risk, if the prediction is obtained timely,
   before or during the early phase of treatment. Artificial intelligence
   can address the problem, by learning from examples and building
   classification models. In particular, fuzzy logic has shown its
   suitability for medical applications, in order to manage uncertain data,
   and to build transparent rule-based classifiers.
   In previous works, clinical, dosimetric and image-based features were
   considered separately, to find different possible predictors of parotid
   shrinkage. On the other hand, a few works reported possible image-based
   predictors of xerostomia, while the combination of different types of
   features has been little addressed.
   Objective: This paper proposes the application of a novel machine
   learning approach, based on both statistics and fuzzy logic, aimed at
   the classification of patients at risk of i) parotid gland shrinkage and
   ii) 12-months xerostomia. Both problems are addressed with the aim of
   individuating predictors and models to classify respective outcomes.
   Methods: Knowledge is extracted from a real dataset of radiotherapy
   patients, by means of a recently developed method named Likelihood-Fuzzy
   Analysis, based on the representation of statistical information by
   fuzzy rule-based models. This method enables to manage heterogeneous
   variables and missing data, and to obtain interpretable fuzzy models
   presenting good generalization power (thus high performance), and to
   measure classification confidence.
   Numerous features are extracted to characterize patients, coming from
   different sources, i.e. clinical features, dosimetric parameters, and
   radiomics-based measures obtained by texture analysis of Computed
   Tomography images. A learning approach based on the composition of
   simple models in a more complicated one allows to consider the features
   separately, in order to identify predictors and models to use when only
   some data source is available, and obtaining more accurate results when
   more information can be combined.
   Results: Regarding parotid shrinkage, a number of good predictors is
   detected, some already known and confirmed here, and some others found
   here, in particular among radiomics-based features. A number of models
   are also designed, some using single features and others involving
   models composition to improve classification accuracy. In particular,
   the best model to be used at the initial treatment stage, and another
   one applicable at the half treatment stage are identified.
   Regarding 12-months toxicity, some possible predictors are detected, in
   particular among radiomics-based features. Moreover, the relation
   between final parotid shrinkage rate and 12-months xerostomia is
   evaluated.
   The method is compared to the naive Bayes classifier, which reveals
   similar results in terms of classification accuracy and best predictors.
   The interpretable fuzzy rule-based models are explicitly presented, and
   the dependence between predictors and outcome is explained, thus
   furnishing in some cases helpful insights about the considered problems.
   Conclusion: Thanks to the performance and interpretability of the fuzzy
   classification method employed, predictors of both parotid shrinkage and
   xerostomia are detected, and their influence on each outcome is
   revealed. Moreover, models for predicting parotid shrinkage at initial
   and half radiotherapy stages are found. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Intrusions constitute one of the main issues in computer network
   security. Through malicious actions, hackers can have unauthorised
   access that compromises the integrity, the confidentiality, and the
   availability of resources or services. Intrusion detection systems
   (IDSs) have been developed to monitor and filter network activities by
   identifying attacks and alerting network administrators. Different IDS
   approaches have emerged using data mining, machine learning, statistical
   analysis, and artificial intelligence techniques such as genetic
   algorithms, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, swarm intelligence,
   etc. Due to the high dimensionality of the exchanged data, applying
   those techniques will be extremely time consuming. Feature selection is
   needed to select the optimal subset of features that represents the
   entire dataset to increase the accuracy and the classification
   performance of the IDS. In this work, we apply a wrapper approach based
   on a genetic algorithm as a search strategy and logistic regression as a
   learning algorithm for network intrusion detection systems to select the
   best subset of features. The experiment will be conducted on the KDD99
   dataset and the UNSW-NB15 dataset. Three different decision tree
   classifiers are used to measure the performance of the selected subsets
   of features. The obtained results are compared with other feature
   selection approaches to verify the efficiency of our proposed approach.

Abstract = {{Security games are used for mathematically optimizing security measures
   aimed at minimizing the effects of criminal activity. Their use has been
   attracting attention in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and
   multi-agent systems, and they are now being put to practical use by
   several U.S. public agencies. However, the use of urban network security
   games to analyze the problem of catching criminals at road checkpoints
   is difficult, which has hindered their application to city-scale
   networks. To overcome this difficulty, we have developed min-cut
   arrangement and graph contraction algorithms. The min-cut arrangement
   algorithm identifies candidate checkpoint locations that maximize
   security. The graph contraction algorithm reduces the problem, leading
   to a dramatic reduction in computational time for urban network security
   games, for which the computational cost increases exponentially with the
   size of the problem. In this paper, we introduce these algorithms and
   present results for a 200,000-node problem centered on the 23 wards of
   Tokyo.}},

Abstract = {{Objective exams (OE) plays a major role in educational assessment as

   system of exams is a low quality of questions caused by some human
   factors, such as the traditional method for the development of the exam
   covers a narrow scope of curriculum topics. This does nothing for the
   separation of teaching process about the examination process. In this
   study we present a framework that generates three types of Objective
   exams questions (multiple choice questions (MCQ), true-false question
   (T/FQ), and complete Questions (CQ) from paragraphs of electronic
   course. The proposed framework consists of a lot of main stages, it uses
   both of the natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate
   three types of questions (GFQ, T/FQ, and MCQ), and exam maker (EM), it
   uses the generated questions to produce the objective exams. The
   proposed system was evaluated by the extent of its ability to generate
   multiple objective questions. The questions that have been generated
   from the proposed system was presented to the three of the arbitrators
   specialists in the field of computer networks to express an opinion on
   the extent of their relationship to E-course and the accuracy of
   linguistic and scientific formulation. The results of the study showed
   an increase in the accuracy and number of the objective exams that were
   generated through the proposed system compared to the accuracy and
   number of the exams created by the traditional system this proves the

Abstract = {{The presence of intelligence and rationality in Artificial Intelligence
   (AI) and the Internet requires a new context of analysis in which
   Herbert Simon's approach to the sciences of the artificial is surpassed
   in order to grasp the role of information in our contemporary setting.
   This new framework requires taking into account some relevant aspects.
   (i) In the historical endeavor of building up AI and the Internet, minds
   and machines have interacted over the years and in many ways through the
   interrelation between scientific creativity and technological
   innovation. (ii) Philosophically, minds and machines can have
   epistemological, methodological and ontological differences, which are
   based on the distinct configuration of human intelligence and artificial
   intelligence. Their comparison with rationality and its various forms is
   particularly relevant. (iii) Scientifically, AI and the Internet belong
   to the sciences of the artificial, because they work on designs that
   search for specific aims, following selected processes in order to
   achieve expected results. (iv) Technologically, AI and the Internet
   require the support of information and communication technologies (ICT).
   These have an instrumental role regarding the existence of AI and the
   Internet. Also ICT shape their diverse forms of configuration over the
   years.
   Within this framework, this paper offers a new context of analysis that
   goes beyond Simon's and follows four main steps: (i) the interaction
   between scientific creativity and technological innovation as the
   philosophico-methodological setting for Artificial Intelligence and the
   Internet; (ii) artificial intelligence and human intelligence as
   epistemological basis for machines and minds, where the differences
   between artificial intelligence and human intelligence are made explicit
   (under the consideration of ``computational intelligence'') and the
   analysis of minds and machines is made from the perspective of
   rationality ({''}symbolic rationality'' and ``adaptive rationality'');
   (iii) intention and its difference with design of machine learning are
   considered to distinguish human intelligence from artificial
   intelligence; and (iv) the internal and external aspects of artificial
   designs in contemporary society are considered through the perspective
   of rationality, which leads to the transition from intelligence to
   rationality in the Internet as well as to the historicity of information
   (how aims, processes, and results can be based on conceptual
   revolutions).}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a novel philosophical approach to the role of
   information on the internet. The link information-internet is analyzed
   from the perspective of the sciences of the artificial, to highlight
   aspects of this field that Herbert Simon did not consider. The analysis
   follows three steps: (1) the study of the development of Artificial
   Intelligence as the support of internet for communication processes.
   This analysis is made to clarify the new communicative designs. (2) The
   role creativity in the new communication designs is studied. In this
   regard, there is an interplay between the scientific creativity of human
   beings making designs and technological innovation of information and
   communication technologies. (3) The consideration of the transverse and
   longitudinal novelty that exist in the types of digital communication.
   They are based on AI built up as a science of the artificial. These
   types of novelty depend on the interaction between scientific creativity
   and technological innovation. A central aim of this paper on
   communication sciences from the perspective of sciences of design is to
   overcome SimonA ` s theoretical schemes. His view is mainly focused on
   structural complexity (holistic complexity and near decomposability).
   But communicative designs of the internet phenomena require the dynamic
   complexity. In addition, communication on the internet is based on an
   internal-external duality, which goes beyond Simon's approach on the
   artificial. Thus, the analysis takes into account the new types of
   communication (such as social networks) and their different levels
   (micro, meso, and macro).}},

Abstract = {{Machine awareness is a disputed research topic, in some circles

   Understanding what that is, under which conditions such feature could

   for computational intelligence, intended as the theoretical and
   practical ability of algorithms to design other algorithms for actions
   aimed at solving well-specified tasks. We know this ability is already
   shown by current AIs, and understanding its limits is an essential step
   in qualifying claims about machine awareness and Super-AI. We propose a
   formal translation of algorithmic iteration in a fragment of modal
   logic, formulate principles of transparency and faithfulness across
   human and machine intelligence, and consider the relevance to
   theoretical research on (Super)-AI as well as the practical import of

Abstract = {{Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases have been considered one of the dominant
   approaches to combining open world ontology languages with closed world
   rule-based languages. Currently, the only known inference methods are
   based on the approach of guess-and-verify, while most modern SAT/ASP
   solvers are built under the DPLL architecture. The central impediment
   here is that it is not clear what constitutes a constraint propagator, a
   key component employed in any DPLL-based solver. In this paper, we
   address this problem by formulating the notion of unfounded sets for
   non-disjunctive hybrid MKNF knowledge bases, based on which we propose
   and study two new well-founded operators. We show that by employing a
   wellfounded operator as a constraint propagator, a sound and complete
   DPLL search engine can be readily defined. We compare our approach with
   the operator based on the alternating fixpoint construction by Knorr et
   al. (2011. Artificial Intelligence 175, 9, 1528-1554) and show that,
   when applied to arbitrary partial partitions, the new well-founded
   operators not only propagate more truth values but also circumvent the
   non-converging behavior of the latter. In addition, we study the
   possibility of simplifying a given hybrid MKNF knowledge base by
   employing a well-founded operator and show that, out of the two
   operators proposed in this paper, the weaker one can be applied for this
   purpose and the stronger one cannot. These observations are useful in
   implementing a grounder for hybrid MKNF knowledge bases, which can be
   applied before the computation of MKNF models.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in machine learning, such as deep neural networks, have
   caused a huge boost in many different areas of artificial intelligence

   well-prepared and labelled training data, which limits the applicability
   to robotics. In our opinion, a fundamental challenge in autonomous
   robotics is to design systems that are simple enough to solve simple
   tasks. These systems should grow in complexity step by step and more
   complex models like neural networks should be trained by re-using the
   information acquired over the robot's lifetime. Ultimately, high-level
   abstractions should be generated from these models, bridging the gap
   from low-level sensor data to high-level AI systems. We present first

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel algorithm called variable population size
   artificial bee colony (VPS-ABC) optimization algorithm. VPS-ABC is
   proposed to overcome the impact of the effect of initial population and
   improve the convergence rate of classical ABC. The main idea is based on
   reducing the number of food sources gradually and moving the bees
   towards the global best food source in each re-initialization process.
   Moreover, an analysis for convergence of the ABC algorithm is proofed in
   details. The convergence analysis is based on the relation between ABC
   variants and the general solution of the food source regeneration
   equation. To show the fitness of the proposed algorithm, a comparison is
   made between VPS-ABC versus classical ABC, PSO, and GA algorithms in
   tuning the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers.
   Simulation results show that VPS-ABC algorithm is highly competitive,
   often outperforming PSO and GA algorithms.}},

Year = {{2017}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networking is a promising technology that can lead to
   automatic, intelligent, easier and more secure systems. A wireless
   sensor network (WSN) consists of small battery powered devices with
   limited energy resources. One of the major challenges in WSN lies in the
   energy constraint and computation resources available at the sensor
   nodes. One way to achieve energy efficiency would be through the use of
   a clustering technique. In this paper, we propose computational
   intelligence (CI) approaches to deal with the problem of sensor nodes
   clustering in a WSN with the ultimate goal to reduce energy expenditures
   and thus to extend the lifetime of the network. The main motivation is
   that CI brings about flexibility, autonomous behavior, and robustness
   against topology changes, communication failures, and scenario changes.
   The main features of the proposed work span over two aspects. First,
   four metaheuristics have been adapted to deal with the tackled problem
   namely genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, particle swarm
   optimization and artificial bees colony. In this context, a suitable
   solution representation scheme has been developed and accordingly the
   algorithms operators, and overall dynamics have been defined. Second,
   the four developed algorithms are combined with an exhaustive search
   that is triggered whenever the number of alive sensor nodes drops below
   a given threshold. The performance of the proposed algorithms has been
   assessed and compared to the most known state of the art clustering
   based method namely low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy algorithm
   (LEACH). The obtained results show that the proposed approaches optimize
   in an efficient manner the lifetime of WSNs. They also show that the
   proposed algorithms compete and even outperform LEACH algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Modern video games come with highly realistic graphics enabling the
   players to interact with visually rich virtual worlds. Realistic
   (life-like) animation of nonplayer characters (NPCs) in such virtual
   worlds is particularly important to enhance the gaming experience.
   Multiagent systems are one effective approach to synthesize life-like
   behaviors and interactions by codifying simple rules into NPCs (each NPC
   as an autonomous agent). However, such behaviors generally come at the
   cost of increasing computational expense and complexity in terms of
   aspects such as number of rules and parameters. Therefore, the desire
   for high fidelity (highly realistic) behaviors is often in conflict with
   the drive for low complexity. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms
   provide a sophisticated mechanism to optimize two or more conflicting
   objectives simultaneously. However, evolutionary computing techniques
   need an appropriate objective function to drive the exploration in the
   correct direction. Pairing of evolutionary techniques and multiagent
   systems is challenging in the classes of problems in which the fitness
   is evaluated based on human aesthetic judgment rather than on objective
   forms of measurements. In this study, we present a multiobjective
   evolutionary framework to evolve low complexity and high fidelity
   multiagent systems by utilizing a machine learning system trained by
   bootstrapping human aesthetic judgment. We have gathered empirical data
   in three problem areas-simulation of conversational group dynamics,
   sheepdog herding behaviors, and traffic dynamics, and show the
   effectiveness of our approach in deriving low complexity and high
   fidelity multiagent systems. Further, we have identified common
   properties of the Pareto-optimal frontiers in the three problem areas
   that can ultimately lead to an understanding of a relationship between
   simulation model complexity and behavior fidelity. This understanding
   will be useful in deciding which level of behavioral fidelity is
   required for the characters in video games based on the distance to the
   camera, importance to the scene, and available computational resources.}},

Abstract = {{Designing automatic drivers for car racing is an active field of
   research in the area of robotics and artificial intelligence. A
   controller called Ahura (a heuristic-based racer) for the open racing
   car simulator is proposed in this paper. Ahura includes five modules,
   namely steer controller, speed controller, opponent manager, dynamic
   adjuster, and stuck handler. These modules have 23 parameters all
   together that are tuned using an evolutionary strategy for a particular
   car to ensure fast and safe drive on different tracks. These tuned
   parameters are further modified by the dynamic adjuster module during
   the run according to the width, friction, and dangerous zones of the
   track. The dynamic adjustment enables Ahura to decide on-the-fly based
   on the current situation; hence, it eliminates the need for prior
   knowledge about the characteristics of the track. The driving
   performance of Ahura is compared with other state-of-the-art controllers
   on 40 tracks when they drive identical cars. Our experiments indicate
   that Ahura performs significantly better than other controllers in terms
   of damage and completion time especially on complex tracks (road
   tracks). Also, experiments show that the overtaking strategy of Ahura is
   safer and more effective compared to other controllers.}},

   containing the main evaluation rules of the most relevant full-body
   evaluation checklists. The approach aims to give an integrated value of
   the ergonomic assessment for the postures investigated, indicating also
   the ergonomic incidence of each posture. The methodology is applied to
   an industrial case of a setup activity. A comparison is carried out with

Abstract = {{Framing strongly influences actions among technology proponents and
   end-users. Underlying much debate about artificial intelligence (AI) are
   several fundamental shortcomings in its framing. First, discussion of AI
   is atheoretical, and therefore has limited potential for addressing the
   complexity of causation. Second, intelligence is considered from an
   anthropocentric perspective that sees human intelligence, and
   intelligence developed by humans, as superior to all other
   intelligences. Thus, the extensive post-anthropocentric research into
   intelligence is not given sufficient consideration. Third, AI is
   discussed often in reductionist mechanistic terms. Rather than in
   organicist emergentist terms as a contributor to multi-intelligence (MI)
   hybrid beings and/or systems. Thus, current framing of AI can be a
   self-validating reduction within which AI development is focused upon AI
   becoming the single-variable mechanism causing future effects. In this
   paper, AI is reframed as a contributor to MI.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are important for maintaining
   the system performance and guaranteeing the operational safety. The
   traditional data-driven approaches mostly incorporate well-defined
   features and methodologies such as supervised artificial intelligence
   algorithms. Prior knowledge of possible features and a large quantity of
   labelled condition data are needed. Besides, many traditional approaches
   require rebuilding or a retraining of the original model to diagnosis
   new conditions. The present study proposes an intelligent fault
   diagnosis approach that uses a deep neural network (DNN) based on
   stacked denoising autoencoder. Representative features are learned by
   applying the denoising autoencoder to the unlabelled data in an
   unsupervised manner. A DNN is then constructed and fine-tuned with just
   a few items of labelled data. The trained DNN achieves high performance
   in fault classification. Furthermore, new conditions can be correctly
   classified by simply fine-tuning the trained DNN model using a small
   amount of labelled data under the new conditions. The effectiveness of
   the proposed approach is evaluated using a case study of fault diagnosis
   of a bearing unit. The results indicate that the proposed method can
   extract representative features from massive unlabelled data on the
   system condition and achieve high performance in fault diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic sign recognition is a very important function in automatic
   driving assistance systems (ADAS). This study addresses the design and
   implementation of a vision-based ADAS based on an image-based
   speed-limit sign (SLS) recognition algorithm, which can automatically
   detect and recognise SLS on the road in real-time. To improve the
   recognition rate of SLS having different orientations and scales in the
   image, this study also presents a new sign content description
   algorithm, which describes the detected road sign using
   centroid-to-contour (CtC) distances of the extracted sign content. The
   proposed CtC descriptor is robust to translation, rotation and scale
   changes of the SLS in the image. This advantage improves the recognition
   accuracy of a support vector machine classifier trained using a large
   database of traffic signs. The proposed SLS recognition method had been
   implemented on two different embedded platforms, each of them equipped
   with an ARM-based Quad-Core CPU running Android 4.4 operating system.
   Experimental results validate that the proposed method not only provides
   a high recognition rate, but also achieves real-time performance up to
   30 frames per second for processing 1280x720 video streams running on a
   commercial ARM-based smartphone.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Distance metric learning has achieved great success in person
   re-identification. Most existing methods that learn metrics from
   pairwise constraints suffer the problem of imbalanced data. In this
   study, the authors present a large margin relative distance learning
   (LMRDL) method which learns the metric from triplet constraints, so that
   the problem of imbalanced sample pairs can be bypassed. Different from
   existing triplet-based methods, LMRDL employs an improved triplet loss
   that enforces penalisation on the triplets with minimal inter-class
   distance, and this leads to a more stringent constraint to guide the
   learning. To suppress the large variations of pedestrian's appearance in
   different camera views, the authors propose to learn the metric over the
   intra-class subspace. The proposed method is formulated as a logistic
   metric learning problem with positive semi-definite constraint, and the
   authors derive an efficient optimisation scheme to solve it based on the
   accelerated proximal gradient approach. Experimental results show that
   the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
   challenging datasets (VIPeR, PRID450S, and GRID).}},

   improve the popular locality-constrained linear coding method so as to
   obtain more meaningful and interpretable sparse codes for feature
   representation. Moreover, a new feature pooling strategy named kMaxSum
   pooling is proposed to alleviate the information loss of the sum pooling
   or max pooling strategy, which produces a more effective holistic image
   representation and can be viewed as a generalisation of the sum and max
   pooling strategies. The retrieval results carried out on two public
   image databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to introduce a noninvasive diagnosis
   procedure for aneuploidy and to minimize the social and financial cost
   of prenatal diagnosis tests that are performed for fetal aneuploidies in
   an early stage of pregnancy. We propose a method by using artificial
   neural networks trained with data from singleton pregnancy cases, while
   undergoing first trimester screening. Three different datasets' with a
   total of 122 362 euploid and 967 aneuploid cases were used in this
   study. The data for each case contained markers collected from the
   mother and the fetus. This study, unlike previous studies published by
   the authors for a similar problem differs in three basic principles: 1)
   the training of the artificial neural networks is done by using the
   markers' values in their raw form (unprocessed), 2) a balanced training
   dataset is created and used by selecting only a representative number of
   euploids for the training phase, and 3) emphasis is given to the
   financials and suggest hierarchy and necessity of the available tests.
   The proposed artificial neural networks models were optimized in the
   sense of reaching a minimum false positive rate and at the same time
   securing a 100\% detection rate for Trisomy 21. These systems correctly
   identify other aneuploidies (Trisomies 13\&18, Turner, and Triploid
   syndromes) at a detection rate greater than 80\%. In conclusion, we
   demonstrate that artificial neural network systems can contribute in
   providing noninvasive, effective early screening for fetal aneuploidies
   with results that compare favorably to other existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying and quantifying the influential factors on incident
   clearance time can benefit incident management for accident causal
   analysis and prediction, and consequently mitigate the impact of
   non-recurrent congestion. Traditional incident clearance time studies
   rely on either statistical models with rigorous assumptions or
   artificial intelligence (AI) approaches with poor interpretability. This
   paper proposes a novel method, gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs),
   to predict the nonlinear and imbalanced incident clearance time based on
   different types of explanatory variables. The GBDT inherits both the
   advantages of statistical models and AI approaches, and can identify the
   complex and nonlinear relationship while computing the relative
   importance among variables. One-year crash data from Washington state,
   USA, incident tracking system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness
   of GBDT method. Based on the distribution of incident clearance time,
   two groups are categorized for prediction with a 15-min threshold. A
   comparative study confirms that the GBDT method is significantly
   superior to other algorithms for incidents with both short and long
   clearance times. In addition, incident response time is found to be the
   greatest contributor to short clearance time with more than 41\%
   relative importance, while traffic volume generates the second greatest
   impact on incident clearance time with relative importance of 27.34\%
   and 19.56\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Most statistical analysis technologies use detection thresholds for
   fault diagnosis, which often cannot effectively characterize some
   specific faults in a statistical manner. However, the details and small
   changes in the faults can be exploited by deep learning-based feature
   representation. In this paper, we present a weighted time series fault
   diagnosis method to learn the deep correlations of faults and reduce the
   loss of fault information. Our model includes 2 key novel properties:
   (1) It can learn high-level abstract features of faults and the
   underlying fault patterns, which is particularly efficient for detecting
   incipient faults; (2) a mathematical framework of stacked sparse
   autoencoder-based fault diagnosis, with capabilities of multiple
   nonlinear mapping and complex function approximation, is presented. The
   monitoring performance was compared with multivariate statistical
   methods and conventional artificial intelligence methods on the
   Tennessee Eastman process data set, which is a well-known chemical
   industrial benchmark. The experimental results showed its performance
   gain over existing methods, especially for incipient faults that are
   difficult to detect with traditional technologies.

Abstract = {{Machine tool geometric inaccuracies are frequently corrected through the
   use of compensation tables available in machine tool controllers. Each
   compensation table contains a set of values that determine the
   incremental change in the commanded position of an axis given the
   current positions of the axes. While a five-axis machine tool, for
   example, can have at most 25 compensation tables, most machine tool
   controllers limit the number of compensation tables that can be
   implemented and provide constraints on the combinations of compensation
   tables that can be utilized. This work presents an artificial
   intelligence-based methodology to select and populate the optimal set of
   machine tool compensation tables when these limitations and constraints
   exist. Using data from an industrial five-axis machine tool to construct
   a kinematic error model, simulation results for the proposed methodology
   and a heuristic based on the impact of individual compensation tables
   when selecting six compensation tables are compared, and the proposed
   methodology is found to outperform the heuristic. The proposed
   methodology and a solution based on a full set of compensation tables
   are experimentally implemented on the machine tool and the mean
   volumetric error resulting from the proposed methodology is found to be
   only 25 mu m less than the volumetric error resulting from the full set
   of tables. The proposed methodology is then implemented in two more
   simulation studies where constraints are imposed on which combination of
   compensation tables could be used and which type of compensation tables
   could not be utilized. The resulting mean volumetric error was 7.0 and
   28.3 mu m greater, respectively, than the unconstrained solution.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an improved version of brain emotional learning (BEL) model
   trained via learning automata (LA) for speech emotion recognition.
   Inspiring from the limbic system in mammalian brain, the original BEL
   model is composed of two neural network components, namely amygdala and
   orbitofrontal cortex. In this modified BEL model, named brain emotional
   learning based on learning automata (BELBLA), we have employed the
   theory of the stochastic LA in error back-propagation to train the BEL
   model in decreasing the high computational complexity of the traditional
   gradient method. Hence, the performance of the model can be enhanced.
   For a speech emotion recognition task, we extract the usual features,
   such as energy, pitch, formants, amplitude, zero crossing rate and MFCC,
   from average short-term signals of the emotional Berlin dataset. The
   experimental results show that the BELBLA outperforms some opponents,
   like hidden Markov model, Gaussian mixture model, k-nearest neighbor,
   support vector machines and artificial neural networks, for this
   application.}},

Abstract = {{Live virtual machine migration can have a major impact on how a cloud
   system performs, as it consumes significant amounts of network resources
   such as bandwidth. Migration contributes to an increase in consumption
   of network resources which leads to longer migration times and
   ultimately has a detrimental effect on the performance of a cloud
   computing system. Most industrial approaches use ad-hoc manual policies
   to migrate virtual machines. In this paper, we propose an autonomous
   network aware live migration strategy that observes the current demand
   level of a network and performs appropriate actions based on what it is
   experiencing. The Artificial Intelligence technique known as
   Reinforcement Learning acts as a decision support system, enabling an
   agent to learn optimal scheduling times for live migration while
   analysing current network traffic demand. We demonstrate that an
   autonomous agent can learn to utilise available resources when peak
   loads saturate the cloud network.}},

Abstract = {{Recently a number of well-known public figures have expressed concern
   about the future development of artificial intelligence (AI), by noting
   that AI could get out of control and affect human beings and society in
   disastrous ways. Many of these cautionary notes are alarmist and
   unrealistic, and while there has been some push-back on these concerns,
   the deep flaws in the thinking that leads to them have not been called
   out. Much of the fear and trepidation is based on misunderstanding and
   confusion about what AI is and can ever be. In this work we identify 3
   factors that contribute to this ``AI anxiety{''}: an exclusive focus on
   AI programs that leaves humans out of the picture, confusion about
   autonomy in computational entities and in humans, and an inaccurate
   conception of technological development. With this analysis we argue
   that there are good reasons for anxiety about AI but not for the reasons
   typically given by AI alarmists.}},

Abstract = {{Representing and managing temporal knowledge, in the form of temporal
   constraints, is a crucial task in many areas, including knowledge
   representation, planning, and scheduling. The current literature in the
   area is moving from the treatment of ``crisp{''} temporal constraints to
   fuzzy or probabilistic constraints, to account for preferences
   and\textbackslash{}or uncertainty. Given a set of temporal constraints,
   the evaluation of the tightest implied constraints is a fundamental
   task, which is essential also to provide reliable query-answering
   facilities. However, while such tasks have been widely addressed for
   ``crisp{''} temporal constraints, they have not attracted enough
   attention in the ``non-crisp{''} context yet. We overcome such a
   limitation, by (i) extending quantitative temporal constraints to cope
   with preferences, (ii) defining a temporal reasoning algorithm which
   evaluates the tightest temporal constraints, and (iii) providing
   suitable query-answering facilities based on it.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTOMETRICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1179-1202}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is elaborating new criteria for
   evaluating the significance of the research results achieved by
   scientific teams. It is known, that the h-index (Hirsch index) is used
   to evaluate scientific organizations, as well as individual scientific
   workers. On the one hand, such a scientometric indicator as the
   ``h-index of a scientific organization{''} reflects the organization's
   scientific potential objectively. On the other hand, it does not always
   adequately reflect the significance that the results of a scientific
   team's research activity have for the scientific megaenvironment
   (scientific community). The i-index has an even greater disadvantage,
   being principally limited by the size of a scientific team, although
   h-index is also dependent on the number of publications. Not trying to
   diminish the significance of the traditional parameters for monitoring
   the research activity of scientific organizations, including the
   institutions of higher education, the authors stress the necessity of
   using not only the traditional indicators, but also other parameters
   reflecting the significance of a scientific team's research results for
   the scientific community. It should also not be forgotten that a
   scientific team is a social system whose functioning is not limited to
   the ``sum{''} of individual scientific workers' activities. The authors
   suggest new criteria of significance of research activity of scientific
   teams, which are suitable for the specific usage, hence they (the
   indicators) should be used with great caution; it is most appropriate to
   use the authors' criteria for analyzing the dynamics of the research
   activity of scientific teams (following the principle ``Compare yourself
   with yesterday's yourself{''}). The authors' proposed citation-based
   indicators make it possible to evaluate the true significance of
   research activity of a scientific team for the scientific community;
   while defining and justifying the new criteria, the authors also took
   into consideration the actuality of such a problem as the struggle with
   the self-citation effect (in a wider context-the problem of struggling
   with the artificial ``improvement{''} of the scientometric indicators).
   The methodological basis of the research is formed by the system,
   metasystem, probability statistic, synergetic, sociological and
   qualimetric approaches. The research methods are the analysis of the
   problem situation, the analysis of the scientific literature and the
   best practices of research activity management at the institutions of
   higher education (benchmarking), the cognitive, structural-functional
   and mathematical modelling, the methods of graph, set and relation
   theory, the methods of qualimetry (the theory of latent variables), the
   methods of probability theory and mathematical statistics.}},

Abstract = {{A new artificial intelligence (AI) model, called Bagging-LMT - a

   inventory map and eleven flood conditioning factors based on the
   Information Gain Ratio (IGR). The model was evaluated using precision,
   sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Root Mean Square Error, Mean
   Absolute Error, Kappa and area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve criteria. The model was also compared with four
   state-of-the-art benchmark soft computing models, including LMT,
   logistic regression, Bayesian logistic regression, and random forest.
   Results revealed that the proposed model outperformed all these models

Title = {{Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony algorithm with Differential Evolution}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{11-24}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Differential Evolution (DE) are two very
   popular and efficient meta-heuristic algorithms. However, both
   algorithms have been applied to various science and engineering
   optimization problems, extensively, the algorithms suffer from premature
   convergence, unbalanced exploration-exploitation, and sometimes slow
   convergence speed. Hybridization of ABC and DE may provide a platform
   for developing a meta-heuristic algorithm with better convergence speed
   and a better balance between exploration and exploitation capabilities.
   This paper proposes a hybridization of ABC and DE algorithms to develop
   a more efficient meta-heuristic algorithm than ABC and DE. In the
   proposed hybrid algorithm, Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony with
   Differential Evolution (HABCDE), the onlooker bee phase of ABC is
   inspired from DE. Employed bee phase is modified by employing the
   concept of the best individual while scout bee phase has also been
   modified for higher exploration. The proposed HABCDE has been tested
   over 20 test problems and 4 real-world optimization problems. The
   performance of HABCDE is compared with the basic version of ABC and DE.
   The results are also compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, namely
   Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO), Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) and Spider
   Monkey Optimization (SMO) to establish the superiority of the proposed
   algorithm. For further validation of the proposed hybridization, the
   experimental results are also compared with other hybrid versions of ABC
   and DE, namely ABC-DE, DE-BCO and HDABCA and with modified ABC
   algorithms, namely Best-So-Far ABC (BSFABC), Gbest guided ABC (GABC) and
   modified ABC (MABC). Results indicate that HABCDE would be a competitive
   algorithm in the field of meta-heuristics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Automatic feature extraction of time-series applied to fault severity

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{Signals captured in rotating machines to obtain the status of their
   components can be considered as a source of massive information. In
   current methods based on artificial intelligence to fault severity
   assessment, features are first generated by advanced signal processing
   techniques. Then feature selection takes place, often requiring human
   expertise. This approach, besides time-consuming, is highly dependent on
   the machinery configuration as in general the results obtained for a
   mechanical system cannot be reused by other systems. Moreover, the
   information about time events is often lost along the process,
   preventing the discovery of faulty state patterns in machines operating
   under time-varying conditions. In this paper a novel method for
   automatic feature extraction and estimation of fault severity is
   proposed to overcome the drawbacks of classical techniques. The proposed
   method employs a Deep Convolutional Neural Network pre-trained by a
   Stacked Convolutional Autoencoder. The robustness and accuracy of this
   new method are validated using a dataset with different severity
   conditions on failure mode in a helical gearbox, working in both
   constant and variable speed of operation. The results show that the
   proposed unsupervised feature extraction method is effective for the
   estimation of fault severity in helical gearbox, and it has a
   consistently better performance in comparison with other reported
   feature extraction methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Maximum Power Point Tracking controller (MPPT) is a key element in
   Photovoltaic systems (PV). It is used to maintain the PV operating point
   at its maximum under different temperatures and sunlight irradiations.
   The goal of a MPPT controller is to satisfy the following performances
   criteria: accuracy, precision, speed, robustness and handling the
   partial shading problem when climatic changes variations occur. To
   achieve this goal, several techniques have been proposed ranging from
   conventional methods to artificial intelligence and bio-inspired
   methods. Each technique has its own advantage and disadvantage. In this
   context, we propose in this paper, a new Bio- inspired MPPT controller
   based on the Ant colony Optimization algorithm with a New Pheromone
   Updating strategy (ACO\_NPU MPPT) that saves the computation time and
   performs an excellent tracking capability with high accuracy, zero
   oscillations and high robustness. First, the different steps of the
   design of the proposed ACO\_NPU MPPT controller are developed. Then,
   several tests are performed under standard conditions for the selection
   of the appropriate ACO\_NPU parameters (number of ants, coefficients of
   evaporation, archive size, etc.). To evaluate the performances of the
   obtained ACO\_NPU MPPT, in terms of its tracking speed, accuracy,
   stability and robustness, tests are carried out under slow and rapid
   variations of weather conditions (Irradiance and Temperature) and under
   different partial shading patterns. Moreover, to demonstrate the
   superiority and robustness of the proposed ACO\_NPU\_MPPT controller,
   the obtained results are analyzed and compared with others obtained from
   the Conventional Methods (P\&O\_MPPT) and the Soft Computing Methods
   with Artificial intelligence (ANN MPPT, FLC\_MPPT, ANFIS\_MPPT,
   FL\_GA\_MPPT) and with the Bio Inspired methods (PSO) and (ACO) from the
   literature. The obtained results show that the proposed ACO\_NPU MPPT
   controller gives the best performances under variables atmospheric
   conditions. In addition, it can easily track the global maximum power
   point (GMPP) under partial shading conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{We present a method of forecasting 24-h power load profile in state-wide
   power system in Poland. The presented method is based on a hybrid
   artificial intelligence system. It employs actual temperature forecasts
   prepared by Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational
   Modelling of Warsaw University. The machine learning part of the system
   consists of 24 instances of Hierarchical Estimator: a machine learning
   method that divides the problem into non-exclusive subproblems with the
   help of fuzzy clustering and combines results of fairly simple neural
   networks trained on those subproblems into one, possibly more accurate
   solution. The presented system also includes a part responsible for
   dealing with days that have distinct power load patterns, such as
   additional state holidays. That latter part uses 30 (or 33)
   appropriately arranged linear regressions.
   The proposed approach was tested on historical load data from Poland and
   a few other countries. The achieved MAPE varied from 1.08\% to 2.26\% in
   dependence on the country. Such errors are among the lowest achieved by
   the published methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Logic as a knowledge representation and reasoning language is a
   fundamental topic of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) course and includes
   a number of sub-topics. One of them, which brings difficulties to
   students to deal with, is converting natural language (NL) sentences
   into first-order logic (FOL) formulas. To assist students to overcome
   those difficulties, we developed the NLtoFOL system and equipped it with
   a strong assistance and feedback mechanism. In this work, first, we
   present that feedback mechanism. The mechanism can provide assistance
   before an answer is submitted, if requested, but mainly it provides
   assistance after an answer is submitted. To that end, it characterizes
   the answer in terms of completeness and accuracy to determine the level
   of incorrectness, based on an answer categorization scheme, introduced
   in this paper. The automatically generated natural language feedback
   sequences grow from general to specific and can include statements on a
   student's metacognitive state. Feedback is provided as natural language
   sentences automatically generated through a template-based natural
   language generation mechanism. Second, we present an extensive
   evaluation of the effectiveness of the assistance and feedback mechanism
   on students' learning. The evaluation of feedback with students showed
   that full feedback sequences lead to greater learning gains than
   sequences consisting of only flag feedback and bottom-out hints (n =
   226), and that generic, template-based feedback sequences are comparable
   to the utility of problem-specific hints generated by human tutors (n =
   120).}},

Abstract = {{World Wide Web is a continuously growing giant, and within the next few
   years, Web contents will surely increase tremendously. Hence, there is a
   great requirement to have algorithms that could accurately classify Web
   pages. Automatic Web page classification is significantly different from
   traditional text classification because of the presence of additional
   information, provided by the HTML structure. Recently, several
   techniques have been arisen from combinations of artificial intelligence
   and statistical approaches. However, it is not a simple matter to find
   an optimal classification technique for Web pages. This paper introduces
   a novel strategy for vertical Web page classification, which is called
   Classification using Multi-layered Domain Ontology (CMDO). It employs
   several Web mining techniques, and depends mainly on proposed
   multi-layered domain ontology. In order to promote the classification
   accuracy, CMDO implies a distiller to reject pages related to other
   domains. CMDO also employs a novel classification technique, which is
   called Graph Based Classification (GBC). The proposed GBC has pioneering
   features that other techniques do not have, such as outlier rejection
   and pruning. Experimental results have shown that CMDO outperforms
   recent techniques as it introduces better precision, recall, and
   classification accuracy.}},

   recognition of temporal data}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{406}},
Pages = {{133-145}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The human brain's ability to efficiently detect patterns from the
   continuous streaming sensory stimuli has been a source of constant
   intrigue for naturalists, and has set the course for the development of
   research into artificial intelligence. Efficient encoding of such input
   stimuli into discrete timing of events play a decisive role in the
   ability of the spiking neurons inside the human brain to compress,
   transmit and recognise information presented by the external
   environment. In this article, we introduce the spike-time or temporal
   encoding paradigm as an efficient general approach to data compression
   for the purpose of pattern recognition. The data compression through
   spike-time encoding not only dramatically reduces the volume of data
   required to capture discriminatory information leading to economical
   storage and transmission, but can also be used for pattern recognition
   in streaming data domain. We experimentally show that the spike-time
   data produced by the temporal encoding techniques achieve comparable
   (superior in some cases) performance of pattern recognition in
   comparison to the use of the whole raw data. This article also
   introduces a generalised background knowledge driven optimisation based
   temporal encoding framework for encoding time series data and as an
   illustration of this approach, further formulates a temporal encoding
   algorithm, namely GAGamma, designed to efficiently compress fMRI data
   using discrete spike-times. We have evaluated the temporal encoding
   algorithms on the benchmark Starplus fMRI dataset, and the results
   demonstrate the temporal encoding algorithm's ability to achieve
   significant data compression without sacrificing the performance of the
   pattern recognition in the compressed space. We also show that the
   GAGamma algorithm provides enhanced flexibility and control (compared to
   the state of the art temporal encoding algorithms) within the design
   framework of the temporal encoding problem for fMRI, leading to better
   quality of spike-time data. The proposed approach, by the use of
   efficient brain-like encoding mechanism, opens up new possibilities in
   information compression, communication and pattern recognition and thus
   is applicable to a range of new applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Natural language provides a rich combinatorial mechanism for encoding
   meanings - a finite set of words can express an unbounded number of
   thoughts. Framed in 2015 to extend the purpose of Zadeh's Z-numbers, a
   Z{*}-number is a perceptual symbol of the meaning of a natural language
   expression and consequently mentalese or internal speech. This article,
   through decomposition of the Z(x)-macro-parameters into its atomic
   constituents, presents a model for the endogenous arousal of thoughts
   during empathetic, bespoke comprehension of the real-world. Based on
   Minsky's Society of Mind, the framework is founded on the assimilation
   of multimodal experiences, a sense of `unified self and its derivatives
   (choice, interest, curiosity,etc.), objective and subjective components
   of knowledge, commonsense, and attention dynamics over a real-world
   scenario. The model attempts emulation of slow and fast thinking,

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{Artificial Intelligence (AI) was the inspiration that shaped computing
   as we know it today. In this article, I explore why and how AI would
   continue to inspire computing and reinvent it when Moore's Law is
   running out of steam. At the dawn of computing, Alan Turing proposed
   that instead of comprising many different specific machines, the
   computing machinery for AI should be a Universal Digital Computer,
   modeled after human computers, which carry out calculations with pencil
   on paper. Based on the belief that a digital computer would be
   significantly faster, more diligent and patient than a human, he
   anticipated that AI would be advanced as software. In modern
   terminology, a universal computer would be designed to understand a
   language known as an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), and software
   would be translated into the ISA. Since then, universal computers have
   become exponentially faster and more energy efficient through Moore's
   Law, while software has grown more sophisticated. Even though software
   has not yet made a machine think, it has been changing how we live
   fundamentally. The computing revolution started when the software was
   decoupled from the computing machinery. Since the slowdown of Moore's
   Law in 2005, the universal computer is no longer improving exponentially
   in terms of speed and energy efficiency. It has to carry ISA legacy, and
   cannot be aggressively modified to save energy. Turing's proposition of
   AI as software is challenged, and the temptation of making many
   domain-specific AI machines emerges. Thanks to Deep Learning, software
   can stay decoupled from the computing machinery in the language of
   linear algebra, which it has in common with supercomputing. A new
   universal computer for AI understands such language natively to then
   become a Native Supercomputer. AI has been and will still be the
   inspiration for computing. The quest to make machines think continues
   amid the slowdown of Moore's Law. AI might not only maximize the
   remaining benefits of Moore's Law, but also revive Moore's Law beyond
   current technology.}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{There are several commercial financial expert systems that can be used
   for trading on the stock exchange. However, their predictions are
   somewhat limited since they primarily rely on time-series analysis of
   the market. With the rise of the Internet, new forms of collective
   intelligence (e.g. Google and Wikipedia) have emerged, representing a
   new generation of ``crowd-sourced{''} knowledge bases. They collate
   information on publicly traded companies, while capturing web traffic
   statistics that reflect the public's collective interest. Google and
   Wikipedia have become important ``knowledge bases{''} for investors. In
   this research, we hypothesize that combining disparate online data
   sources with traditional time-series and technical indicators for a
   stock can provide a more effective and intelligent daily trading expert
   system. Three machine learning models, decision trees, neural networks
   and support vector machines, serve as the basis for our ``inference
   engine{''}. To evaluate the performance of our expert system, we present
   a case study based on the AAPL (Apple NASDAQ) stock. Our expert system
   had an 85\% accuracy in predicting the next-day AAPL stock movement,
   which outperforms the reported rates in the literature. Our results
   suggest that: (a) the knowledge base of financial expert systems can
   benefit from data captured from nontraditional ``experts{''} like Google
   and Wikipedia; (b) diversifying the knowledge base by combining data
   from disparate sources can help improve the performance of financial
   expert systems; and (c) the use of simple machine learning models for
   inference and rule generation is appropriate with our rich knowledge
   database. Finally, an intelligent decision making tool is provided to
   assist investors in making trading decisions on any stock, commodity or
   index. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A sub-space artificial neural network for mold cooling in injection

Abstract = {{The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) have considerably
   expanded over recent years. A new class of industrial systems is
   beginning to evolve that incorporates using high volume data and
   advanced analytics to better optimize product quality while reducing
   energy consumption. Artificial neural networks (ANN) when combined with
   advanced modeling and control, begins to form an AI platform that can be
   further enhanced for factories of the future. This paper provides a
   demonstration of such initial work that can be further developed for
   future systems in a generic way. When considering polymer processing
   such as plastic injection molding, the mold cavity temperature (MCT)
   profile directly relates to part quality and part reject rates.
   Therefore, it is desirable to optimize the mold cooling process using
   real time control of MCT as it directly affect part quality. However,
   MCT is affected by a number of interacting nonlinear dynamic parameters
   that are often neglected due to the challenge of quantifying such
   parameters. Advanced model based control algorithms are often used for
   providing improved control of complex systems. However, they depend on
   good model formulations that are analytically insufficient. An online
   intelligent system identification approach for the mold cooling process
   is developed and tested. An ANN is designed to adjust online sub-space
   parameters that govern a mold cooling model. Results demonstrate that
   this online ANN approach can be used to accurately predict the dynamic
   behavior of mold cavity surface temperature. This is key to many
   industrial systems where their states are not directly observable and
   uncertainties are unknown. The methodology can be readily adapted for
   different operating conditions as in this case of polymer processing and
   has good potential for its integration with advanced model based control
   schemes and cloud computing approaches for the next generation of
   machines. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely applied in recent
   traffic classification. However, the flow-level statistics are prone to
   improve the accuracies for some applications; however, to reduce the
   accuracies for others. To address the problem, the authors propose a
   cascaded traffic classifier that is composed of both several binary
   sub-classifiers and a multiclass sub-classifier. The authors first
   present theorems that show how to make an optimal cascade of
   sub-classifiers, and then design a cascaded classification algorithm for
   improving the accuracy of flow-level traffic classification. In
   addition, to improve the classification speed, the authors propose a
   parallel scheme for the cascaded classifier. The authors evaluate their
   approaches on the traces captured from entirely different networks.
   Compared with the previous multiclass traffic classifiers built in
   one-time training process, the cascaded classifier is superior in terms
   of the overall accuracy and the accuracy for each application.}},

Abstract = {{The fusion of ordered propositions is an important and widespread
   problem in artificial intelligence, but existing fusion methods have
   difficulty handling the fusion of ordered propositions. In this paper,
   we propose a solution based on consistency and uncertainty measurements.
   The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we propose
   the concept of convexity degree, mean, and center of basic support
   function to comprehensively describe the basic support function of
   ordered propositions. Second, we introduce entropy as a measure of
   uncertainty in the basic support function of ordered propositions.
   Third, we generalize the indeterminacy of the basic support function and
   propose a novel method to measure the consistency between two basic
   support functions. Finally, based on the above researches, we propose a
   novel algorithm for fusing ordered propositions. Theoretical analysis
   and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
   outperforms state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{It has been just over 100 years since the birth of Alan Turing and more
   than 65 years since he published in Mind his seminal paper, Computing
   Machinery and Intelligence (Turing in Computing machinery and
   intelligence. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1950). In the Mind paper,
   Turing asked a number of questions, including whether computers could
   ever be said to have the power of ``thinking'' ({''}I propose to
   consider the question, Can computers think?' `...Alan Turing, Computing
   Machinery and Intelligence, Mind, 1950). Turing also set up a number of
   criteria-including his imitation game-under which a human could judge
   whether a computer could be said to be ``intelligent''. Turing's paper,
   as well as his important mathematical and computational insights of the
   1930s and 1940s led to his popular acclaim as the ``Father of Artificial
   Intelligence''. In the years since his paper was published, however, no
   computational system has fully satisfied Turing's challenge. In this
   paper we focus on a different question, ignored in, but inspired by
   Turing's work: How might the Artificial Intelligence practitioner
   implement ``intelligence'' on a computational device? Over the past 60
   years, although the AI community has not produced a general- purpose
   computational intelligence, it has constructed a large number of
   important artifacts, as well as taken several philosophical stances able
   to shed light on the nature and implementation of intelligence. This
   paper contends that the construction of any human artifact includes an
   implicit epistemic stance. In AI this stance is found in commitments to
   particular knowledge representations and search strategies that lead to
   a product's successes as well as its limitations. Finally, we suggest
   that computational and human intelligence are two different natural
   kinds, in the philosophical sense, and elaborate on this point in the
   conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Fault diagnosis, including fault detection and isolation, is a critical
   task for computer networks. Among the various techniques used for online
   system-level diagnosis, we are interested in the approach based on
   temporal information processing. The delays of the computer networks are
   inevitable, and the fault localization process has to take into account
   bounded delays or the temporal constraints. Temporal information is
   fundamental in model-based diagnosis. There can be cycles or loops in a
   computer network, but the fault reasoning methods for such cases are
   seldom considered in the literature. This paper provides an analytic
   model based on the cyclic temporal constraint network (CTCN), which aims
   at the fault diagnosis of cyclic computer networks using temporal
   information. The goal of the proposed framework is twofold: given the
   network structures and the predetermined candidate fault causes, the
   CTCN model corresponding the computer network under test is formulated;
   based on the CTCN model, given the alarms sequences with timestamps, the
   fault diagnosis process is executed to determine the most likely fault
   cause(s) with its/their time interval(s) of occurrence(s). The reasoning
   method is dependent on time point and time distance information, with
   which the fault motivators (i. e., actors) and fault responders (i. e.,
   victims) can be identified. The calculation process consists of three
   steps: 1) establishment of the objective function; 2) determination of
   the fault propagation paths; and 3) determination of the expected states
   with a given fault hypothesis. Finally, the proposed method is
   demonstrated via an application study, and the effectiveness of our
   proposed method is verified.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRONICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Deep learning-based methods for stereo matching have shown superior
   performance over traditional ones. However, most of them ignore the
   inherent geometry prior of stereo matching when training, i.e. the
   reference image can be reconstructed from the second image in the
   visible regions. The reconstruction can be achieved by backward warping
   the second image using the disparity map of the reference image, while
   the visible regions can be calculated by left-right consistency check.
   This prior is useful especially when the ground truth disparity is
   sparse (e.g. the outdoor scene such as KITTI 2015). This prior
   incorporated into a two-stage end-to-end training process, both of which
   try to minimise the end-point-error with respect to the sparse ground
   truth disparity (supervised learning), and the reconstruction error
   (self-supervised learning). The predicted disparity and the
   reconstruction error of the first stage act as additional information,
   and are fed to the second stage to make further use of this prior
   knowledge to improve performance. Experiments on the challenging KITTI
   2015 dataset show that the method improves the results in the foreground
   region, and ranks first among all the published methods on the D1-fg
   metric.}},

Abstract = {{Scaled acquisition of high-quality structured knowledge has been a
   longstanding goal of Artificial Intelligence research. Recent advances
   in crowdsourcing, the sheer number of Internet and mobile users, and the
   commercial availability of supporting platforms offer new tools for
   knowledge acquisition. This article applies context-aware knowledge
   acquisition that simultaneously satisfies users' immediate information
   needs while extending its own knowledge using crowdsourcing. The focus
   is on knowledge acquisition on a mobile device, which makes the approach
   practical and scalable; in this context, we propose and implement a new
   KA approach that exploits an existing knowledge base to drive the KA
   process, communicate with the right people, and check for consistency of
   the user-provided answers. We tested the viability of the approach in
   experiments using our platform with real users around the world, and an
   existing large source of common-sense background knowledge. These
   experiments show that the approach is promising: the knowledge is
   estimated to be true and useful for users 95\% of the time. Using
   context to proactively drive knowledge acquisition increased engagement
   and effectiveness (the number of new assertions/day/user increased for
   175\%). Using pre-existing and newly acquired knowledge also proved
   beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{The CRN is a future generation wireless communication system that allows
   SUs to use the underutilized or unused spectrum, known as white spaces,
   in licensed spectrum with minimum interference to PUs. However, the
   dynamic conditions of CRNs (e.g., PUs' activities and channel
   availability) make routing more challenging compared to traditional
   wireless networks. In this tutorial, we focus on solving the routing
   problem in CRNs with the help of a clustering mechanism. Cluster-based
   routing in CRNs enhances network scalability by reducing the flooding of
   routing overheads, as well as network stability by reducing the effects
   of dynamicity of channel availability. Additionally, RL, an artificial
   intelligence approach, is applied as a tool to further enhance network
   performance. We present SMART, which is a cluster-based routing scheme
   designed for the CRN, and evaluate its performance via simulations in
   order to show the effectiveness of cluster-based routing in CRNs using
   RL.}},

Abstract = {{Supplier evaluation and selection is a complicated multiple criteria
   decision-making process which affects supply chain management (SCM)
   directly. Recent studies emphasize that artificial intelligence
   approaches obtain better performance than conventional methods in
   evaluating the suppliers' performance and determining the best
   suppliers. Hence, this study proposes a new robust genetic-based
   intelligent approach, namely gene expression programming (GEP), to
   improve the supplier selection process for a supply chain and to cope
   with the drawback of the other intelligent approaches in this area. The
   applicability of this method was exhibited by a case study in the
   textile manufacturing industry. To show the performance of the
   mathematical-genetic model, comparisons with four intelligent
   techniques, namely multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, radial
   basis function (RBF) neural network, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
   system (ANFIS) and support vector machine (SVM), were performed. The
   results derived from the intelligent approaches were compared by using a
   collected dataset from a textile factory. The obtained results
   demonstrated that first the GEP-based model provides a mathematical
   model for the suppliers' performance based on the determined criteria,
   and the developed GEP model is more accurate than the four other
   intelligent models in terms of accuracy in performance estimation. In
   addition, to verify the validity of the developed model, different
   statistical tests were used and the results showed that the GEP model is
   statistically powerful.}},

Abstract = {{Air pollution sources generally cannot be identified as the specific
   factories but certain industries. Focusing on this issue, a new method,
   based on an improved glowworm swarm optimization and remotely sensed
   imagery, was proposed to precisely orientate and quantify air pollution
   sources in this study. In addition, meteorological data and GIS
   information were also used to backtrack the pollution source. After
   that, in order to quantify the pollution of each factory in the study
   areas, three pollution indices, pollution gross (PG), pollution
   intensity, and area-normalized pollution (ANP), were proposed. As a
   result, the polluting contribution of each factory was listed, and the
   most polluting factories, which were bulletined as the key monitoring
   factories by the local authority, were accurately extracted. Among the
   pollution indices, ANP is the most robust, reliable, and recommended.
   Furthermore, the result also shows factory pollution background
   information achieved from the historical remote sensing data which can
   be used to improve the precision of identification. To our knowledge,
   this study provides the first attempt to address the problem of
   identifying a pollution source as originating from an individual factory
   based on remote sensing data. The proposed method provides a useful tool
   for air quality management, and the result would be meaningful to
   environmental and economic issue.}},

Journal = {{COGNITIVE COMPUTATION}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Decision-making processes have been extensively used in artificial
   intelligence and cognitive sciences to explain and improve individual
   and social perception. As one of the most typical decision-making
   problems, medical diagnosis is used to analyze the relationship between
   symptoms and diseases according to uncertain and inconsistent
   information. It is essential to investigate the structure of a set of
   records on different levels such that similar patients can be treated
   concurrently within a group. In this paper, we propose a novel
   clustering algorithm in a neutrosophic recommender system for medical
   diagnosis. First, we define new algebraic structures for the system such
   as lattices, De Morgan algebra, Kleen algebra, MV algebra, BCK algebra,
   Stone algebra, and Brouwerian algebra. Based on these algebraic
   structures, we construct a neutrosophic recommender similarity matrix
   and a neutrosophic recommender equivalence matrix. A consecutive series
   of compositions between the neutrosophic recommender similarity matrices
   is performed to obtain the neutrosophic recommender equivalence matrix.
   From this matrix, a lambda-cutting matrix is defined to conduct
   clustering among the neutrosophic recommender systems. Regarding the
   values of clustering validity indices, the Davies-Bouldin (DB) of the
   proposed method is approximately 20\% better than those of the methods
   of Sahin (Neutrosophic Sets and Systems. 2014;2:18-24), Ye (J Intell
   Syst. 2014;23(4):379-89), and Ye (Soft Computing 2016;1-7). Analogously,
   the IFV and simplified silhouette with criterion (SSWC) of the proposal
   are better than those of the relevant methods with the improvement
   percentages being 30 and 70\%, respectively. The results show that the
   proposed method is better than the related algorithms in terms of
   clustering quality whilst its computational time is slightly slower. The
   contributions of this research is significant in both algorithmic
   aspects of computational intelligence and and practical applications.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Learning algorithms are being increasingly adopted in various
   applications. However, further expansion will require methods that work
   more automatically. To enable this level of automation, a more powerful
   solution representation is needed. However, by increasing the
   representation complexity, a second problem arises. The search space
   becomes huge, and therefore, an associated scalable and efficient
   searching algorithm is also required. To solve both the problems, first
   a powerful representation is proposed that unifies most of the neural
   networks features from the literature into one representation. Second, a
   new diversity preserving method called spectrum diversity is created
   based on the new concept of chromosome spectrum that creates a spectrum
   out of the characteristics and frequency of alleles in a chromosome. The
   combination of spectrum diversity with a unified neuron representation
   enables the algorithm to either surpass or equal NeuroEvolution of
   Augmenting Topologies on all of the five classes of problems tested.
   Ablation tests justify the good results, showing the importance of added
   new features in the unified neuron representation. Part of the success
   is attributed to the novelty-focused evolution and good scalability with
   a chromosome size provided by spectrum diversity. Thus, this paper sheds
   light on a new representation and diversity preserving mechanism that
   should impact algorithms and applications to come.}},

Abstract = {{Who should decide how a machine will decide what to do when it is
   driving a car, performing a medical procedure, or, more generally, when
   it is facing any kind of morally laden decision? More and more, machines
   are making complex decisions with a considerable level of autonomy. We
   should be much more preoccupied by this problem than we currently are.
   After a series of preliminary remarks, this paper will go over four
   possible answers to the question raised above. First, we may claim that
   it is the maker of a machine that gets to decide how it will behave in
   morally laden scenarios. Second, we may claim that the users of a
   machine should decide. Third, that decision may have to be made
   collectively or, fourth, by other machines built for this special
   purpose. The paper argues that each of these approaches suffers from its
   own shortcomings, and it concludes by showing, among other things, which
   approaches should be emphasized for different types of machines,
   situations, and/or morally laden decisions.}},

Title = {{Setting accessibility preferences about learning objects within adaptive

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Higher and further education providers are facing the challenge of
   supporting the interaction needs of an increasing number of students who
   feature accessibility preferences to use both elearning contents and
   services. In the next future, we can expect that, within adaptive
   elearning systems, both automatic and manual procedures will
   interoperate to elicit users' interaction needs for ensuring
   accessibility. In this paper, we report findings from the user
   experience with the self-assessment of interaction needs, as part of a
   content personalization system, which tackles possible mismatches in the
   interaction between the user and the learning objects. All stakeholders
   involved in providing this service along with intended user groups
   (students with visual, auditory or mobility impairments, and without
   impairments) participated in the evaluation with over 100 users
   described in this paper. From the evaluation, results follow that our
   approach allows students to self-assess and report adequately their
   interaction preferences. Furthermore, the paper describes findings of
   interest and open issues about how massive online courses may address
   the accessibility needs of an increasing number of elearning users.}},

Abstract = {{An Intelligence direct torque control (DTC) of induction motor using
   multilevel inverter with space vector modulation (SVM) is proposed in
   this study. The novelty of the proposed intelligence technique is an
   artificial neural network (ANN), which is utilised for the DTC of the
   induction motor. Here, ANN has been trained by using the target
   parameters such as reference quadrature and direct axis voltage with the
   corresponding input parameters change in motor torque and flux. The
   change in motor torque and flux parameters are identified by using the
   multilevel inverter output voltage and current. The back propagation
   process is used for the training process of the ANN. By using the ANN
   outputs, the SVM technique develops the control pulses for the
   multilevel inverter. Then the proposed intelligence technique is
   implemented in the MATLAB/simulink platform and the effectiveness is
   analysed by comparing with the different case studies and different

Abstract = {{Flexible temperature and mechanical sensing capabilities are of great

   mechanical sensitivity to strains in the range of 0\%-0.1\% with a gauge
   factor over 400 was attributed to the disconnection-reconnection process
   of the ziplike nanoscale cracks under strain or vibration. And the
   enhanced temperature sensing performance with a resolution of 0.1 K was
   attributed to the high temperature coefficient of resistance of VO2
   material. The temperature and the mechanical signals simultaneously
   recorded in the electrical resistance signal were separated via fast
   Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT. The flexibility and
   ultra-sensitivity to temperature and vibration make the sensor a

Journal = {{COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{50-68}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this work, the problems of knowledge acquisition and information
   processing are explored in relation to the definitions of concepts and
   conceptual processing, and their implications for artificial agents.
   The discussion focuses on views of cognition as a dynamic property in
   which the world is actively represented in grounded mental states which
   only have meaning in the action context. Reasoning is understood as an
   emerging property consequence of actions-environment couplings achieved
   through experience, and concepts as situated and dynamic phenomena
   enabling behaviours.
   Re-framing the characteristics of concepts is considered crucial to
   overcoming settled beliefs and reinterpreting new understandings in
   artificial systems.
   The first part presents a review of concepts from cognitive sciences.
   Support is found for views on grounded and embodied cognition,
   describing concepts as dynamic, flexible, context-dependent, and
   distributedly coded.
   That is argued to contrast with many technical implementations assuming
   concepts as categories, whilst explains limitations when grounding
   amodal symbols, or in unifying learning, perception and reasoning.
   The characteristics of concepts are linked to methods of active
   inference, self-organization, and deep learning to address challenges
   posed and to reinterpret emerging techniques.
   In a second part, an architecture based on deep generative models is
   presented to illustrate arguments elaborated. It is evaluated in a
   navigation task, showing that sufficient representations are created
   regarding situated behaviours with no semantics imposed on data.
   Moreover, adequate behaviours are achieved through a dynamic integration
   of perception and action in a single representational domain and
   process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{210-224}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{For manufacturers, forecasting the future yield of a product is a
   critical task. However, a yield learning process involves considerable
   uncertainty, rendering the task difficult. Although a few fuzzy
   collaborative intelligence (FCI) methods have been proposed in recent
   years, they are not problem-free. Hence, to overcome the challenges
   associated with these methods and to improve the accuracy of future
   yield forecasts, a heterogeneous FCI approach is proposed in this study.
   In this method, an expert applies mathematical-programming-based or
   artificial-neural-network-based methods (i.e., heterogeneous methods) to
   model an uncertain yield learning process. Subsequently, fuzzy
   intersection narrows the possible range of the future yield, and
   finally, an artificial neural network derives a crisp (representative)
   value. The effectiveness of the proposed heterogeneous FCI approach was
   successfully demonstrated by considering data obtained from a factory
   manufacturing dynamic random access memory devices. The approach
   achieved an average increase of 21\% in the forecasting accuracy
   compared with existing approaches. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{293-314}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, a bio-inspired computational intelligence
   technique is developed for finding the solutions of the celebrated
   Falkner-Skan equation arising in fluid mechanics problems using
   feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Genetic Algorithms (GA),
   the Active-Set (AS) method and their combination namely a GA-AS
   approach. The differential equations based ANNs modeling of the
   Falkner-Skan system is constructed by defining an unsupervised error
   function. The training of the design parameters of ANNs is carried out
   with the help of viable global search through GAs and fine tuning of the
   results is achieved with an efficient local search using the AS method.
   The proposed scheme is applied to a number of scenarios for the
   Falkner-Skan system based on boundary layer flow over a moving wall with
   mass transfer in the presence of a free stream with power-law velocity
   distributions. The dynamics of the system are investigated for different
   cases of mass transfer and wall stretching. The proposed results are
   compared with analytical and numerical solutions to verify the
   correctness of the approach. The accuracy and convergence of the
   proposed solver are validated through sufficient large numbers of
   independent runs in terms of different performance indices based on mean
   absolute error, Thails inequality coefficient and Nash-Suitcliff
   efficiency. These solutions greatly enrich possible approaches for
   stochastic numerical solution of the celebrated Falkner-Skan system. (C)

   intelligence-inspired optimization approach}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{708-726}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve
   continuous non-linear optimization problems. The presented algorithm is
   a collective global search inspired by the swarm artificial intelligent
   of coordinated robots. Cooperative recognition and sensing by a swarm of
   mobile robots have been fundamental inspirations for development of
   Swarm Robotics Search \& Rescue (SRSR). Swarm robotics is an approach
   with the aim of coordinating multi-robot systems which consist of
   numbers of mostly uniform simple physical robots. The ultimate aim is to
   emerge an eligible cooperative behavior either from interactions of
   autonomous robots with the environment or their mutual interactions
   between each other. In this algorithm, robots which represent initial
   solutions in SRSR terminology have a sense of environment to detect
   victim in a search \& rescue mission at a disaster site. In fact,
   victims location refers to global best solution in SRSR algorithm. The
   individual with the highest rank in the swarm is called master and
   remaining robots will play role of slaves. However, this leadership and
   master position can be transitioned from one robot to another one during
   mission. Having the supervision of master robot accompanied with
   abilities of slave robots for sensing the environment, this
   collaborative search assists the swarm to rapidly find the location of
   victim and subsequently a successful mission. In order to validate
   effectiveness and optimality of proposed algorithm, it has been applied
   on several standard benchmark functions and a practical electric power
   system problem in several real size cases. Finally, simulation results
   have been compared with those of some well-known algorithms. Comparison
   of results demonstrates superiority of presented algorithm in terms of
   quality solutions and convergence speed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Multimodal optimization (MMO) aiming to locate multiple optimal (or
   near-optimal) solutions in a single simulation run has practical
   relevance to problem solving across many fields. Population-based
   meta-heuristics have been shown particularly effective in solving MMO
   problems, if equipped with specifically-designed diversity-preserving
   mechanisms, commonly known as niching methods. This paper provides an
   updated survey on niching methods. This paper first revisits the
   fundamental concepts about niching and its most representative schemes,
   then reviews the most recent development of niching methods, including
   novel and hybrid methods, performance measures, and benchmarks for their
   assessment. Furthermore, this paper surveys previous attempts at
   leveraging the capabilities of niching to facilitate various
   optimization tasks (e.g., multiobjective and dynamic optimization) and
   machine learning tasks (e.g., clustering, feature selection, and
   learning ensembles). A list of successful applications of niching
   methods to real-world problems is presented to demonstrate the
   capabilities of niching methods in providing solutions that are
   difficult for other optimization methods to offer. The significant
   practical value of niching methods is clearly exemplified through these
   applications. Finally, this paper poses challenges and research
   questions on niching that are yet to be appropriately addressed.
   Providing answers to these questions is crucial before we can bring more
   fruitful benefits of niching to real-world problem solving.}},

Abstract = {{Radar emitter classification (REC) is very important in both civil and
   military fields. It becomes more and more difficult to classify the
   intercepted radar signals with the increasing complexity of radar
   signals. An efficient classification method using weighted-xgboost
   (w-xgboost) model for the complex radar signals is proposed in this
   study. The xgboost method is widely used by data scientists and performs
   very well in many machine learning projects. The authors use a large
   data set which consists of different types of attributes (such as
   continuous data, categorical data, and discrete data) to train the
   model. A smooth weight function is introduced to solve the data
   deviation problem. Experiment results show that the authors' w-xgboost
   method achieves a better performance than several existing machine
   learning algorithms on the test set.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{637-645}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Owing to the importance of rolling bearings in mechanical systems, many
   meaningful works have been presented for bearing degradation assessment.
   However, most of contributions fail to take into account the influence
   of input features on the performance of a degradation model. As a
   potential multivariable process control method considering serial
   correlations, canonical variate analysis (CVA) is introduced to detect
   abnormal behaviours of rolling bearings. This study combines the CVA and
   support vector data description (SVDD) to develop a robust approach to
   weaken or remove the negative impact of input data on bearing
   degradation estimation. First, the time-domain features extracted from
   healthy vibration signals are fused by CVA to generate projection data
   for SVDD training. Second, the distance of new variables to the centre
   of the hypersphere is calculated as an indicator to describe the
   degradation of rolling bearings. To demonstrate the effectiveness and
   robustness of the proposed method, two different experiments on bearing
   run-to-failure tests are conducted. Experimental results validate that
   the proposed work is capable of detecting bearing failure under various
   working conditions. Besides, comparison of the proposed work with the
   original CVA is implemented. The robustness of the proposed work is
   enhanced obviously compared with the original CVA.}},

Abstract = {{A large amount of data is generated through monitoring, maintenance,
   repair and diagnostics of power transformer. However, all these data
   cannot preindicate the exact type and probability of failure. To
   overcome the problem this paper presents artificial intelligence based
   methodology for power transformers fault detection and classification.
   The possibility of presented monitoring methodology is to assist the
   operator's engineers in decision making about urgency of intervention
   and type of maintenance of power transformer. The article analyzes the
   application of Mamdani-model and Sugeno-model in fuzzy expert system for
   fault diagnosis based on the current state of the power transformer.
   Paper presents two case studies with one unique and five separate
   controllers. In the first case inputs of controller are results of
   on-line and off-line transformer tests: age, the overheating temperature
   of the hot spot, frequency response analysis, temperature of insulation,
   dissolved gas-in-oil analysis, tg delta and polarization index. Second
   case study in addition to the existing inputs includes previous
   measurements. A fuzzy controller (FC) is designed to characterize the
   operating condition and to determine the urgency of intervention with
   possibility to indicate probability of specific type of failure.
   Cumulative probability of occurrence of the faults is also observed in
   second case study. FCs are tested based on real measurements from
   Serbian transmission system. The results show acceptable effectiveness
   in detecting different faults and might serve as a good orientation in
   the power transformer condition monitoring. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{IET COMPUTER VISION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{331-341}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In manifold learning, alignment is performed with the objective of
   deriving the global low-dimensional coordinates of input data from their
   local coordinates. In virtually all alignment processes, the relation
   between the local and global coordinates is designed intuitively,
   without mathematical deduction and detailed analysis. In this study, the
   authors propose a local non-linear alignment manifold learning algorithm
   (LNA) for non-linear dimensionality reduction, based on the concept of
   local pullback and the mathematical characteristics of a manifold.
   According to mathematical manifold theory, a function defined on a
   manifold cannot be differentiated directly on the manifold directly.
   Instead, it has to be pulled back to Euclidean space with the help of
   local homeomorphism between the manifold and Euclidean space, where it
   is then differentiated. In the authors' proposed algorithm, the
   component functions of global homeomorphism are regarded as the
   functions defined on the manifold and pulled back to the Euclidean
   space. Then, Taylor expansion is utilised up to the second order to
   establish the relation between the global and local coordinates. The
   objective function in LNA is based on the alignment error and can be
   solved with an eigenvalue problem. The experimental results conducted on
   various datasets verify the validity of the authors' method.}},

Abstract = {{The complexity associated with the in-homogeneous nature of concrete
   suggests the necessity of conducting more in-depth behavioral analysis
   of this material in terms of different loading configurations.
   Distinctive feature of Gene Expression Programming (GEP) has been
   employed to derive computer-aided prediction models for the multiaxial
   strength of concrete under true-triaxial loading. The proposed models
   correlate the concrete true-triaxial strength (sigma(1)) to mix design
   parameters and principal stresses (sigma(2),sigma(3)), needless of
   conducting any time-consuming laboratory experiments. A comprehensive
   true-triaxial database is obtained from the literature to build the
   proposed models, subsequently implemented for the verification purposes.
   External validations as well as sensitivity analysis are further carried
   out using several statistical criteria recommended by researchers. More,
   they demonstrate superior performance to the other existing empirical
   and analytical models. The proposed design equations can readily be used
   for pre-design purposes or may be used as a fast check on deterministic
   solutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Fast scene analysis using vision and artificial intelligence for object
   prehension by an assistive robot}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{33-44}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Robotic assistance for people affected by motor deficits is a fast
   growing field. In this context, two major challenges remain in terms of
   automated scene analysis and automated object prehension. More
   specifically, the most robust of current segmentation methods are still
   computationally intensive, preventing the automation of objects
   prehension from being fast enough to be considered acceptable as an
   everyday technical-aid. The objective of this study is to develop a fast
   scene analysis using vision and artificial intelligence for object
   prehension by an assistive robot.
   The solution developed in this paper aims at facilitating human-machine
   interaction by enabling users to easily communicate their needs to the
   technical aid. To achieve this, this paper proposes several novelties in
   three interconnected domains: scene segmentation, prehension and
   recognition of 3D objects. A novel technic, inspired by mechanical
   probing, is developed for scenes probing to detect objects. A simple,
   fast and effective decision tree is proposed for object prehension.
   Finally, the physical characteristics of the 3D objects are directly
   used in the neural network without using discriminants features
   descriptors.
   The results obtained in this paper have shown that scene analysis for
   robotic object prehension in cooperation with a user can be performed
   with effective promptness. Indeed, the system requires on average 0.6 s
   to analyze an object in a scene. With the JACO robotic assistance arm,
   the system can pick up a requested object in 15 s while moving at 50
   mm/s, which may be greatly improved upon using a faster robot. The
   system performance averages 83\% accuracy for object recognition and is
   able to use a decision tree to select a simple approach path for the
   robot end-effector towards a desired object. This system, in combination
   with an assistive robot, has great potential for providing users
   suffering from musculoskeletal disorders with improved autonomy and
   independence, and for encouraging sustained usage of this type of
   technical aids. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Automatic Density Peaks Clustering Using DNA Genetic Algorithm Optimized
   Data Field and Gaussian Process}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Clustering by fast search and finding of Density Peaks ( called as DPC)
   introduced by Alex Rodriguez and Alessandro Laio attracted much
   attention in the field of pattern recognition and artificial
   intelligence. However, DPC still has a lot of defects that are not
   resolved. Firstly, the local density rho(i) of point i is affected by
   the cutoff distance dc, which can influence the clustering result,
   especially for small real-world cases. Secondly, the number of clusters
   is still found intuitively by using the decision diagram to select the
   cluster centers. In order to overcome these defects, this paper proposes
   an automatic density peaks clustering approach using DNA genetic
   algorithm optimized data field and Gaussian process (referred to as
   ADPC-DNAGA). ADPC-DNAGA can extract the optimal value of threshold with
   the potential entropy of data field and automatically determine the
   cluster centers by Gaussian method. For any data set to be clustered,
   the threshold can be calculated from the data set objectively rather
   than the empirical estimation. The proposed clustering algorithm is
   benchmarked on publicly available synthetic and real-world datasets
   which are commonly used for testing the performance of clustering
   algorithms. The clustering results are compared not only with that of
   DPC but also with that of several well-known clustering algorithms such
   as Affinity Propagation, DBSCAN and Spectral Cluster. The experimental
   results demonstrate that our proposed clustering algorithm can find the
   optimal cutoff distance d(c), to automatically identify clusters,
   regardless of their shape and dimension of the embedded space, and can
   often outperform the comparisons.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{399}},
Pages = {{30-42}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Limited by visual percepts elicited by existing visual prosthesis, it's
   necessary to enhance its functionality to fulfill some challenging tasks
   for the blind such as obstacle avoidance. This paper argues that spiking
   neural networks (SNN) are effective techniques for object recognition
   and introduces for the first time a SNN model for obstacle recognition
   to assist blind people wearing prosthetic vision devices by modelling
   and classifying spatiotemporal (ST) video data. The proposed methodology
   is based on a novel spiking neural network architecture, called NeuCube
   as a general framework for video data modelling in simulated prosthetic
   vision. As an integrated environment including spiking trains encoding,
   input variable mapping, unsupervised reservoir training and supervised
   classifier training, the NeuCube consists of a spiking neural network
   reservoir (SNNr) and a dynamic evolving spiking neural network
   classifier (deSNN). First, input data is captured by visual prosthesis,
   then ST feature extraction is utilized in the low-resolution prosthetic
   vision generated by prostheses. Finally such ST features are fed to the
   NeuCube to output classification result of obstacle analysis for an
   early warning system to be activated. Experiments on collected video
   data and comparison with other computational intelligence methods
   indicate promising results. This makes it possible to directly utilize
   available neuromorphic hardware chips, embedded in visual prostheses, to
   enhance significantly their functionality. The proposed NeuCube-based
   obstacle avoidance methodology provides useful guidance to the blind,
   thus offering a significant improvement of current prostheses and
   potentially benefiting future prosthesis wearers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization in least squares support
   vector regression for obtaining bridge scour information}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{399}},
Pages = {{64-80}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The scouring of stream and river channels is a complicated phenomenon;
   it is a function of flow energy, sediment transport, and bridge
   substructure characteristics that challenges bridge engineers worldwide.
   Scour is also a major cause of bridge failure, thus contributing
   substantially to the total construction and maintenance costs of a
   typical bridge. Accurately estimating local scour depth near bridge
   piers is vital in engineering design and management. Thus, an effective
   technique is necessary to estimate the safety and economy of bridge
   design and management projects. This study developed a novel hybrid
   smart artificial firefly colony algorithm (SAFCA)-based support vector
   regression (SAFCAS) model for predicting bridge scour depth near piers.
   The SAFCAS integrates a firefly algorithm (FA), chaotic maps, adaptive
   inertia weight, Levy flight, and support vector regression (SVR). First,
   adaptive approaches and randomization methods were incorporated into the
   FA to construct a novel metaheuristic algorithm for global optimization.
   An SVR model was then optimized through SAFCA to maximize its
   generalization performance. Laboratory and field data reported in the
   literature were applied to evaluate the proposed hybrid model. The
   effectiveness of the proposed intelligence fusion system was evaluated
   by comparing the SAFCAS modeling results with those of numerical
   predictive models and with the results of empirical methods. For the
   bridge scour depth problem, the proposed hybrid model achieved
   3.99\%-87.12\% better error rates compared with other predictive
   methods, as measured through cross-fold validation algorithms and
   hypothesis testing. The resulting SAFCAS model can infer decisive
   information to assist civil engineers in designing safe and
   cost-effective bridge substructures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Today's propositional satisfiability (SAT) solvers are extremely
   powerful and can be used as an efficient back-end for solving
   NP-complete problems. However, many fundamental problems in logic, in
   knowledge representation and reasoning, and in artificial intelligence
   are located at the second level of the Polynomial Hierarchy or even
   higher, and hence for these problems polynomial-time transformations to
   SAT are not possible, unless the hierarchy collapses. Recent research
   shows that in certain cases one can break through these complexity
   barriers by fixed-parameter tractable (fpt) reductions to SAT which
   exploit structural aspects of problem instances in terms of problem
   parameters. These reductions are more powerful because their running
   times can grow superpolynomially in the problem parameters. In this
   paper we develop a general theoretical framework that supports the
   classification of parameterized problems on whether they admit such an
   fpt-reduction to SAT or not. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {{We study the Bipartite Boolean Quadratic Programming Problem (BBQP)
   which is an extension of the well known Boolean Quadratic Programming
   Problem (BQP). Applications of the BBQP include mining discrete patterns
   from binary data, approximating matrices by rank-one binary matrices,
   computing the cut-norm of a matrix, and solving optimisation problems
   such as maximum weight biclique, bipartite maximum weight cut, maximum
   weight induced sub-graph of a bipartite graph, etc. For the BBQP, we
   first present several algorithmic components, specifically, hill
   climbers and mutations, and then show how to combine them in a
   high-performance metaheuristic. Instead of hand-tuning a standard
   metaheuristic to test the efficiency of the hybrid of the components, we
   chose to use an automated generation of a multi component metaheuristic
   to save human time, and also improve objectivity in the analysis and
   comparisons of components. For this we designed a new metaheuristic
   schema which we call Conditional Markov Chain Search (CMCS). We show
   that CMCS is flexible enough to model several standard metaheuristics;
   this flexibility is controlled by multiple numeric parameters, and so is
   convenient for automated generation. We study the configurations
   revealed by our approach and show that the best of them outperforms the
   previous state-of-the-art BBQP algorithm by several orders of magnitude.
   In our experiments we use benchmark instances introduced in the
   preliminary version of this paper and described here, which have already
   become the de facto standard in the BBQP literature. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) called DSScreening
   to rapidly detect inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) in newborn
   screening (NS). The system has been created using the Aide-DS framework,
   which uses techniques imported from model-driven software engineering
   (MDSE) and soft computing, and it is available through eGuider, a web
   portal for the enactment of computerised clinical practice guidelines
   and protocols.
   MDSE provides the context and techniques to build new software artefacts
   based on models which conform to a specific metamodel. It also offers
   separation of concern, to disassociate medical from technological
   knowledge, thus allowing changes in one domain without affecting the
   other. The changes might include, for instance, the addition of new
   disorders to the DSS or new measures to the computation related to a
   disorder. Artificial intelligence and soft computing provide fuzzy logic
   to manage uncertainty and ambiguous situations. Fuzzy logic is embedded
   in an inference system to build a fuzzy inference system (FIS);
   specifically, a single-input rule modules connected zero-order
   Takagi-Sugeno FIS. The automatic creation of FISs is performed by the
   Aide-DS framework, which is capable of embedding the generated FISs in
   computerized clinical guidelines. It can also create a desktop
   application to execute the FIS. Technologically, it supports the
   addition of new target languages for the desktop applications and the
   inclusion of new ways of acquiring data.
   DSScreening has been tested by comparing its predictions with the
   results of 152 real analyses from two groups: (1) NS samples and (2)
   clinical samples belonging to individuals of all ages with symptoms that
   do not necessarily correspond to an IEM. The system has reduced the time
   needed by 98.7\% when compared to the interpretation time spent by
   laboratory professionals. Besides, it has correctly classified 100\% of
   the NS samples and obtained an accuracy of 70\% for samples belonging to
   individuals with clinical symptoms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Wave parameter relationships have long been determined using methods
   that give non-standard and often inaccurate results. With increased
   commercial activity in the marine sector, the importance of accurate
   wave parameter relationship determination has become increasingly
   apparent. The outputs of many numerical models and buoy datasets do not
   include all requisite wave parameters, and a typical approach is to use
   a constant conversion factor or relationship based on defined spectra
   such as the Bretschneider or the joint North Sea wave observation
   project (JONSWAP) spectrum to determine these parameters. Given that
   relationships between wave parameters vary significantly over both
   hourly and seasonal and annual timescales, the currently employed
   methods are lacking, as subtleties are missed by the simpler approach.
   This paper addresses the determination of wave parameter relationships
   using a machine learning (ML)-based model, identifying and selecting the
   optimal method for the conversion of wave parameters (T-e, T-01) in
   coastal Irish Waters. This approach is then validated at two sites on
   the West coast of Ireland. The aim is to highlight the utility of ML in
   approximating the relationship between wave parameters; using both buoy
   and modelled data, and mapping the predicted outcomes for a wave energy
   converter based on a variety of ML and measure correlate predict
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{An nDT torus is a topology where each node comprises 2 identical
   (n+1)-port communication cards interconnected by 1 port. By using the
   current switches or communication cards, this node architecture allows
   to build torus networks having a greater number of dimensions than
   networks including only 1 card per node. There are multiple ways to use
   the ports of the 2 cards to connect a node to other nodes on the nDT
   torus, and therefore, checking all the configurations is only an
   affordable problem for small values of n. In this paper, we use
   artificial intelligence and data mining techniques to obtain the optimal
   port configuration of all the nodes in the network. We include a
   performance evaluation that shows nDT torus effectively increases the
   performance compared with the equivalent torus in resources, with
   synthetic and application trace-based workloads. We also apply these
   techniques to 3DT and 5DT tori to confirm the increase in the number of
   dimensions that does not affect to performance of the nDT torus.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the application of multiple linear regression (MLR)
   and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques for developing the models
   to predict the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and Brazilian
   tensile strength (BTS) of the fiber reinforced cement stabilized fly ash
   mixes. UCS and BTS is a highly nonlinear function of its constituents,
   thereby, making its modeling and prediction a difficult task. To
   establish relationship between the independent and dependent variables,
   a computational technique like ANN is employed which provides an
   efficient and easy approach to model the complex and nonlinear
   relationship. The data generated in the laboratory through systematic
   experimental programme for evaluating UCS and BTS of fiber reinforced
   cement fly ash mixes with respect to 7, 14 and 28 days. curing is used
   for development of the MLR and ANN model. The data used in the models is
   arranged in the format of four input parameters that cover the contents
   of cement and fibers along with maximum dry density (MDD) and optimum
   moisture contents (OMC), respectively and one dependent variable as
   unconfined compressive as well as Brazilian tensile strength. ANN models
   are trained and tested for various combinations of input and output data
   sets. Performance of networks is checked with the statistical error
   criteria of correlation coefficient (R), mean square error (MSE) and
   mean absolute error (MAE). It is observed that the ANN model predicts
   both, the unconfined compressive and Brazilian tensile, strength quite
   well in the form of R, RMSE and MAE. This study shows that as an
   alternative to classical modeling techniques, ANN approach can be used
   accurately for predicting the unconfined compressive strength and
   Brazilian tensile strength of fiber reinforced cement stabilized fly ash
   mixes.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{This research considers the problem of generating compact vector
   representations of physical design patterns for analytics purposes in
   semiconductor patterning domain. PatterNet uses a deep artificial neural
   network to learn mapping of physical design patterns to a compact
   Euclidean hyperspace. Distances among mapped patterns in this space
   correspond to dissimilarities among patterns defined at the time of the
   network training. Once the mapping network has been trained, PatterNet
   embeddings can be used as feature vectors with standard machine learning
   algorithms, and pattern search, comparison, and clustering become
   trivial problems. PatterNet is inspired by the concepts developed within
   the framework of generative adversarial networks as well as the FaceNet.
   Our method facilitates a deep neural network (DNN) to learn directly the
   compact representation by supplying it with pairs of design patterns and
   dissimilarity among these patterns defined by a user. In the simplest
   case, the dissimilarity is represented by an area of the XOR of two
   patterns. Important to realize that our PatterNet approach is very
   different to the methods developed for deep learning on image data. In
   contrast to ``conventional{''} pictures, the patterns in the CAD world
   are the lists of polygon vertex coordinates. The method solely relies on
   the promise of deep learning to discover internal structure of the
   incoming data and learn its hierarchical representations. Artificial
   intelligence arising from the combination of PatterNet and clustering
   analysis very precisely follows intuition of patterning/optical
   proximity correction experts paving the way toward human-like and
   human-friendly engineering tools. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of an artificial neural network (ANN)
   based intelligent pressure sensor to measure pressure in the range 0-100
   psig with high accuracy and temperature compensation. A capacitive
   pressure sensor detects the applied pressure by means of elastic
   deflection of diaphragm. A Modified Schering Bridge Signal Conditioning
   Circuit (MSB-SCC) converts the change in capacitance of the sensor into
   an equivalent voltage. The effect of change in environmental conditions,
   especially effect of ambient temperature on the pressure sensor and
   component drifts, stray effects associated with MSB-SCC introduce
   nonlinearity and cross-sensitivity errors in the output readout. The ANN
   trained with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm incorporates the
   intelligence into sensor signal conditioning circuit through a
   microcontroller unit to reduce the nonlinearity effects and compensate
   the cross-sensitivity errors. The LM algorithm shows better performance
   in terms of the linearity error in comparison with
   Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) and the Scaled Conjugate
   Gradient (SCG) algorithms. The proposed method is experimentally
   verified at various temperatures and it provides voltage readout within

Abstract = {{Forgetting is an oft-forgotten art. Many artificial intelligence (AI)
   systems deliver good performance when first implemented; however, as the
   contextual environment changes, they become out of date and their
   performance degrades. Learning new knowledge is part of the solution,
   but forgetting outdated facts and information is a vital part of the
   process of renewal. However, forgetting proves to be a surprisingly
   difficult concept to either understand or implement. Much of AI is based
   on analogies with natural systems, and although all of us have plenty of
   experiences with having forgotten something, as yet we have only an
   incomplete picture of how this process occurs in the brain. A recent
   judgment by the European Court concerns the ``right to be forgotten{''}
   by web index services such as Google. This has made debate and research
   into the concept of forgetting very urgent. Given the rapid growth in
   requests for pages to be forgotten, it is clear that the process will
   have to be automated and that intelligent systems of forgetting are
   required in order to meet this challenge.}},

Abstract = {{The research community has considered in the past the application of
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to control and operate networks.
   A notable example is the Knowledge Plane proposed by D.Clark et al.
   However, such techniques have not been extensively prototyped or
   deployed in the field yet. In this paper, we explore the reasons for the
   lack of adoption and posit that the rise of two recent paradigms:
   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Analytics (NA), will
   facilitate the adoption of AI techniques in the context of network
   operation and control. We describe a new paradigm that accommodates and
   exploits SDN, NA and AI, and provide use-cases that illustrate its
   applicability and benefits. We also present simple experimental results
   that support, for some relevant use-cases, its feasibility. We refer to
   this new paradigm as Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN).}},

Abstract = {{The inherent nature of energy, i.e., physicality, sociality and
   informatization, implies the inevitable and intensive interaction
   between energy systems and social systems. From this perspective, we
   define ``social energy{''} as a complex sociotechnical system of energy
   systems, social systems and the derived artificial virtual systems which
   characterize the intense inter-system and intra-system interactions. The
   recent advancement in intelligent technology, including artificial
   intelligence and machine learning technologies, sensing and
   communication in Internet of Things technologies, and massive high
   performance computing and extreme-scale data analytics technologies,
   enables the possibility of substantial advancement in socio-technical
   system optimization, scheduling, control and management. In this paper,
   we provide a discussion on the nature of energy, and then propose the
   concept and intention of social energy systems for electrical power. A
   general methodology of establishing and investigating social energy is
   proposed, which is based on the ACP approach, i.e., ``artificial
   systems{''} (A), ``computational experiments{''} (C) and ``parallel
   execution{''} (P), and parallel system methodology. A case study on the
   University of Denver (DU) campus grid is provided and studied to
   demonstrate the social energy concept. In the concluding remarks, we
   discuss the technical pathway, in both social and nature sciences, to
   social energy, and our vision on its future.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors introduce MIPSfpga and its accompanying set
   of learning materials. MIPSfpga is a teaching infrastructure that offers
   access to the non-obfuscated Register-Transfer Level (RTL) source code
   of the MIPS microAptiv UP processor. The core is made available by
   Imagination Technologies for academic use and is targeted to a
   field-programmable gate array (FPGA), making it ideal for both the
   classroom and research. The supporting materials and labs focus on
   hands-on learning that emphasises computer architecture, system on chip
   (SoC) design and hardware-software codesign. Among other things,
   students learn to set up the MIPS soft-core processor on an FPGA, run
   and debug programs on the core in simulation and in hardware, add new
   peripherals to the system, understand the microarchitecture and extend
   it to support new features, experiment with different cache sizes and
   content management policies, add new instructions using the CorExtend
   interface available in MIPS processors, and understand SoCs in embedded
   systems and how they are designed and built up in layers to run complex

Abstract = {{Classification techniques development constitutes a foundation for
   machine learning evolution, which has become a major part of the current
   mainstream of Artificial Intelligence research lines. However, the
   computational cost associated with these techniques limits their use in
   resource constrained embedded platforms. As the classification task is
   often combined with other high computational cost functions, efficient
   performance of the main modules is fundamental requirements to achieve
   hard real-time speed for the whole system. Graph-based machine learning
   techniques offer a powerful framework for building classifiers.
   Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) is a graph-based classifier presenting the
   interesting ability to provide nonlinear classes separation surfaces.
   This work proposes a SoC/FPGA based design and implementation of an
   architecture for embedded applications, presenting a hardware converted
   algorithm for an OPF classifier. Comparison of the achieved results with
   an embedded processor software implementation shows accelerations of the
   OPF classification from 2.18 to 9 times, which permits to expect
   real-time performance to embedded applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Recently; medical image mining has become one of the well-recognized
   research area(s) of machine learning and artificial intelligence
   techniques have been vastly used in various computer added diagnostic
   systems. Specifically; breast cancer classification problem is
   considered as one of the most significant problems. For instance,
   complex, diverse and heterogamous malignant features of
   micro-calcification in DICOM (Digital Communication in Medicine) images
   of mammography are very difficult to classify because the persistence of
   noise in mammogram images creates lots of confusions for doctors. In
   order to reduce the chances of misdiagnosis and to discernment the
   difference between malignant and benign lesions of micro-calcification
   this paper proposes a system so called ``Intelligent System For
   Detection of Micro-Calcification in Breast Cancer{''} by considering all
   above stated problems. Overall our system comprises over three main
   stages. In first stage, adaptive threshold algorithm is used to reduce
   the noise, and canny edge detection algorithm is used to detect the
   edges of every macro or micro classification. In second stage, deginated
   as feature selection is done by using auto-crop algorithm, which crops
   all types of calcifications and lesions by proposed algorithm so called
   CFEDNN (Calcification Feature Extraction Deep Neural Networks) which is
   designed to avoid the manual ROIs (Region of Interest). Decision model
   is constructed by using DNN (Deep Neural Networks) and the best
   classification accuracy is measured as 95.6\%.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial intelligence (Al) technology applied to product design in
   Monozukuri (Japanese way of manufacturing) aims to provide computerized
   support to various tasks in developing products that currently rely on
   human experience. As the conventional approach, in which knowledge and
   rules are explicitly given, has its limit, new technologies based on
   machine learning have been recognized as important in research and
   development of Al. Applying machine learning that predicts data to be
   acquired in the future with a certain accuracy, we can obtain efficient
   and less -variable judgment and eliminate conventional work depended on
   personal knowledge or experience. In order to apply Al technology to a
   product development environment, MONOZUKURI Al framework was developed
   on the cloud as a system to facilitate efficient collection of product
   development data, and, at the same time, for managing and leveraging
   learning models extracted from such data. By connecting this framework
   with Flexible Technical Computing Platform (FTCP), Fujitsu's integrated
   development platform, this new design development environment will
   provide various design tools on a platform with new, enhanced
   design-assisting features. This paper describes various cases in which
   machine learning is applied to designing, and presents our plan to
   introduce it into an integrated development platform.}},

Abstract = {{Fujitsu strives to offer ``smart Monozukuri{''} services that help to
   achieve efficient quality and product management applying information
   and communications technology (ICT) to Monozukuri (Japanese way of
   manufacturing). One of the systems being developed as part of this is
   Monozukuri Navigation System, based on technology to realize
   virtualization/integration at manufacturing sites. The system allows the
   users to fully leverage sensing technology, analytical tools, artificial
   intelligence (Al), and other ICT from the upstream of product
   development, helping them to utilize all production-related data, and it
   offers solutions that best suit the requirements for a particular
   production site. It is important for manufacturing practice to
   incorporate data regarding design assets, experience amount and
   capabilities of the production site, and operational status of the
   production facilities, as required, at the development and manufacturing
   sites and to develop the product to achieve an appropriate quality
   level. We focus on developing a system that reviews in-house practices
   and creates data relating to the conditions specific to the production
   site. The system analyzes them and provides a basis for models that
   predict manufacturing status, which are then used to optimize the site's
   manufacturing conditions. This paper outlines Monozukuri Navigation
   System, and explains its features. The paper also presents the real-time
   navigation, which is designed to prompt people to make the best plans
   based on comparisons between actual and predicted operational statuses.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, cloud-based services are widely developed. The deployment of
   cloud technology has boosted the development and application of web
   services. It reduces the overhead of software virtual machine, and
   supports a wider range of operating systems. Moreover, it enhances the
   utilization of infrastructure. With the development of artificial
   intelligence (AI) technology, especially artificial neural network
   (ANN), intelligent monitor systems are being raised and developed in our
   daily life. However, a simple task with a single ANN costs a lot of time
   and computation resources. Hence, we propose using a cloud-based system
   to share computation resources for ANN to reduce redundant computation.
   In this paper, we present an intelligent monitor system, which is based
   on cloud technology, to provide intelligent monitor services. The system
   is designed with hybrid convolutional neural networks. It has been used
   for several intelligent monitor tasks, such as scene change detection,
   stranger recognition, facial expression recognition and action

Abstract = {{To accomplish more ambitious scientific goals of interplanetary
   nanosatellite missions, a certain set of technological challenges need
   to be addressed to enhance systems performance. An area of, particular
   interest is mission autonomy. Increasing the degree of mission autonomy
   might help overcoming the limitations imposed by the typical low data
   rate and the simplified ground segment of small missions. This research
   aims at supporting the development of more autonomous spacecraft by
   exploiting the potentialities of artificial intelligence. An artificial
   neural network is proposed to enable a set of autonomous operations, for
   example to select what payload data are useful for the mission and must
   be sent to Earth, and what data can be discarded. The algorithm is
   developed and tested on a case study represented by a CubeSat mission to
   a near Earth asteroid that requires the autonomous detection of an
   impact event on the asteroid surface. The proposed algorithm
   demonstrates the feasibility of a novel training approach based on
   optimized datasets created directly in-situ using images taken by the
   spacecraft on-board camera. The validity of the algorithm is
   demonstrated through several simulations, considering different
   scenarios and disturbances. The research presented in this paper can be
   extended to other applications of the artificial neural networks, such
   as autonomous failure detection and isolation, also in conjunction with
   other artificial intelligence approaches. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{An Online Vehicle Routing Problem is a formation of Capacitated Vehicle
   Routing Problem with rerouting strategy to resolve the problem of
   inefficient vehicle routing caused by traffic congestion. A flexible
   delivery rerouting strategy is proposed, which aims at reducing the risk
   of late delivery. The method of terminating an exploration in a solution
   by the original ABC algorithm, when the solution is trapped in local
   optima, is to abandon the solution after specific tolerance limits are
   set. The phenomenon of local optimal traps will be repeated rapidly
   after a lengthy recursive process and will eventually result in a low
   quality solution, with a more complex combinatorial problem when the
   capability of the exploration is restricted by an inflexible termination
   criterion. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel scheme using a
   Multiple Colonies Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. The designs of the
   outstanding bee selection for colony communication show it to be
   superior in exploitation. The performance of the proposed algorithm is
   examined through by Capacitated Vehicle Routing instances and a case
   study, and the results indicate the potential of using real time
   information for data-driven vehicle scheduling. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the endemic problem of the gap between predicted
   and actual energy performance in public buildings. A system engineering
   approach is used to characterize energy performance factoring in
   building intrinsic properties, occupancy patterns, environmental
   conditions, as well as available control variables and their respective
   ranges. Due to the lack of historical data, a theoretical simulation
   model is considered. A semantic mapping process is proposed using
   principle component analysis (PCA) and multi regression analysis (MRA)
   to determine the governing (i.e., most sensitive) variables to reduce
   the energy gap with a (near) real-time capability. Further, an
   artificial neural network (ANN) is developed to learn the patterns of
   this semantic mapping, and is used as the cost function of a genetic
   algorithm (GA)-based optimization tool to generate optimized energy
   saving rules factoring in multiple objectives and constraints. Finally,
   a novel rule evaluation process is developed to evaluate the generated
   energy saving rules, their boundaries, and underpinning variables. The
   proposed solution has been tested on both a simulation platform and a
   pilot building - a care home in the Netherlands. Validation results
   suggest an average 25\% energy reduction while meeting occupants'
   comfort conditions.
   Note to Practioners-This study presents a novel semantic rule generation
   process using GA and ANN with the objective to reduce the gap between
   predicted and actual energy consumption in public buildings. Due to the
   absence of historical energy consumption data, a theoretical simulation
   approach is used that takes into account a wide range of factors,
   including building fabric, occupancy patterns, and environmental
   conditions. Energy sensitive variables are then identified using PCA and
   MRA. These sensitive variables as well as available control variables
   (set points) are used to train an ANN to learn energy consumption
   patterns and behavior within the considered buildings. This trained
   network is then used as a cost function engine (predictor) for a
   GA-based optimization process to generate the optimized energy saving
   rules. Finally, a novel rule evaluation process is devised and
   implemented to assess energy saving rules quality and boundaries. All
   generated rules have been tested on both the proposed simulation
   environment and real buildings. Validation results suggest an average
   25\% energy reduction.}},

Abstract = {{The use of artificial neural networks for parameter sensitivity analysis
   in civil engineering systems is an emerging research focus of increased
   interest. Existing methods are generally based on a single neural
   network, but are inadequate as a basis for parameter sensitivity
   analysis because of the instability of a single neural network. To
   address this deficiency, this study develops a neural network
   ensemble-based parameter sensitivity analysis paradigm. This paradigm
   features use of a set of preselected superior neural networks to make
   decisions about parameter sensitivity by synthesizing sensitivity
   analysis results of individual neural networks. The proposed paradigm is
   employed to address two classic civil engineering problems: (1)
   identification of critical parameters in the fracture failure of notched
   concrete beams and (2) recognition of the most significant parameters in
   the lateral deformation of deep foundation pits. The results show that
   tensile strength and modulus of elasticity are the critical parameters
   in the fracture failure of the notched concrete beam, and elasticity
   modulus of soil, Poisson's ratio and soil cohesion are the most
   significant influential factors in the lateral deformation of the deep
   foundation pit. The proposed method provides a common paradigm for
   analysing the sensitivity of influential parameters, shedding light on
   the underlying mechanisms of civil engineering systems.}},

Abstract = {{Waterflooding is a significantly important process in the life of an oil
   field to sweep previously unrecovered oil between injection and
   production wells and maintain reservoir pressure at levels above the
   bubble-point pressure to prevent gas evolution from the oil phase. This
   is a critical reservoir management practice for optimum recovery from
   oil reservoirs. Optimizing water injection volumes and optimizing well
   locations are both critical reservoir engineering problems to address
   since water injection capacities may be limited depending on the
   geographic location and facility limits. Characterization of the
   reservoir connectivity between injection and production wells can
   greatly contribute to the optimization process. In this study, it is
   proposed to use computationally efficient methods to have a better
   understanding of reservoir flow dynamics in a waterflooding operation by
   characterizing the reservoir connectivity between injection and
   production wells. First, as an important class of artificial
   intelligence methods, artificial neural networks are used as a fully
   data-driven modeling approach. As an additional powerful method that
   draws analogy between source/sink terms in oil reservoirs and electrical
   conductors, capacitance-resistance models are also used as a
   reduced-physics-driven modeling approach. After understanding each
   method's applicability to characterize the interwell connectivity, a
   comparative study is carried out to determine strengths and weaknesses
   of each approach in terms of accuracy, data requirements, expertise
   requirements, training algorithm and processing times.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic counting for moving crowds in digital images is an important
   application in computer artificial intelligence, especially for safety
   and management purposes. This paper presents a new method to estimate
   the size of a crowd. The new algorithm depends on sequential frame
   differences to estimate the crowd size in a scene. However, relying only
   on these simple differences adds more constraints for extracting
   sufficient crowd descriptors. A curvelet transform is employed to
   achieve that goal. Every two sequential frames are transformed into
   multi-resolution and multi-direction formats, and then the frame
   differences are detected at every subband in the curvelet domain.
   Statistical features out of each subband are then calculated, and the
   collected features from all subbands are considered as a descriptor
   vector for the crowd in the scene. Finally, a neural network is
   manipulated to map the descriptor vectors into predicted counts. The
   experimental results show that the proposed curvelet statistical
   features are more robust and provide crowd counting with higher accuracy
   than previous approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific partial discharge (PD) severity evaluation is highly
   important to the safe operation of gas-insulated switchgear. However,
   describing PD severity with only a few statistical features such as
   discharge time and discharge amplitude is unreliable. Hence, a
   deep-learning neural network model called stacked sparse auto-encoder
   (SSAE) is proposed to realise feature extraction from the middle layer
   with a small number of nodes. The output feature that is almost similar
   to the input PD information is produced in the model. The features
   extracted from PD data are then fed into a soft-max classifier to be
   classified into one of four defined PD severity states. In addition,
   unsupervised greedy layer-wise pre-training and supervised fine-tuning
   are utilised to train the SSAE network during evaluation. Results of
   testing and simulation analysis show that the features extracted by the
   SSAE model effectively characterise PD severity. The performance of the
   SSAE model, which possesses an average assessment accuracy of up to
   92.2\%, is better than that of the support vector machine algorithm
   based on statistical features. According to the tested number of SSAE
   layers and features and the training sample size, the SSAE model
   possesses good expansibility and can be useful in practical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{A novel framework is developed in this paper, to increase the real-time
   roadway traffic condition assessment accuracy, which integrates
   connected vehicle technology (CVT) with artificial intelligence (AI)
   paradigm forming a CVT-AI method. Traffic density is a major indicator
   of traffic conditions. In this paper, the traffic operational condition
   is assessed based on traffic density. A simulated network of Interstate
   26 in South Carolina is developed to investigate the effectiveness of
   the method. The assumption is that the vehicle onboard units will
   forward the CV generated data to the edge devices (e.g., roadside units)
   for further processing. CV generated distance headway and number of
   stops, and speed data are used to estimate traffic density. This paper
   reveals that, with 20\% and greater CV penetration levels, the accuracy
   of the density information with the AI-aided CVT is a minimum of 85\%.
   Moreover, this paper demonstrates that the integrated CVT-AI method
   yields a higher accuracy with the increase of CV penetration levels.
   Level of service (LOS) is the indicator of traffic congestion level on
   highways and is described with traffic density in terms of passenger
   car/mile/lane for a specific free flow speed. LOS estimated using the
   CVT-AI density estimation method is compared with the density estimation
   algorithm used by the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS),
   which relies on the occupancy and flow data collected by the freeway
   inductive loop detectors. With a 10\% or more CV penetration, higher
   accuracy is achieved using the CVT-AI algorithm compared with the PeMS
   density estimation algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Bus headway regularity heavily affects transit riders' attitude for
   choosing public transportation and also serves as an important indicator
   for transit performance evaluation. Therefore, an accurate estimate of
   bus headway can benefit both transit riders and transit operators. This
   paper proposed a relevance vector machine (RVM) algorithm to predict bus
   headway by incorporating the time series of bus headways, travel time,
   and passenger demand at previous stops. Different from traditional
   computational intelligence approaches, RVMcan output the probabilistic
   prediction result, in which the upper and lower bounds of a predicted
   headway within a certain probability are yielded. An empirical
   experiment with two bus routes in Beijing, China, is utilized to confirm
   the high precision and strong robustness of the proposed model. Five
   algorithms {[}support vector machine (SVM), genetic algorithm SVM,
   Kalman filter, k-nearest neighbor, and artificial neural network] are
   used for comparison with the RVM model and the result indicates that RVM
   outperforms these algorithms in terms of accuracy and confidence
   intervals. When the confidence level is set to 95\%, more than 95\% of
   actual bus headways fall within the prediction bands. With the
   probabilistic bus headway prediction information, transit riders can
   better schedule their trips to avoid late and early arrivals at bus
   stops, while transit operators can adopt the targeted correction actions
   to maintain regular headway for bus bunching prevention.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new method for real-time detection, motion estimation,
   and tracking of generic obstacles using just a 3-D point cloud and
   odometry information as input is presented. In this approach, a
   simplification of the world is done using voxels, supported by a
   particle filter-based 3-D object segmentation and a motion estimation
   scheme. That combination of techniques leverages a fast and reliable
   object detection, providing also motion speed and direction information.
   Four detailed studies have been performed in order to assess the
   suitability of the method, two of them related to the parameterization
   of the method and its input point cloud. Another one compares the
   tracking and detection results with other state-of-the-art methods. Last
   tests are intended for the characterization of the execution times
   required. Results are encouraging, with a high detection rate, low error
   rate, and real-time capable computing performance. In the attached

Title = {{What is answer set programming to propositional satisfiability}},

Abstract = {{Propositional satisfiability (or satisfiability) and answer set
   programming are two closely related subareas of Artificial Intelligence
   that are used to model and solve difficult combinatorial search
   problems. Satisfiability solvers and answer set solvers are the software
   systems that find satisfying interpretations and answer sets for given
   propositional formulas and logic programs, respectively. These systems
   are closely related in their common design patterns. In satisfiability,
   a propositional formula is used to encode problem specifications in a
   way that its satisfying interpretations correspond to the solutions of
   the problem. To find solutions to a problem it is then sufficient to use
   a satisfiability solver on a corresponding formula. Niemela, Marek, and
   TruszczyA{''}ski coined answer set programming paradigm in 1999: in this
   paradigm a logic program encodes problem specifications in a way that
   the answer sets of a logic program represent the solutions of the
   problem. As a result, to find solutions to a problem it is sufficient to
   use an answer set solver on a corresponding program. These parallels
   that we just draw between paradigms naturally bring up a question: what
   is a fundamental difference between the two? This paper takes a close
   look at this question.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to develop on-stream inspection (OSI)
   system for pitting corrosion defect for intelligent and safe
   manufacturing. During the tests of two pressure vessels, acoustic
   emission (AE) was utilized for on-line detection. Phase array ultrasonic
   inspection was also conducted in order to assess internal integrity of
   pressure vessels. Feature acquisition was utilized to obtain essential
   features from the experimental data. In order to obtain the optimal
   features effectively, Euclidean distance measure and sequential forward
   search algorithm (SFS) were utilized for choosing features. The chosen
   three features were AE time-domain kurtosis, AE duration, and AE
   frequency domain average. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems
   (ANFIS), which is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), were
   utilized. The chosen three features were the inputs to a 3{*}(3{*}3{*}3)
   ANFIS. Whether there is pitting corrosion defect or not was the output
   of this system. This approach can most quickly and most reliably
   determine whether there is a pitting corrosion defect or not for
   pressure vessels. With phase array ultrasonic system for on-line
   inspection, the most reliable and accurate verification of the OSI can
   be conducted. The developed intelligent on-line system has very high
   reliability and safety. This OSI system can reduce shut down inspection
   (SDI), increase automation, efficiency, and reduce cost for intelligent
   and safe manufacturing.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Computer aided design (CAD) plays a vital role in modern VLSI design.
   Electronic simulation is widely used to verify the design and test the
   behavior of the circuit before fabrication. One of the major research
   areas in CAD is circuit simulation. Circuit simulation is to use
   mathematical models to predict the behavior of an electronic circuit. A
   circuit is usually represented by a set of partial differential
   equations (PDEs) or ordinary differential equations (ODEs). So, the
   circuit simulation actually involves solving large-scale ODEs which
   sometimes takes several days or even weeks. Therefore, fast and accurate
   circuit simulation algorithms are needed to accelerate the simulation
   cycle. One way to speed up the simulation is to approximate the original
   system with an appropriately simplified system which captures the main
   properties of the original one. This method is called model order
   reduction (MOR), which reduces the complexity of the original large
   system and generates a reduced-order model (ROM) to represent the
   original one. There are many existing MOR methods, but there is no
   method that gives the best results for all of the systems. So, each
   system uses the best method according to its application. So, there is
   still a need for novel MOR techniques. This paper presents a novel MOR
   technique based on artificial intelligence.}},

Abstract = {{Fault location identification is an important task to provide reliable
   service to the customer. Most existing artificial intelligence methods
   such as neural network, fuzzy logic, and support vector machine (SVM)
   focus on identifying the fault type, section, and distance separately.
   Furthermore, studies on fault type identification are focused on
   overhead transmission systems and not on underground distribution
   systems. In this paper, a fault location method in the distribution
   system is proposed using SVM, addressing the limitations of existing
   methods. Support vector classification (SVC) and regression analysis are
   performed to locate the fault. The method uses the voltage sag data
   during a fault measured at the primary substation. The type of fault is
   identified using SVC. The fault resistance and the voltage sag for the
   estimated fault resistance are identified using support vector
   regression (SVR) analysis. The possible faulty sections are identified
   from the estimated voltage sag data and ranked using the Euclidean
   distance approach. The proposed method identifies the fault distance
   using SVR analysis. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed
   using Malaysian distribution system of 40 buses. Test results show that
   the proposed method gives reliable fault location. (C) 2017 Institute of

Abstract = {{In unstructured wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which consist of a
   dense collection of sensor nodes deployed randomly, the communication
   and processing capabilities of sensor nodes can be limited owing to
   their small embedded batteries and available bandwidth. Power management
   is therefore one of the most important issues to consider in the
   implementation of WSNs. As a result, decentralized detection, in which
   the fusion center makes the final decision to use data partially
   processed by local nodes, is more attractive than centralized detection
   in unstructured WSNs. This paper proposes a more efficient and effective
   method for solving the power allocation problem as a constrained
   optimization problem: to schedule power allocation in a distributed WSN
   using correlated observations and amplify-and-forward local processing
   at sensor nodes so that the WSN detects a constant signal while
   maintaining a sufficient fusion error probability threshold. To
   accomplish this goal, this paper proposes using Deb's method, which does
   not require a penalty parameter when handling the constraints of the
   optimization problem. Additionally, representative optimization
   algorithms based on swarm intelligence are used, i.e., particle swarm
   optimization, ant colony optimization for continuous domains (), and
   artificial bee colony. Through a simulation, their performance is
   compared for several different WSNs to determine the best algorithm for
   solving the power allocation problem.}},

Abstract = {{Entity matching is to map the records in a database to their
   corresponding entities. It is a well-known problem in the field of
   database and artificial intelligence. In digital libraries such as DBLP,
   ArnetMiner, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, AllMusic, IMDB,
   etc., some of the attributes may evolve over time, i.e., they change
   their values at different instants of time. For example, affiliation and
   email-id of an author in bibliographic databases which maintain
   publication details of various authors like DBLP, ArnetMiner, etc. may
   change their values. A taxpayer can change his or her address over time.
   Sometimes people change their surnames due to marriage. When a database
   contains records of these natures and the number of records grows beyond
   a limit, then it becomes really challenging to identify which records
   belong to which entity due to the lack of a proper key. In the current
   paper, the problem of automatic partitioning of records is posed as an
   optimization problem. Thereafter, a genetic algorithm based automatic
   technique is proposed to solve the entity matching problem. The proposed
   approach is able to automatically determine the number of partitions
   available in a bibliographic dataset. A comparative analysis with the
   two existing systems - DBLP and ArnetMiner, over sixteen bibliographic
   datasets proves the efficacy of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{An information system is an important model in the field of artificial
   intelligence. A distributed fc-decision information system is an
   information system with distributed fuzzy data. This paper investigates
   a distributed fc-decision information system, proposes a
   multi-granulation decision-theoretic method for this system and gives an
   application in medical diagnosis. The fuzzy T-cos-equivalence relation,
   induced by an fc-decision information system by means of Gaussian kernel
   method, is first obtained, where Gaussian kernel is used to compute the
   similarity between objects in this system. Then, the approximately equal
   relation (for short, ae-relation) on fuzzy sets is defined and based on
   this ae-relation, the ae-granular structure induced by the fuzzy
   Tcos-equivalence relation is given. Next, a multi-granulation
   decision-theoretic rough set method for distributed fc-decision
   information systems is proposed by means of inclusion degree of sets in
   the viewpoint of multi-granulation. Finally, an example of medical
   diagnosis is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   method. These results will be helpful for dealing with distributed fuzzy
   data and significant for establishing a framework of multi-granulation
   decision-theoretic rough sets in distributed fc-decision information

Abstract = {{Carrying out self-diagnosis of telecommunication networks requires an
   understanding of the phenomenon of fault propagation on these networks.
   This understanding makes it possible to acquire relevant knowledge in
   order to automatically solve the problem of reverse fault propagation.
   Two main types of methods can be used to understand fault propagation in
   order to guess or approximate as much as possible the root causes of
   observed alarms. Expert systems formulate laws or rules that best
   describe the phenomenon. Artificial intelligence methods consider that a
   phenomenon is understood if it can be reproduced by modeling. We propose
   in this paper, a generic probabilistic modeling method which facilitates
   fault propagation modeling on large-scale telecommunication networks. A
   Bayesian network (BN) model of fault propagation on gigabit-capable
   passive optical network-fiber to the home (GPON-FTTH) access network is
   designed according to the generic model. GPON-FTTH network skills are
   used to build structure and approximatively determine parameters of the
   BN model so-called expert BN model of the GPON-FTTH network. This BN
   model is confronted with reality by carrying out self-diagnosis of real
   malfunctions encountered on a commercial GPON-FTTH network. Obtained
   self-diagnosis results are very satisfying and we show how and why these
   results of the probabilistic model are more consistent with the
   behaviour of the GPON-FTTH network, and more reasonable on a
   representative sample of diagnosis cases, than a rule-based expert
   system. With the main goal to improve diagnostic performances of the BN
   model, we study and apply expectation maximization algorithm in order to
   automatically fine-tune parameters of the BN model from real data
   generated by a commercial GPON-FTTH network. We show that the new BN
   model with optimized parameters reasonably improves self-diagnosis
   previously carried out by the expert Bayesian network model of the
   GPON-FTTH access network.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A known limitation of many diagnosis algorithms is that the number of
   diagnoses they return can be very large. This is both time consuming and
   not very helpful from the perspective of a human operator: presenting
   hundreds of diagnoses to a human operator (charged with repairing the
   system) is meaningless. In various settings, including decision support
   for a human operator and automated troubleshooting processes, it is
   sufficient to be able to answer a basic diagnostic question: is a given
   component faulty? We propose a way to aggregate an arbitrarily large set
   of diagnoses to return an estimate of the likelihood of a given
   component to be faulty. The resulting mapping of components to their
   likelihood of being faulty is called the system's health state. We
   propose two metrics for evaluating the accuracy of a health state and
   show that an accurate health state can be found without finding all
   diagnoses. An empirical study explores the question of how many
   diagnoses are needed to obtain an accurate enough health state, and an
   online stopping criteria is proposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   arbitrary point sets}},
Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{139-148}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The Hausdorff Distance (HD) is a very important similarity measurement
   in Pattern Recognition, Shape Matching and Artificial Intelligence.
   Because of its inherent computational complexity, computing the HD using
   the NAIVEHD (brute force) algorithm is difficult, especially for
   comparing the similarity between large scale point sets in the time of
   big data. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel, efficient and
   general algorithm for computing the exact HD for arbitrary point sets,
   which takes advantage of the spatial locality of point sets, namely,
   Local Start Search (LSS). Different from the state-of-the-art algorithm
   EARLYBREAK in PAMI 2015, our idea comes from the observation and fact
   that the neighbor points of a break position in the current loop have
   higher probability to break the next loop than other points. Therefore,
   in our algorithm, we add a new mechanism to record the current break
   position as a start position, which is initialized as search center of
   the next loop. Then, LSS executes the next loop by scanning the neighbor
   points around the center. In this way, LSS maintains high performance in
   both overlap and non-overlap situations. Furthermore, the LSS algorithm
   can process arbitrary data by adopting the Morton Curve to establish the
   order of scattered point sets, while the EARLYBREAK is mainly applied to
   regular data which require the same grid size, such as medical images or
   voxel data. In the non-overlapping situation when comparing pairs of
   arbitrary point sets, LSS achieves performance as good as EARLYBREAK
   algorithm. While in the overlapping situation when comparing pairs of
   arbitrary point sets, LSS is faster than EARLYBREAK by three orders of
   magnitude. Thus, as a whole, LSS outperforms EARLYBREAK. In addition,
   LSS compared against the increment hausdorff distance calculation
   algorithm (INC) and significantly outperforms it by an order of
   magnitude faster. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of
   the proposed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Memristor, as the future of artificial intelligence, has been widely

   memristor-based Cohen-Grossberg neural networks (MCGNNs) is studied. The
   neural network (NN) considered in this paper is based on the memristor
   and involves time-varying delays, distributed delays and impulsive
   effects. The boundedness and monotonicity of the activation function are
   not assumed. By some inequality technique and contraction mapping

Abstract = {{Different machines are used in the production of electronic boards to
   control the elements, the correct amounts and their directions. The
   automated optical inspection systems are used to solve the excessive
   complexity of printed circuit boards and increase the production with
   high accuracy as well as low errors. In cases where the quick inspection
   of the board is impossible, the inspection is done visually with eyes.
   Since, the eyes get tired of continuous work, automating this process
   increases the production and quality of products. Therefore, a lot of
   visual devices are presented in the industry. The automated optical
   inspection systems can be used at any stage of production. AOI is one of
   these systems. In this technique, AOI machine is able to get a picture
   of the board. The automated optical inspection system uses the
   registered image to compare the information of images with the
   information of the machines to detect errors and make decisions. Using
   this comparison, the AOI system can detect and identify any error or
   suspicious area. In the present article, we have attempted to build an
   AOI device to cover all the errors happening in the printed circuit
   boards at any stage of the production line. The traveling salesman
   problem is solved to control the direction of movement of the camera on
   the conveyor. To introduce any printed circuit board to the system, a
   software is designed that uses CAD file to obtain the type of elements
   on the printed circuit board and their conditions, finds the optimal
   route for the movement of X-Y table, detects the errors arising from
   lack of elements, elements' directions, the connection of two bases, the
   lack of soldering, cold soldering, added soldering, etc. in three stages
   of feature extraction, feature selection and decision-making. The
   results show that the device is efficient in the detection of the glue
   error before mounting of the element and the detection of SMD and DIP
   elements after bath.}},

Abstract = {{Online output prediction is an indispensable part of any model
   predictive control implementation. For several application scenarios,
   operating conditions may change quite often, while designing the data
   collection process may not be an option. To this end, this study
   introduces a supervisory output prediction scheme, tailored specifically
   for input-output stable bilinear systems, that intends on automating the
   process of selecting the most appropriate prediction model during
   runtime. The selection process is based upon a reinforcement-learning
   scheme, where prediction models are selected according to their prior
   prediction performance. An additional selection process is concerned
   with appropriately partitioning the control-inputs' domain also to allow
   for switched-system approximations of the original bilinear dynamics.
   The authors show analytically that the proposed scheme converges (in
   probability) to the best model and partition. They also demonstrate
   these properties through simulations of temperature prediction in

Abstract = {{Accurate forecasting of electricity market prices presents important
   information to market participants. This provides forward planning of
   their bidding strategies in order to maximise revenue, profit, and
   utility perspectives. Nevertheless, due to the non-stationarities
   involved in market clearing price, an accurate forecasting of these
   prices is very complex. In this case, transformation from traditional
   point forecasts to probabilistic interval ones is of great importance to
   quantify the uncertainties of potential forecasts. In this study,
   interval forecasting of market clearing prices is conducted based on a
   novel approach within two consecutive steps. In the first step, a new
   hybrid method is proposed to estimate point forecasts: combination of
   wavelet transformation (Wt), feature selection based on Mutual
   Information (MI), extreme learning machine (ELM), and bootstrap
   approaches in an ensemble structure is employed. The second step
   consists of the following stepwise parts: calculating the variance of
   the model uncertainties based on the extracted data from the ensemble

Abstract = {{This study proposes an artificial emotional reinforcement learning (ERL)
   controller for automatic generation control (AGC) of large-scale
   interconnected power grids. In the scheme of ERL, the agent consists of
   two parts, a mechanical logical part and a humanistic emotional part,
   which essentially develop the control strategies of the agent. These two
   parts in proposed controller are introduced by reinforcement learning
   (RL) and artificial emotion (AE), respectively. The ERL controller can
   generate different control strategies depending on the operating
   scenarios, by highly integrating AE functions, which are quadratic
   function, exponential function, and linear function, respectively, with
   the elements of RL, such as action, learning rate, and reward function.
   The effectiveness of ERL controller with nine control strategies has
   been demonstrated considering AGC on a two-area load frequency control
   power system and China Southern Power Grid (CSG) power system. Results
   of simulation show the superior performance of ERL over that of
   proportional-integral control and four RL techniques.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide a Nearest Neighbour based extension for
   project control forecasting with Earned Value Management. The k-Nearest
   Neighbour method is employed as a predictor and to reduce the size of a
   training set containing more similar observations. An Artificial
   Intelligence (Al) method then makes use of the reduced training set to
   predict the real duration of a project. Additionally, we report on the
   forecasting stability of the various Al methods and their hybrid Nearest
   Neighbour counterparts. A large computer experiment is set up to assess
   the forecasting accuracy and stability of the existing and newly
   proposed methods. The experiments indicate that the Nearest Neighbour
   technique yields the best stability results and is able to improve the
   AI methods when the training set is similar or not equal to the test
   set. Sensitivity checks vary the amount of historical data and number of
   neighbours, leading to the conclusion that having more historical data,
   from which the a relevant subset can be selected by means of the
   proposed Nearest Neighbour technique, is preferential. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   for generating a policy and critic NN for evaluating the cost-to-go.
   Rigorous stability of the system has been proven via Lyapunov's direct

Abstract = {{Various artificial intelligence techniques are used in order to make
   prospective estimations with available data. The most common and applied
   method among these artificial intelligence techniques is Artificial
   Neural Networks (ANN). On the other hand, another method which is used
   in order to make prospective estimations with available data is Trend
   Analysis. When the relation of these two methods is analyzed, Artificial
   Neural Networks method can present the prospective estimation
   numerically, while there is no such a case in Trend Analysis. Trend
   Analysis method presents result of prospective estimation as a decrease
   or increase in data. Therefore, it is quite important to make a
   comparison between these methods which brings about prospective
   estimation with the available data, because these two methods are used
   in most of these studies. In this study, annual average stream flow and
   suspended load measured in Sakarya River along with average annual
   rainfall trend were analyzed with trend analysis method. Daily, weekly,
   and monthly average stream flows and suspended loads measured in Sakarya
   River and average daily, weekly, and monthly rainfall data of Sakarya

   inspired by biological social populations that individually react to
   environmental stimuli. Using a very simple protocol, it exhibits the
   desired emergent properties. When compared to a well established

   better throughput, end-to-end delay and fairness. This paper describes

Abstract = {{An enhanced scatter search (eSS) with combined opposition-based learning
   algorithm is proposed to solve large-scale parameter estimation in
   kinetic models of biochemical systems. The proposed algorithm is an
   extension of eSS with three important improvements in terms of:
   reference set (RefSet) formation, RefSet combination, and RefSet
   intensification. Due to the difficulty in estimating kinetic parameter
   values in the presence of noise and large number of parameters
   (high-dimension), the aforementioned eSS mechanisms have been improved
   using combination of quasi-opposition and quasi-reflection, which were
   under the family of opposition-based learning scheme. The proposed
   algorithm is tested using one set of benchmark function each from
   large-scale global optimization (LSGO) problem as well as parameter
   estimation problem. The LSGO problem consists of 11 functions with 1000
   dimensions. For parameter estimation, around 116 kinetic parameters in
   Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and central carbon metabolism of E.
   coil are estimated. The results revealed that the proposed algorithm is
   superior to eSS and other competitive algorithms in terms of its
   efficiency in minimizing objective function value and having faster
   convergence rate. The proposed algorithm also required lower
   computational resources, especially number of function evaluations
   performed and computation time. In addition, the estimated kinetic
   parameter values obtained from the proposed algorithm produced the best
   fit to a set of experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, due to significant developments in online shopping and
   the widespread use of e-commerce, competition among companies has
   increased considerably. As a result, product reviews have become a
   primary factor in consumers' decision making, which has given rise to a
   market for fraudulent reviews about real products and services. In this
   study, the authors propose a model using a multiple classifier system to
   identify deceptive negative customer reviews, which they validated with
   a dataset of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor. The proposed model used
   five classifiers by following the majority voting combination rule -
   namely, libLinear, libSVM, sequential minimal optimisation, random
   forest, and J48 - the first two of which represent different
   implementations of support vector machines. Ultimately, the model
   provided remarkable results that demonstrate improvement upon approaches
   reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Health care data diagnosis deals with a prediction of the course of a
   disease by analyzing the information in health care systems. Analyzing
   healthcare datasets is one of the major challenges of recent times.
   Associative Classification (AC) is one of the data mining techniques
   commonly used for disease diagnosis. AC integrates the concept of
   Association Rule Mining (ARM) and classification. Though, AC is an
   efficient classification system, it often experiences poor accuracy as
   it generates huge volume of class rules in the `rule generation' phase.
   This paper intends to address this issue by structuring an associative
   classifier using significant PARs (Predictive Association Rules) i.e.
   simply class rules. In this work, Firefly Algorithm (FA), a nature
   inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm is adopted to fit into the
   `rule generation' phase of existing CPAR (Classification based on
   Predictive Association Rule), an AC algorithm. This work acquires the
   essential inspiration of FA and CPAR to construct an associative
   classifier with significant PARs. FA with a customized fitness function
   specifically designed for the health care data diagnosis is proposed to
   find a small set of significant PARs. FA based Predictive Association
   Rule (FPAR) classifier thus built using significant PARs achieves high
   prognostic accurateness and interestingness value. Performance of FPAR
   and CPAR algorithms are analyzed over the six health care datasets from
   UCI machine learning repository. Based on the experiments, promising
   results in terms of classifier accuracy are provided by FPAR algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The paper proposes a new optimization algorithm that is extremely robust
   in solving mathematical and engineering problems. The algorithm combines
   the deterministic nature of classical methods of optimization and global
   converging characteristics of meta-heuristic algorithms. Common traits
   of nature-inspired algorithms like randomness and tuning parameters
   (other than population size) are eliminated. The proposed algorithm is
   tested with mathematical benchmark functions and compared to other
   popular optimization algorithms. The results show that the proposed
   algorithm is superior in terms of robustness and problem solving
   capabilities to other algorithms. The paradigm is also applied to an
   engineering problem to prove its practicality. It is applied to find the
   optimal location of multi-type FACTS devices in a power system and
   tested in the IEEE 39 bus system and UPSEB 75 bus system. Results show
   better performance over other standard algorithms in terms of voltage
   stability, real power loss and sizing and cost of FACTS devices.}},

Abstract = {{AI (Artificial Intelligence) is often looked at as a logical way to
   develop a game agent that methodically looks at options and delivers
   rational or irrational solutions. This paper is based on developing an
   AI agent that plays a game with a similar emotive content like a human.
   The purpose of the study was to see if the incorporation of this emotive
   content would influence the outcomes within the game Love Letter. In
   order to do this an AI agent with an emotive layer was developed to play
   the game over amillion times. A lower win/loss ratio demonstrates that,
   to some extent, this methodology was vindicated and a 100 per cent win
   for the AI agent did not happen. Machine learning techniques were
   modelled purposely so as to match extreme models of behavioural change.
   The results demonstrated a win/loss ratio of 0.67 for the AI agent and,
   in many ways, reflected the frustration that a normal player would
   exhibit during game play. As was hypothesised, the final agent
   investment value was, on average, lower after match play than its
   initial value.}},

Abstract = {{In a vehicular network where roadside units (RSUs) are deprived from a
   permanent grid-power connection, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)
   communications are disrupted once the RSU's battery is completely
   drained. These batteries are recharged regularly either by human
   intervention or using energy harvesting techniques, such as solar or
   wind energy. As such, it becomes particularly crucial to conserve
   battery power until the next recharge cycle in order to maintain network
   operation and connectivity. This paper examines a vehicular network
   whose RSU dispossesses a permanent power source but is instead equipped
   with a large battery, which is periodically recharged. In what follows,
   a reinforcement learning technique, i.e., protocol for energy-efficient
   adaptive scheduling using reinforcement learning (PEARL), is proposed
   for the purpose of optimizing the RSU's downlink traffic scheduling
   during a discharge period. PEARL's objective is to equip the RSU with
   the required artificial intelligence to realize and, hence, exploit an
   optimal scheduling policy that will guarantee the operation of the
   vehicular network during the discharge cycle while fulfilling the
   largest number of service requests. The simulation input parameters were
   chosen in a way that guarantees the convergence of PEARL, whose
   exploitation showed better results when compared with three heuristic
   benchmark scheduling algorithms in terms of a vehicle's quality of
   experience and the RSU's throughput. For instance, the deployment of the
   well-trained PEARL agent resulted in at least 50\% improved performance
   over the best heuristic algorithm in terms of the percentage of vehicles
   departing with incomplete service requests.}},

Abstract = {{Just recently, the concept of augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) over
   wireless has taken the entire 5G ecosystem by storm, spurring an
   unprecedented interest from academia, industry, and others. However, the
   success of an immersive VR experience hinges on solving a plethora of
   grand challenges cutting across multiple disciplines. This article
   underscores the importance of VR technology as a disruptive use case of
   5G (and beyond) harnessing the latest development of storage/memory,
   fog/edge computing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and
   others. In particular, the main requirements of wireless interconnected
   VR are described followed by a selection of key enablers; then research
   avenues and their underlying grand challenges are presented.
   Furthermore, we examine three VR case studies and provide numerical
   results under various storage, computing, and network configurations.
   Finally, this article exposes the limitations of current networks and
   makes the case for more theory, and innovations to spearhead VR for the
   masses.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach for the generation of an aircraft
   intent that unambiguously describes the behavior of the aircraft during
   a flight. This behavior is the result of modeling the piloting
   strategies used by an automation system, such as a flight management
   system or a pilot, to comply with the set of prescribed constraints
   included in a flight plan or an aircraft mission description. The
   corresponding four-dimensional trajectory can be later computed from
   this aircraft intent. Special focus is given to the generation of
   vertical profiles. This approach is inspired by search strategies used
   in artificial intelligence: a search tree is generated to evaluate
   possible maneuvers at each point; and microstrategies are used to build
   this tree and decide what maneuvers might be possible. It will be shown
   that this process is flexible enough to meet the needs of many
   applications of trajectory prediction. Specifically, its modular design
   allows changing elements of the intent generation process to fit very
   different scenarios, from commercial airliner flights to unmanned
   aircraft flights.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the experimental thermal and hydraulic
   performances of heat sinks with various channel diameter for cooling
   electronic components. A heat sink with the length and width of 60 mm
   and total height of 16 mm fabricated from aluminum material. The heat
   sink is designed with four circular minichannels and three different
   values of hydraulic diameter of channel (D = 4 mm, D = 6 mm and D = 8
   mm). The minichannel heat sink is heated with a uniform base heat flux.
   Also, numerical simulation of the problem is performed using Finite
   Volume Method (FVM). Comparing the experimental and numerical results
   show that numerical results are in a good agreement with experimental
   data. The variation of channel diameter affects the heat transfer and
   pressure drop characteristics of the circular shaped minichannel heat
   sink. The experimental results show that the increase of channel
   diameter reduces the pressure drop in the heat sink. Also, the
   minichannel heat sink with a hydraulic diameter of 4 mm has a much lower
   thermal resistance than the minichannel heat sinks with a hydraulic
   diameter of 6 mm and 8 mm. Furthermore, the optimization is done to have
   the maximum heat transfer coefficient and minimum of pressure drop along
   the heat sink. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive communication model perform the investigation and surveillance

   wireless channel handover strategy in cognitive computing systems, new
   computing models are desired in operating set of tasks to process
   business model, and interact naturally with humans or machine rather
   being programmed. Cognitive wireless network are trained via artificial
   intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for dynamic
   processing of spectrum handovers. They assist human experts in making
   enhanced decisions by penetrating into the complexity of the handovers.
   This paper focuses on learning and reasoning features of cognitive radio
   (CR) by analyzing primary user (PU) and secondary user (SU) data
   communication using home location register (HLR) and visitor location
   register (VLR) database respectively. The SpecPSO is proposed for
   optimizing handovers using supervised machine learning technique for
   performing dynamic handover by adapting to the environment and make

Abstract = {{Computational intelligence based forecasting approaches proved to be

   to identify the computational intelligence model that is more proper to

   the study presented in {[}27](a), in this paper we first perform a
   comparative study between the most accurate computational intelligence
   models that were used for particulate matter (fraction PM2.5) air
   pollution forecasting: artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive
   neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Based on the obtained experimental
   results, we make a comprehensive analysis of best ANN architecture
   identification. The experiments were realized on datasets from the
   AirBase databases with PM2.5 concentration hourly measurements. The
   statistical parameters that were computed are mean absolute error, root
   mean square error, index of agreement and correlation coefficient.}},

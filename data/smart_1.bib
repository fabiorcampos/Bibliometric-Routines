Abstract = {{This paper discusses the use of stream reasoning models and techniques
   to provide a stream reasoning-based architecture to represent, manage
   and process data streams produced in the Smart City context, to extract
   useful knowledge for a better understanding of city phenomena and to
   support the decision making processes in both the city governance and
   the citizens. The proposed architecture, taking into account the need
   for processing heterogeneous data/information across several and
   different domains, is able to sustain decision-making processes deployed
   at operational, tactical and strategical levels. Such architecture is
   distributed and adopts a meet-in-the-middle configuration logic that is
   really effective and scalable in a complex environment like a (smart)
   city. The applicability of semantic technologies to implement all the
   aforementioned features is demonstrated by means of a complex case study
   realized by using a dataset, related to the city of Aarhus, provided by
   the CityPulse EU Project.}},

Abstract = {{In smart city, accurate video sensing information is very critical for
   the whole city system. However, huge amount of information is the main
   characteristic of multi-camera system, and we have truly been in big
   data era for image/video processing. In the development of modern smart
   city, how to make accurate image retrieval in multi-camera system should
   be considered seriously. In previous researches, many approaches have
   been put forward. To the best of our knowledge, there is few research
   focusing on the method based on distributed fault-tolerant processing
   (DFP) method. The introduction of DFP will greatly improve the
   processing rate based on cloud computing, so it will be beneficial to
   the improvement of this issue. In this paper, we propose a distributed
   image-retrieval method designed for cloud-computing based multi-camera
   system in smart city. Through the combination of the cloud storage
   technology, data encryption and data retrieval technology, we achieve
   efficient integration and management of multi camera resources. In this
   way, the cloud computing network data will be released more quickly,
   which can provide convenient storage service for users. What is more,
   experimental results show the scalability and effectiveness of the
   proposed method, compared with previous processing methods. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{An evolved grid system, Smart Grid, enables appropriate adjustments in
   the amount of electricity generation by providing the capability to
   monitor the consumption behavior of customers. This advance grid system
   can help to promote cultural heritage because it is responsible to
   provide un-interruptible and reliable power supply in smart way. Smart
   grid is one of the key component for enabling smart cities and
   obviously, any city with more smart amenities will ultimately attract
   visitors to come and visit rich heritage. In smart grid, Supervisory
   Control and Data Acquisition (SCDA) system is responsible for keeping
   the underlying communication secure between substations and
   corresponding control center. While communication between customers and
   substations needs more enhancements as the existing protocols do not
   meet the comprehensive security requirements of smart grid. Due to the
   complex nature of smart grid and diverse security requirements,
   designing a suitable authentication scheme is a challenging task. For
   delay sensitive networks like smart grid, an ideal authentication scheme
   should withstand against all known security attacks, involving
   lightweight operations with trivial computations. ECC provides same
   security level with much less key sizes as compared with other security
   techniques such as RSA, DSA and DH. Keeping in mind the complex and
   delay sensitive nature of smart grid, a lightweight ECC based
   authentication scheme is proposed here. The proposed scheme not only
   provides mutual authentication with low computation and communication
   cost but also withstand against all known security attacks. (C) 2017

   cipher in VANETs}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{61}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{With the expansion of wireless technology, vehicular ad-hoc networks
   (VANETs) are emerging as a promising approach for realizing smart cities
   and addressing many serious traffic problems, such as road safety,
   convenience, and efficiency. To avoid any possible rancorous attacks,
   employing lightweight ciphers is most effective for implementing
   encryption/decryption, message authentication, and digital signatures
   for the security of the VANETs. Light encryption device (LED) is a
   lightweight block cipher with two basic keysize variants: LED-64 and
   LED-128. Since its inception, many fault analysis techniques have
   focused on provoking faults in the last four rounds to derive the 64-bit
   and 128-bit secret keys. It is vital to investigate whether injecting
   faults into a prior round enables breakage of the LED. This study
   presents a novel impossible meet-in-the-middle fault analysis on a prior
   round. A detailed analysis of the expected number of faults is used to
   uniquely determine the secret key. It is based on the propagation of
   truncated differentials and is surprisingly reminiscent of the
   computation of the complexity of a rectangle attack. It shows that the
   impossible meet-in-the-middle fault analysis could successfully break
   the LED by fault injections.}},

Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{86}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Current urban and district energy management systems lack a common
   semantic referential for effectively interrelating intelligent sensing,
   data models and energy models with visualization, analysis and decision
   support tools. This paper describes the structure, as well as the
   rationale that led to this structure, of an ontology that captures the
   real-world concepts of a district energy system, such as a district
   heating and cooling system. This ontology (called ee-district ontology)
   is intended to support knowledge provision that can play the role of an
   intermediate layer between high-level energy management software
   applications and local monitoring and control software components. In
   order to achieve that goal, the authors propose to encapsulate queries
   to the ontology in a scalable web service, which will facilitate the
   development of interfaces for third-party applications. Considering the
   size of the ee-district ontology once populated with data from a
   specific district case study, this could prove to be a repetitive and
   time-consuming task for the software developer. This paper therefore
   assesses the feasibility of ontology-driven automation of web service
   development that is to be a core element in the deployment of
   heterogeneous district-wide energy management software.}},

Abstract = {{Accessibility diagnosis of as-built urban environments is essential for
   path planning, especially in case of people with reduced mobility and it
   requires an in-depth knowledge of ground elements. In this paper, we
   present a new approach for automatically detect and classify urban
   ground elements from 3D point clouds. The methodology enables a high
   level of detail classification from the combination of geometric and
   topological information. The method starts by a planar segmentation
   followed by a refinement based on split and merge operations. Next, a
   feature analysis and a geometric decision tree are followed to classify
   regions in preliminary classes. Finally, adjacency is studied to verify
   and correct the preliminary classification based on a comparison with a
   topological graph library. The methodology is tested in four real
   complex case studies acquired with a Mobile Laser Scanner Device. In
   total, five classes are considered (roads, sidewalks, treads, risers and
   curbs). Results show a success rate of 97\% in point classification,
   enough to analyse extensive urban areas from an accessibility point of
   view. The combination of topology and geometry improves a 10\% to 20\%
   the success rate obtained with only the use of geometry.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses the strategic governance challenges of modern smart
   cities from the new viewpoint of big data management. It seeks to
   develop and highlight a systematic methodological framework for handling
   multivariate big data in a smart urban decision support context in the
   `New Urban World', so as to enhance the cities' competitive performance
   through the design and development of operational urban management
   principles and strategies. The specific aim of this paper is to provide
   the critical and basic cornerstones for an applicable interactive
   dashboard architecture as a supporting tool in a structured process of
   innovative city strategies and consequent enhanced socio-economic
   performance. A core element in the present paper is formed by a smart
   urban dashboard system that acts as an interactive navigation tool
   supporting operational choices of all stakeholders involved. This
   dashboard is able to integrate complex and ever-changing big data bases
   serving as `signposts' of city intelligence (or i-city smartness) for
   daily or strategic decisions of all urban stakeholders. This study thus
   outlines successively the concept of smart i-cities in our `urban
   century', the great potential of digital technology for managing big
   data in governing i-cities, and the foundations of an urban dashboard on
   the basis of the so-called Pentagon model as a policy strategy vehicle.
   Starting from extensive data on a broad set of global cities, the
   potential of this approach is exemplified by means of an illustrative
   application of a smart urban dashboard for the city of Stockholm.}},

Abstract = {{The research described in this paper is undertaken under the banner of
   the smart city, a concept that captures the way urban spaces are re-made
   by the incursion of new technology. Much of smart is centred on
   converting everyday activities into data, and using this data to
   generate knowledge mediated by technology. Ordinary citizens, those that
   may have their lives impacted by the technology, usually are not
   properly involved in the `smartification' process. Their perceptions,
   concerns and expectations should inform the conception and development
   of smart technologies at the same extent. How to engage general public
   with smart cities research is the central challenge for the Making
   Metrics Meaningful (MMM) project. Applying a rapid participatory method,
   `Imagine' over a five-month period (March - July) the research sought to
   gain insights from the general public into novel forms of information
   system innovation. This brief paper describes the nature of the
   accelerated research undertaken and explores some of the themes which
   emerged in the analysis. Generic themes, beyond the remit of an explicit
   transport focus, are developed and pointers towards further research
   directions are discussed. Participatory methods, including engaging with
   self-selected transport users actively through both picture creation and
   programmatically specific musical `signatures' as well as group
   discussion, were found to be effective in eliciting users' own concerns,
   needs and ideas for novel information systems.}},

Abstract = {{A smart city (SC) is a modernized urban community, which incorporates
   information and communication technology (ICT) into the existing
   physical infrastructure. It offers reliable and uninterrupted services
   such as-intelligent transport and energy conservation to its residents.
   Among the various services offered, a continuous and widespread supply
   of electricity draws the maximum attention. Moreover, a substantial
   amount of this electricity is utilized by heating and cooling loads,
   making them significant contributors of global warming. Keeping focus on
   these points, a SC is modeled in this paper, wherein electricity
   consumption is minimized by modifying the traditional heating and
   cooling system. The proposed system collects solar heat and recovers
   industrial waste heat to deliver heating and cooling services to the SC
   residents. For the purpose of storing the heat energy, a seasonal
   thermal energy storage (STES) system has been proposed. The proposed
   STES system supplies stored thermal energy to heat-driven cooling and
   heating equipments. Moreover, central energy management system (CEMS) is
   also modeled for monitoring, regulating and controlling the flow of
   thermal energy. The designed CEMS consists of a Fuzzy rough set
   controller for scheduling heat to cater the instantaneous thermal energy
   requirements. Fuzzy rough set has been used because it eliminates the
   issues of vagueness, uncertainty, and ensures efficient real-time
   computations. Results depict that the heat energy obtained from solar
   thermal collectors and industrial wastes is able to meet the
   requirements of the SC after scheduling it using Fuzzy rough set
   algorithm.}},

Title = {{The social effects of eco-innovations in Italian smart cities}},
Journal = {{CITIES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{115-121}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The European Union promotes the paradigm of ecological modernization and
   the effectiveness of eco-innovations (European Environment Agency,
   2014). This is evident, in particular, from the political and financial
   support that the Institution is devoting to smart cities. Thus far, most
   of the `smart' projects developed in European cities focus on the theme
   of the environment and its efficient management (European Union, 2014).
   However, what has not yet been adequately investigated is the issue of
   the social impact of these smart environmental projects (Beretta, 2014a,
   b, c). In particular, what seems important is the question of whether
   the projects with environmental objectives also yield beneficial results
   from the social point of view, with special reference to the issue of
   social inclusion. Who are the real beneficiaries of the projects of
   eco-innovation? Do the benefits extend to all citizens or are they
   likely to go to only some sectors of the population, often the wealthier
   ones, risking - among other things - promotion of the phenomenon of
   eco-gentrification? In more general terms, can we say that smart cities
   represent the `ideal' settings for the achievement of simultaneous
   environmental, economic and social development?
   This paper reports results from research conducted on smart
   environmental projects implemented in Italy and posted on the national
   web platform italiansmartcity.it. The project consisted in a qualitative
   analysis of the environmental projects presented, in order to analyze
   their social impacts, especially referring to the question of social
   inclusiveness and the risk of eco-gentrification. More generally, the
   analysis helps clarify whether the eco-innovations represent an
   effective tool for achieving sustainable development in the Italian
   context.
   Having said that, it cannot be assumed that readers are familiar with
   the European and Italian contexts. Par. 1 opens with a table that gives
   definitions of terms which are potentially not clear. It then shows ways
   that the European Union is institutionalizing eco-innovation and smart
   cities, remaining on the latest debate on them. Par. 2 highlights the
   risk of the technological rut the European Union is falling into; par. 3
   illustrates the main results of research carried out on the smart cities
   in the Lombardy Region regarding the social effects of eco-innovations;
   par. 4 attempts to draw a provisional conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{The last decades in urban design research are characterised by a focus
   on technological aspects of cities which is commonly known as the smart
   city strategy. The concerns and interests of citizens are coming to the
   forefront nowadays with the awareness that a liveable city does not only
   consist of good infrastructure and sustainable energy supply but also
   citizen input and feedback. In this paper, we present Citizen Design
   Science as a new strategy for cities to integrate citizens' ideas and
   wishes in the urban planning process. The approach is to combine the
   opportunity of crowdsourcing opinions and thoughts by citizens through
   modern information and communication technology (ICT) with active design
   tools. The active design feedback from a city's inhabitants is
   identified as a yet missing but essential way towards a responsive city.
   We therefore propose a system to merge Citizen Science and Citizen
   Design, which requires a structured evaluation process to integrate
   Design Science methods for urban design.
   We show examples of existing approaches of Citizen Design Science and
   present the Quick Urban Analysis Kit (qua-kit) as an application of this
   methodology. The toolkit allows users to move geometries in given
   environments and provides the opportunity for non-experts to express
   their ideas for their neighbourhood or city.}},

Title = {{Improstructure - an improvisational perspective on smart infrastructure

Abstract = {{Infrastructure modernization is a central concern in many cities of the
   developing world. Local governments struggle to provide adequate public
   services under budgetary constraints and vast spatial and economic
   inequalities. After the demise of the centralized modernist planning
   paradigm, current approaches to urban development focus on
   public-private partnerships, resulting in networks of dependency that
   involve multiple stakeholders and complex relationships of
   accountability. This stakeholder complexity complicates decision making,
   but can also lead to new social practices and paiticipatory models of
   infrastructure governance.
   This paper presents the results of a qualitative study of social
   practices surrounding the provision and modernization of streetlight and
   electricity in Paco, Manila, enacted by formal and informal actors.
   Drawing from the case study, literature on organizational improvisation
   and improvisational governance (Martijn Hartog, 2015), we propose a
   model of infrastructure governance that is based on the concept of
   improvisation. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with city
   officials, planners, residents and local activists, we develop the
   notion of improstructure as a conceptual model for understanding
   infrastructure governance as an improvisational process of ``call and
   response{''} among a diverse set of actors.
   We apply this perspective to ongoing modernization efforts by the city
   of Manila and its utility companies, involving smart city technologies
   including sensor networks, drone mapping, and data analytics. We argue
   that despite the placeless and generic rhetoric surrounding these
   technologies, they constitute improvisational responses to local
   conditions. We conclude by formulating design principles for
   improvisational infrastructure governance, which are not limited to the
   Global South, but also apply in developed countries.}},

Abstract = {{European Strategy 2020, a series of priorities and initiatives that will
   transform the EU into a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy, with
   high rates of employment, productivity and social cohesion, recognized
   cities as units crucial for social, cultural and economic progress and
   sparked the development of new integrated urban strategies (IUSs) across
   the EU. By the end of 2016, 11 Slovenian cities had developed and
   ratified their own strategic plans in order to manage their urban
   development. We analyzed the content of the IUSs and supporting
   documents of Slovenian cities in order to evaluate the quality of IUSs
   in terms of empirical groundedness, logical consistency and structure
   and to assess the conformity of these documents with Europe 2020
   strategy and national guidelines. Our results show that the IUSs of
   Slovenian cities are generally of low quality and that they conform to
   the Europe 2020 strategy poorly, but rather more to national guidelines
   defined by the Slovenian government. The implications of these findings
   for EU policy in the area of urban development are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a disruptive paradigm which will
   bring new ways of monitoring, control and management for Industry 4.0
   and Smart Cities. It relies on smart and connected sensors enabled by a
   new generation of communication technologies such as Wireless Sensor
   Networks (WSN). Although various solutions are becoming available, the
   reality is most of the end users of these systems won't be
   communications experts, so the complexity and deployment difficulties
   are strong barriers for adopting this technology. This article briefly
   summarizes the state of art of current industrial wireless sensor
   networks technology, and presents the concept of Deploy\&Forget network:
   a solution to enable the rapid deployment of WSN by assisting users
   onsite, reducing time and complexity of deployment, and includes a
   designed protocol stack to ensure unattended and long lasting operation.
   This technology emerges as an evolution of previous WSN works where
   these problems where clearly identified, and has been deployed and

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{491}},

Abstract = {{With the widespread implementation of smart cards and with more travel
   details being recorded, travel patterns can be studied more precisely
   and deeply. Although considerable attention has been paid to travel
   patterns, the relationship between travel patterns and the functional
   structure of a city is yet to be well understood. In this research, we
   study this relationship by analysing metro passenger trip data (in
   Beijing and Shenzhen in China and London in the United Kingdom), and we
   present two unprecedented findings. First, through averaging, a linear
   relationship is found to exist between individual travel distance and
   the distance between the origin and the city centre. The underlying
   mechanism is a travel pattern we call ``ring aggregation{''}, i.e., the
   daily movement of city passengers is aggregated into a ring (with
   approximately equal distances to the city centre). Then, for commuting
   trips, the daily travel pattern can be regarded as switching between the
   outer residential ring and the inner work ring. Second, this linear
   relationship and the ring aggregation pattern seem to be exclusive
   characteristics of metro systems (and may also fit other moderate- and
   long-distance transportation modes) but do not apply to short-distance
   transportation modes, such as bicycles and taxis. This finding implies
   that the ring aggregation pattern is a product of the relationship
   between travel patterns and the city functional structure at a large
   scope. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Together with the increasing population and urbanization, cities have
   started to face challenges that hinder their socio-economic and
   sustainable development. The concept of smart cities, therefore, has
   emerged during the last years as a response to these problems. Advanced
   measurement and communication technologies enabled through smart cities
   have particularly played a key role in dealing with such economic,
   social and organizational challenges faced during the growing of cities.
   In this sense, using historical information provided with the mentioned
   technologies, various forecasting tools have been incorporated into
   smart city environment in order to manage more effectively its essential
   components such as smart grids and Intelligent Transportation Systems
   (ITS). For a further improvement in forecasting accuracy and hence in
   the management of these smart systems, recently, the information
   available in space has been also introduced in forecasting tools in
   addition to that in time. These advanced forecasting approaches, called
   spatio-temporal methods, have the capability of making use of all the
   available data collected from different locations. The potential
   benefits of these approaches have been underlined in various recent
   studies in the literature. In this paper, a comprehensive overview and
   assessment of forecasting approaches including both spatial and temporal
   information have been presented for the purpose of supporting the
   ongoing efforts for exploiting the available information in smart city
   applications. With this objective, the spatio-temporal forecasting
   methods presented in the literature are classified considering their
   implementation areas and model structures. Furthermore, the similarities
   and peculiarities of the methods classified are examined in detail,
   resulted in the compiling of valuable reference information for future
   studies on improving these approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a feasibility study was carried out in terms of
   quantification-characterization of waste, biomethane potential from
   organic biomass and bio-digester selection and designing. From waste
   quantification, 38\% was found to be an organic fraction of the
   municipal solid waste (OFMSW) of the 1.4 million tonnes per year. The
   composition of the waste was investigated using a laboratory batch
   anaerobic digester for biochemical methane potential (BMP) and the waste
   to energy bio-digester selection and design for the anaerobic
   co-digestion of different OFMSW originating from the City of
   Johannesburg landfills. The carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of OFMSW was
   found to be below 13. Through co-digestion, the C/N ratio settled at 15.
   Laboratory experimental data from 500 ml batch anaerobic digester
   operating at a mesophilic temperature of 37 degrees C and pH of 6.9 had
   a good productivity of methane of average 59\% recommended in the
   literature and was used to derive the volume of digester and surface
   area. The artificial intelligence (AI) technique was applied to select
   the most preferred digester model. Using the application of the simple
   multi-attribute rating (SMART) technique of multiple-criteria decision
   analysis (MCDA) as a decision support tool, the most preferred option of
   a bio-digester model was selected from a list of potential alternatives
   available in the market. The continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR)
   scored highest with 79\% and was selected as the most preferred digester
   for the OFMSW digestion. The geometry of the biodigester parameters was
   found to be comparable and economically feasible with the process
   parameters, energy generation from the BMP and scale up model for the
   independent power producer (IPP).}},

Title = {{On the evolution of ``Cleaner Production{''} as a concept and a practice}},

Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{``Cleaner Production{''}(CP) is about less and more efficient energy and
   materials use and the substitution of more harmful products (for the
   environment and health) by less dangerous ones. CP was the reply of the
   industry to the call for sustainable development as launched by the WCED
   (1987) and further elaborated in Rio's Agenda 21 (UN, 1992). During the
   past 25 years, the concept was put in practice. During this period it
   changed in scope, methods, and application area. This provided a deeper
   socioeconomic impact to an idea that was originally launched to awaken
   industry on its environmental responsibilities.
   This paper provides a review of essentials that contributed to the
   fundamental changes in CP during the most recent quarter of a century.
   It takes off with a review of CP definitions illustrating the changes of
   the content. Changes in scope are exemplified with the increasing
   importance of ``Corporate Social Responsibility{''} (CSR). This includes
   that post-modern companies have not only responsibilities on their
   economic performance and the environment, but should also act on issues
   including human rights and resources, business ethics, and community
   involvement. The links between CP and green and circular economy are
   indicated. The CP approach is increasingly applied outside the industry.
   CP for sustainable tourism is discussed in more detail but is only an
   example of the wider application in e.g. agriculture or health services.
   This widening of contents necessitates more and better-adapted methods
   supporting the measurement of the CP components. Indicators, assessment
   strategies, and green accounting are increasingly improved and used more
   specifically and frequently.
   This evolution is discussed in a context of a dilution of the original
   environmental targets in a wider, more societal scope and the transition
   towards a more responsible, proactive and reliable management of the
   sectors applying CP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Wind characterization in Taranto city as a basis for innovative
   sustainable urban development}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{172}},
Pages = {{3535-3545}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{The city of Taranto, in the south-east of Italy, is experiencing a
   transition from one of the most polluted and industrialized area
   characterized by the presence of the largest integrated steelworks in
   Europe, to a center of attractions of investments in innovation on
   sustainability and tourism. Among sustainability projects, urban wind
   energy is emerging as a technology useful in diffusion of smart grids
   for energetic sustainable development and also an interesting growing
   niche market in which there could be new investment opportunities.
   Numerous projects aimed at developing wind energy production are under
   constructions and wind characteristics and power potential of various
   sites have been studied in many Mediterranean countries. The urban wind
   analysis may represent a new tool to complete local wind atlases
   including the built environment, to evaluate changes that weathering may
   cause in the physical and architectural state of buildings, and to
   analyze the dispersion of pollutants from sources to receptor sites. In
   this paper, an analysis of wind potential and characteristics in
   Taranto, Apulia, a north Jonian urban site in Italy, has been performed
   by using high time resolved (10 min) meteorological data collected over
   a time span of two years, in the aim to describe the numerical
   procedures adopted to perform fitting of wind speed data without using
   special software. This urban site, in the first year of investigation
   from May 1st, 2009 to April 30th, 2010, was subjected to main wind
   regimes that come mostly from N with 12.27\% and SSW with 9.89\% of
   total hours; the calm occurred with a frequency of 10.94\%. In the
   second year, from May 1st, 2010 to April 30th, 2011, the winds also
   blown predominantly from N with 12.56\% of the total annual hours, and
   SSW with 9.33\%, while the calms reached 11.08\%. Dispersion of
   pollutants emitted from various sources among cement factory, a
   quarry/landfill, a refinery and the steelworks, poses serious health
   risks to population mainly resident downwind the prevalent wind
   directions. Simply computed mean wind speeds had values of 1.84 (sd =
   0.26 m/s) in the first year and 1.90 m/s (sd = 0.30 m/s) in the second
   year under investigation. Weibull's k values, measuring the wind
   potential of the site, were higher during the spring-summer warmest
   months and lower during the autumn-winter; the lowest appeared in
   November 2009 (0.639) the highest in June 2010 (1.665). Mean yearly
   values of k were 1.210 (sd = 0.18) in the first year and 1.065 (sd =
   0.24) in the second year of the study, the correlation between the
   monthly values of k in the years under consideration was R2 = 0.59 (p =
   0.043) indicating that although variations occurred, the wind potential
   remain partly unaltered from one year to the other examined. LCOE
   (Levelized Cost of Electricity) for the wind turbines chosen among the
   35 ones listed in the ``Catalogue of European Urban Wind Turbine
   Manufactures{''}, excluding those with rated power below 0.1 kW, ranged
   from 0.12 to 10.6 /kWh and differs slightly in the two years examined.
   The values were competitive with some off-shore and on-shore
   installations, biogas and photovoltaic, but it does not consider
   pollution costs and subsidies. The proposed solution was economically
   viable, also by considering the possible integration in a hybrid
   photovoltaic-wind system, or fossil-based heat generator system
   supplemented by solar photovoltaic and wind energy. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Advancements in smart devices, wearable gadgets, sensors, and
   communication paradigm have enabled the vision of smart cities,
   pervasive healthcare, augmented reality and interactive multimedia,
   Internet of Every Thing (loE), and cognitive assistance, to name a few.
   All of these visions have one thing in common, i.e., delay sensitivity
   and instant response. Various new technologies designed to work at the
   edge of the network, such as fog computing, cloudlets, mobile edge
   computing, and micro data centers have emerged in the near past. We use
   the name ``edge computing{''} for this set of emerging technologies.
   Edge computing is a promising paradigm to offer the required computation
   and storage resources with minimal delays because of ``being near{''} to
   the users or terminal devices. Edge computing aims to bring cloud
   resources and services at the edge of the network, as a middle layer
   between end user and cloud data centers, to offer prompt service
   response with minimal delay. Two major aims of edge computing can be
   denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users' request
   at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data
   centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the
   network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings
   energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can
   be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of
   service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data)
   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by
   processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and
   uploading the processed information to cloud. This survey presents a
   detailed overview of potentials, trends, and challenges of edge
   computing. The survey illustrates a list of most significant
   applications and potentials in the area of edge computing. State of the
   art literature on edge computing domain is included in the survey to
   guide readers towards the current trends and future opportunities in the
   area of edge computing. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Abstract = {{The smart bike-sharing program (BSP), which is a novel bike-sharing mode
   of traditional BSP, has become popular in many cities in China. However,
   most BSP studies focus only on the socio-economic characteristics of the
   users, bike-sharing patterns, and impacts that influence bike-sharing
   demand. This study increases the knowledge on BSPs by presenting a
   hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making approach that is based on
   multi-phase quality function deployment. This approach covers the
   performance evaluation of smart BSPs allowing for customer voices under
   uncertain conditions. This method combines the fuzzy best-worst method
   (BWM), fuzzy maximizing deviation method (MDM), and fuzzy
   multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis plus the full
   multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA). It uses fuzzy BWM to determine
   priorities of customer requirements and company strategies and to obtain
   subjective importance coefficients of criteria. Fuzzy MDM is used to
   derive objective importance coefficients of criteria and fuzzy
   MULTIMOORA is used to rank alternatives in terms of each criterion. An
   empirical case in Changsha, which is one of the pilot areas for
   comprehensively supporting the reform for an environment-friendly and
   resource-conserving society ({''}two-oriented society{''}) in China, is
   provided to illustrate the application of the proposed framework.
   Results can help enterprises and organizations improve their performance
   and provide high-quality products and services for customers. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Being a small well-organized city state, Singapore appears to be an
   ideal place to establish a fully electric road transport system. To
   analyze the challenges and potential of electric mobility (or
   ``electromobility{''}), TUMCREATE Ltd., a company funded by Singapore's
   National Research Foundation, was launched in 2011 as ``Centre for
   Electromobility in Megacities{''}. During the first five years, the
   research at TUMCREATE covered everything ``from the molecule to the
   megacity{''}, that is, from fundamental research on new materials for
   energy storage systems to battery cells, battery packs, vehicle
   technology, in-vehicle electronics to road infrastructure and the power
   system. One outcome was a prototype for an electric taxi for tropical
   megacities called EVA with a battery capacity of 50 kWh and fast
   charging capability of 160 kW. This paper presents a review of past and
   ongoing activities in the field of integration of electromobility into
   Singapore's power system. The focus of this publication lies on charging
   of electric vehicles (EVs). Results show that the integration of EVs
   into the power system is feasible, leads to lower emissions, and can
   even offer new services and support integration of renewable energies.}},

Title = {{An urban building database (UBD) supporting a smart city information
   system}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{158}},
Pages = {{244-260}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Urban energy modelling requires a large amount of detailed data to
   perform systematic dynamic simulations of a large number of buildings,
   where the adoption of energy efficiency strategies is an important
   concern for sustainable urban planning.
   National statistical datasets collect important aggregated data
   regarding building construction, energy consumption and occupants, and
   cities are making a significant effort to update spatial referenced data
   of their territory. However, these data is generally not detailed
   enough, being available at different scales and in different formats.
   The integrated use of these data is critical to validate different
   methods to predict and model energy consumption in cities, as well in
   addressing its energy saving potential. Furthermore, scenario analysis
   for retrofit or new design is only possible at building scale,
   highlighting the potential of a bottom-up database.
   This paper presents the process of collecting, mapping, cleansing and
   integrating urban data resulting in an UBD to support an information
   system for Smart Cities. The goal is to reduce the gap between the
   available urban data and the specific data required to run a complete
   urban building energy simulation. Key characteristics of an UBD are
   explored and applied to a case study in Lisbon, Portugal.
   As a result, a Buildings Dashboard is developed, materializing the UBD
   user interface. This dashboard allows the interactive visualization and
   data exploration of the building stock at multiple scales. Future work
   includes the development of an Urban Scenario category, bringing new
   insights on urban energy simulation and scenario evaluation to this
   platform. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Intelligent recognition of traffic police command gestures increases
   authenticity and interactivity in virtual urban scenes. To actualize
   real-time traffic gesture recognition, a novel spatiotemporal
   convolution neural network (ST-CNN) model is presented. We utilized
   Kinect 2.0 to construct a traffic police command gesture skeleton
   (TPCGS) dataset collected from 10 volunteers. Subsequently, convolution
   operations on the locational change of each skeletal point were
   performed to extract temporal features, analyze the relative positions
   of skeletal points, and extract spatial features. After temporal and
   spatial features based on the three-dimensional positional information
   of traffic police skeleton points were extracted, the ST-CNN model
   classified positional information into eight types of Chinese traffic
   police gestures. The test accuracy of the ST-CNN model was 96.67\%. In
   addition, a virtual urban traffic scene in which real-time command tests
   were carried out was set up, and a real-time test accuracy rate of
   93.0\% was achieved. The proposed ST-CNN model ensured a high level of
   accuracy and robustness. The ST-CNN model recognized traffic command
   gestures, and such recognition was found to control vehicles in virtual
   traffic environments, which enriches the interactive mode of the virtual
   city scene. Traffic command gesture recognition contributes to smart
   city construction.}},

   through innovation, communication, and interactivity with
   tourists/visitors. A survey of 423 tourists visiting the city provided
   the data for this study. The analysis focuses on the availability of ICT
   in Porto and its influence on tourists' decisions to visit the city.
   This information helps to determine whether the application and
   information available on the Internet had positively contributed to
   tourists' satisfaction in their visits to Porto. In particular, this
   article focuses on the influence of ICT accessibility on tourists'
   choices of destination, their experiences, and their satisfaction. The

Abstract = {{Ever since the earthquake of April 6, 2009 hit the city of L'Aquila,
   Italy, the city has been facing major challenges in terms of social,
   physical, and economic reconstruction. The system of public urban
   mobility, the bus network, is no exception with its old bus fleet,
   non-user-friendly information, and poor scheduling. This paper argues
   that the public transportation system of L'Aquila could be improved
   towards smart mobility models without large infrastructure investment by
   leveraging the infostructure approach, digital technologies, open data,
   and open source software. This work presents the digitization and
   geo-referencing procedure, software architecture, and the web and mobile
   apps that have been developed to improve the information flow available
   to citizens and to increase the user-friendliness of the transportation
   system. Future research will seek to make use of the data and develop

Abstract = {{According to UNESCO, education is a fundamental human right and every
   nation's citizens should be granted universal access with equal quality
   to it. Because this goal is yet to be achieved in most countries, in
   particular in the developing and underdeveloped countries, it is
   extremely important to find more effective ways to improve education.
   This paper presents a model based on the application of computational
   intelligence (data mining and data science) that leads to the
   development of the student's knowledge profile and that can help
   educators in their decision making for best orienting their students.
   This model also tries to establish key performance indicators to monitor
   objectives' achievement within individual strategic planning assembled
   for each student. The model uses random forest for classification and
   prediction, graph description for data structure visualization and
   recommendation systems to present relevant information to stakeholders.
   The results presented were built based on the real dataset obtained from
   a Brazilian private k-9 (elementary school). The obtained results
   include correlations among key data, a model to predict student
   performance and recommendations that were generated for the

Title = {{Design and Practical Evaluation of a Family of Lightweight Protocols for
   Heterogeneous Sensing through BLE Beacons in IoT Telemetry Applications}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) involves a wide variety of heterogeneous
   technologies and resource-constrained devices that interact with each
   other. Due to such constraints, IoT devices usually require lightweight
   protocols that optimize the use of resources and energy consumption.
   Among the different commercial IoT devices, Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low
   Energy (BLE)-based beacons, which broadcast periodically certain data
   packets to notify their presence, have experienced a remarkable growth,
   specially due to their application in indoor positioning systems. This
   article proposes a family of protocols named Lightweight Protocol for
   Sensors (LP4S) that provides fast responses and enables plug-and-play
   mechanisms that allow IoT telemetry systems to discover new nodes and to
   describe and auto-register the sensors and actuators connected to a
   beacon. Thus, three protocols are defined depending on the beacon
   hardware characteristics: LP4S-6 (for resource-constraint beacons),
   LP4S-X (for more powerful beacons) and LP4S-J (for beacons able to run
   complex firmware). In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the
   designed protocols, the most restrictive (LP4S-6) is tested after
   implementing it for a telemetry application in a beacon based on
   Eddystone (Google's open beacon format). Thus, the beacon specification
   is extended in order to increase its ability to manage unlimited sensors
   in a telemetry system without interfering in its normal operation with
   Eddystone frames. The performed experiments show the feasibility of the
   proposed solution and its superiority, in terms of latency and energy
   consumption, with respect to approaches based on Generic Attribute
   Profile (GATT) when multiple users connect to a mote or in scenarios
   where latency is not a restriction, but where low-energy consumption is
   essential.}},

Title = {{Towards the Use of Unmanned Aerial Systems for Providing Sustainable
   Services in Smart Cities}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Sustainability is at the heart of many application fields where the use
   of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) is becoming more and more important
   (e.g., agriculture, fire detection and prediction, environmental
   surveillance, mapping, etc.). However, their usage and evolution are
   highly conditioned by the specific application field they are designed
   for, and thus, they cannot be easily reused among different application
   fields. From this point of view, being that they are not multipurpose,
   we can say that they are not fully sustainable. Bearing this in mind,
   the objective of this paper is two-fold: on the one hand, to identify
   the whole set of features that must be provided by a UAS to be
   considered sustainable and to show that there is no UAS satisfying all
   these features; on the other hand, to present an open and sustainable
   UAS architecture that may be used to build UAS on demand to provide the
   features needed in each application field. Since this architecture is
   mainly based on software and hardware adaptability, it contributes to
   the technical sustainability of cities.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce energy consumption and improve residents' quality of life,
   ``smart cities{''} should use not only modern technologies, but also the
   social innovations of the ``Internet of Things{''} (IoT) era. This
   article attempts to solve transport problems in a smart city's office
   district by utilizing gamification that incentivizes the carpooling
   system. The goal of the devised system is to significantly reduce the
   number of cars, and, consequently, to alleviate traffic jams, as well as
   to curb pollution and energy consumption. A representative sample of the
   statistical population of people working in one of the biggest office
   hubs in Poland (the so-called ``Mordor of Warsaw{''}) was surveyed. The
   collected data were processed using spatial data mining methods, and the
   results were a set of parameters for the multi-agent system. This
   approach made it possible to run a series of simulations on a set of
   100,000 agents and to select an effective gamification methodology that
   supports the carpooling process. The implementation of the proposed
   solutions (a ``serious game{''} variation of urban games) would help to
   reduce the number of cars by several dozen percent, significantly reduce
   energy consumption, eliminate traffic jams, and increase the activity of
   the smart city residents.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of detection of parking space availability is still
   growing, particularly in major cities. This paper deals with the design
   of a distributed wireless camera system for the management of parking
   spaces, which can determine occupancy of the parking space based on the
   information from multiple cameras. The proposed system uses small camera
   modules based on Raspberry Pi Zero and computationally efficient
   algorithm for the occupancy detection based on the histogram of oriented
   gradients (HOG) feature descriptor and support vector machine (SVM)
   classifier. We have included information about the orientation of the
   vehicle as a supporting feature, which has enabled us to achieve better
   accuracy. The described solution can deliver occupancy information at
   the rate of 10 parking spaces per second with more than 90\% accuracy in
   a wide range of conditions. Reliability of the implemented algorithm is
   evaluated with three different test sets which altogether contain over
   700,000 samples of parking spaces.}},

Abstract = {{The replica strategy in distributed cache can effectively reduce user

   replica strategy suitable for varied application scenarios is still
   quite challenging, owing to differences in user access behavior and
   preferences. In this paper, a replication strategy for spatiotemporal

   advantage of the spatiotemporal locality and correlation of user access,
   RSSD mines high popularity and associated files from historical user
   access information, and then generates replicas and selects appropriate
   cache node for placement. Experimental results show that the RSSD

Title = {{Density-Based Statistical Clustering: Enabling Sidefire Ultrasonic
   Traffic Sensing in Smart Cities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Abstract = {{Traffic routing is a central challenge in the context of urban areas,
   with a direct impact on personal mobility, traffic congestion, and air
   pollution. In the last decade, the possibilities for traffic flow
   control have improved together with the corresponding management
   systems. However, the lack of real-time traffic flow information with a
   city-wide coverage is a major limiting factor for an optimum operation.
   Smart City concepts seek to tackle these challenges in the future by
   combining sensing, communications, distributed information, and
   actuation. This paper presents an integrated approach that combines
   smart street lamps with traffic sensing technology. More specifically,
   infrastructure-based ultrasonic sensors, which are deployed together
   with a street light system, are used for multilane traffic participant
   detection and classification. Application of these sensors in
   time-varying reflective environments posed an unresolved problem for
   many ultrasonic sensing solutions in the past and therefore widely
   limited the dissemination of this technology. We present a solution
   using an algorithmic approach that combines statistical standardization
   with clustering techniques from the field of unsupervised learning. By
   using a multilevel communication concept, centralized and decentralized
   traffic information fusion is possible. The evaluation is based on
   results from automotive test track measurements and several European
   real-world installations.}},

Title = {{The City Blueprint Approach: Urban Water Management and Governance in
   Cities in the U.S}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we assess the challenges of water, waste and climate
   change in six cities across the U.S.: New York City, Boston, Milwaukee,
   Phoenix, Portland and Los Angeles. We apply the City Blueprint (R)
   Approach which consists of three indicator assessments: (1) the Trends
   and Pressures Framework (TPF), (2) the City Blueprint Framework (CBF)
   and (3) the water Governance Capacity Framework (GCF). The TPF
   summarizes the main social, environmental and financial pressures that
   may impede water management. The CBF provides an integrated overview of
   the management performances within the urban watercycle. Finally, the
   GCF provides a framework to identify key barriers and opportunities to
   develop governance capacity. The GCF has only been applied in NYC.
   Results show that all cities face pressures from heat risk. The
   management performances regarding resource efficiency and resource
   recovery from wastewater and solid waste show considerable room for
   improvement. Moreover, stormwater separation, infrastructure maintenance
   and green space require improvement in order to achieve a resilient
   urban watercycle. Finally, in New York City, the GCF results show that
   learning through smart monitoring, evaluation and cross-stakeholder
   learning is a limiting condition that needs to be addressed. We conclude
   that the City Blueprint Approach has large potential to assist cities in
   their strategic planning and exchange of knowledge, experiences and
   lessons. Because the methodology is well-structured, easy to understand,
   and concise, it may bridge the gap between science, policy and practice.
   It could therefore enable other cities to address their challenges of
   water, waste and climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations will play an important role in
   the smart city. Uncoordinated and statistical EV charging loads would
   further stress the distribution system. Photovoltaic (PV) systems, which
   can reduce this stress, also show variation due to weather conditions.
   In this paper, a hybrid optimization algorithm for energy storage
   management is proposed, which shifts its mode of operation between the
   deterministic and rule-based approaches depending on the electricity
   price band allocation. The cost degradation model of the energy storage
   system (ESS) along with the levelized cost of PV power is used in the
   case of EV charging stations. The algorithm comprises of three parts:
   categorization of real-time electricity price in different price bands,
   real-time calculation of PV power from solar irradiation data, and
   optimization for minimizing the operating cost of EV charging station
   integrated with PV and ESS. An extensive simulation study is carried out
   with an uncoordinated and statistical EV charging model in the context
   of Singapore to check effectiveness of this algorithm. Furthermore,
   detailed analysis of subsidy and incentive to be given by the government
   agencies for higher penetration of renewable energy is also presented.
   This work would aid in planning of adoption of PV-integrated EV charging
   stations, which would expectedly replace traditional gas stations in
   future.}},

Abstract = {{The recent increase in the research interests towards a smart life style
   has introduced a huge number of devices into our life. Some devices are
   being used by us such as the smart phones while others are most of the
   time invisible to us such as proximity sensors and light sensors etc.
   These devices are being interconnected via Internet and are being
   utilized to read an environment, detect patterns and predict or forecast
   some events. Sharing the data and information collected by these
   desperate devices to clients over the Internet is called as Provision.
   Due to disparity in the hardware and software platforms for sensing
   devices, the provisioning services are also limited to providing
   contextual data based on single provider and there is no generic process
   model which can be utilized for composite context provisioning from
   multiple providers. This paper presents a service-oriented process model
   for composite context provisioning. A step by step explanation has been
   provided for each process involved and performance analysis has been
   carried out using a prototype implementation of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Passed in 2001, Brazil's Estatuto da Cidade (City Statute) requires
   municipalities to recognize the social value of space in addition to its
   economic value and has been hailed as a major protection for residents
   of informal settlements. As Brazil was thrust onto a global stage as
   host to the World Cup of Soccer and 2016 Summer Olympics, how are local
   government city officials balancing economic and social use amidst major
   urban renewal processes? Drawing upon voices of informal settlement
   residents in Fortaleza, Brazil, we examine the impact of transportation
   infrastructure upgrades on informal settlements. We find that despite
   the right to the city espoused in the Estatuto da Cidade, residents in
   informal settlements continue to be socially and physically
   marginalized. We examine why social use protections are not halting the
   displacement of informal settlements and discuss emerging landscapes of
   local activism resulting from this contradiction.}},

Journal = {{IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE}},

Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{92-98}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Smart communities are an emerging communication paradigm that mobilizes
   physical devices operating in different wireless networks to deliver
   ubiquitous services. Since wireless communication is vulnerable to
   physical or link layer jamming, it is essential to map the locations and
   shapes of jammed regions for adjusting routing policy. However, existing
   mapping strategies require jammed devices to override the carrier sense
   multiple access limitation for the declaration of jamming. Besides, the
   utilization of flat network architectures in existing mapping strategies
   incurs large communication overhead. In this article, a three-layer
   hierarchical network structure and a matching top-down mapping mechanism
   are proposed. Through organizing smart nodes into one-hop clusters, the
   jamming phenomenon can be discovered purely from cluster heads' data
   reports collected in the sink layer. Each one-hop cluster is also used
   as a basic mapping unit to identify and measure jammed regions. From
   cluster-level mapping to sensor-level mapping, jammed areas can be
   mapped from coarse-to fine-grained. Simulation results demonstrate that
   the mapping traffic involved in the proposed jammed-area mapping
   strategy can be reduced substantially.}},

Abstract = {{The Smart City concept revolves around the idea of embodying
   cutting-edge information and communication technology solutions in the
   very fabric of future cities to offer new and better services to
   citizens while lowering the city management costs in monetary, social,
   and environmental terms. In this framework, communication technologies
   are perceived as subservient to the Smart City services, providing the
   means to collect and process the data needed to make the services
   function. In this paper, we propose a new vision in which technology and
   Smart City services are designed to take advantage of each other in a
   symbiotic manner. According to this new paradigm, which we call
   SymbioCity, Smart City services can indeed be exploited to improve the
   performance of the same communication systems that provide them with
   data. Suggestive examples of this symbiotic ecosystem are discussed in
   this paper. The discussion is then substantiated in a proof-of-concept
   case study, where we show how the traffic monitoring service provided by
   the London Smart City initiative can be used to predict the density of
   users in a certain zone and optimize the cellular service in that area.}},

Abstract = {{Smart and data-driven technologies seek to create urban environments and
   systems that can operate efficiently and effortlessly. Yet, the design
   and implementation of such technical solutions are full of frictions,
   producing unanticipated consequences and generating turbulence that
   foreclose the creation of friction-free city solutions. In this paper,
   we examine the development of solutions for wait time predictions in the
   context of civic hacking to argue that a focus on frictions is important
   for establishing a critical understanding of innovation for urban
   everyday life. The empirical study adopted an ethnographically informed
   mobile methods approach to follow how frictions emerge and linger in the
   design and production of queue predictions developed through the civic
   hacking initiative, Code for Ireland. In so doing, the paper charts how
   solutions have to be worked up and strategies re-negotiated when a
   shared motivation meets different data sources, technical expertise,
   frames of understanding, urban imaginaries and organisational practices;
   and how solutions are contingently stabilised in technological,
   motivational, spatiotemporal and organisational specificities rather
   than unfolding in a smooth, linear, progressive trajectory. ResumeLes

   creation de solutions urbaines sans friction. Dans cet article, nous
   examinons le developpement de solutions pour les predictions de temps

   l'accent mis sur les frictions est important afin d'etablir une
   comprehension critique de l'innovation pour et dans la vie quotidienne

   ResumenLas tecnologias inteligentes y basadas en datos buscan crear
   ambientes urbanos y sistemas que pueden operar de manera eficiente y sin
   esfuerzo. Sin embargo, el diseno y la implementacion de este tipo de
   soluciones tecnicas estan llenos de fricciones, produciendo
   consecuencias imprevistas y generando tumulto que evitan la creacion de
   soluciones libres de friccion en la ciudad. En este trabajo, se analiza
   el desarrollo de soluciones para las predicciones de tiempo de espera en
   el contexto de la pirateria informatica civica para argumentar que un
   enfoque en fricciones es importante a la hora de establecer una
   comprension critica de la innovacion para y en la vida cotidiana urbana.
   El estudio empirico adopto un enfoque de metodos moviles

   soluciones tienen que ser trabajadas y las estrategias renegociadas
   cuando una motivacion compartida se encuentra con diferentes fuentes de
   datos, conocimientos tecnicos, marcos de entendimiento, imaginarios
   urbanos y practicas de organizacion; y como las soluciones se
   estabilizan en forma contingente en especificidades tecnologicas, de
   motivacion, espacio-temporales y de organizacion, en lugar de
   desplegarse en una trayectoria lineal, calma y progresiva.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts at urban e-mobility transition in China are of crucial global
   significance. Exploring these developments, however, demands significant
   reframing of dominant theories of socio-technical system transition to
   accommodate the strikingly different socio-political context of China to
   that of the global North where these theories have been developed. In
   particular, greater attention must be paid to issues of power,
   conceptualized as dynamic power/knowledge relations constitutive of
   social formations and evolving in interactive parallel with specific
   innovation trajectories. We illustrate such a productive reframing
   focusing on complex processes of empowerment and highlight that there
   remains relative stasis in the grand plan of a rapid transition to
   electric cars (EVs) in China's growing cities, with the EV still widely
   regarded as ``risky{''} mobility. At the same time the EV in China is
   becoming a constituent of a new kind of digitized and smart mobility, as
   Chinese ICT companies emerge as globally powerful players establishing
   alliances with traditional automobile companies.}},

Abstract = {{The massive urbanization process registered since 1950s and projected to
   continue for the coming decades is posing a crucial issue for the
   management of existing cities and the planning of future ones. Smart
   cities are often envisioned as ideal urban environments where the
   different dimensions of a city, such as economy, education, energy,
   environment, finance, etc., are managed in an effective and proactive
   way. Nevertheless, in order to reach this remarkable and challenging
   objective, analysis tools are required to create scenarios that are able
   to inform policy makers' decisions. Focusing on energy, this paper
   proposes an analysis method, based on exergy, to support smart city
   planning. It may help the decision makers to assess the energy-smartness
   of different scenarios, and to address urban energy policies.
   Possibilities and limitations of the analysis method are discussed via
   the application to the cities of London, Milan, and Lisbon that
   committed to become smart cities. Practical application: The paper
   summarizes a study on the possibilities and limitations of adopting an
   assessment technique, based on exergy, in order to evaluate the
   energy-smartness of policies in existing and future smart cities. As
   highlighted in the paper, building's energy uses have a huge share of
   many cities' energy breakdown. Thus, professionals in the building
   industry will be interested in the paper not only because it refers to
   smart cities, but because the built environment plays a pivotal role in
   them. Professionals may also refer to this study to perform a similar
   analysis in other urban environments to support decision makers.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless data broadcast is an efficient way of delivering data of common
   interest to a large population of mobile devices within a proximate
   area, such as smart cities, battle fields, etc. In this work, we focus
   ourselves on studying the data placement problem of periodic XML data
   broadcast in mobile and wireless environments. This is an important
   issue, particularly when XML becomes prevalent in today's ubiquitous and
   mobile computing devices and applications. Taking advantage of the
   structured characteristics of XML data, effective broadcast programs can
   be generated based on the XML data on the server only. An XML data
   broadcast system is developed and a theoretical analysis on the XML data
   placement on a wireless channel is also presented, which forms the basis
   of the novel data placement algorithm in this work. The proposed
   algorithm is validated through a set of experiments. The results show
   that the proposed algorithm can effectively place XML data on air and
   significantly improve the overall access efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by socio-economic processes, the influence of spatial factors on
   household energy related attitudes and perceptions is largely neglected
   in the literature. This paper analyses the extent to which energy
   perceptions and attitudes vary across different geographical contexts in
   Europe. We use representative Eurobarometer survey data to analyse how
   social conceptions of important energy issues, Europe's future energy
   priorities, and future energy system characteristics are shaped by
   rural, small urban, and large urban contexts. Using binary and ordered
   probit models, we find that householders in large and small areas are
   less likely to think of energy as a nationally important issue compared
   to their rural counterparts. Large city residents are less likely to
   think that renewables will play a significant role in the future energy
   system. Residents of large urban areas are more likely than those in
   rural areas to think that national energy policy should be centred on
   protecting the environment, guaranteeing a continuous supply of energy,
   and less around guaranteeing low prices for consumers.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of wireless multimedia sensor networks has given rise
   to intelligent transportation systems as a mobile data-sharing model.
   This vision can be extended under the umbrella of the mobile Internet of
   Things to include versatile resources, such as smartphones, radio
   frequency identification tags, and sensors on roads that can be utilized
   in emergency situations. The facilitation of such a vision faces key
   challenges in terms of interoperability, resource management and energy
   consumption. In this paper, we propose agile data delivery framework
   that caters for service-based applications in smart cities where
   multimedia data is heavily exchanged. Optimized routing approach that
   operates with limited resources in highly dynamic topologies is
   investigated and recommended. This approach assists in specifying which
   path a data packet should follow in order to determine the optimal usage
   of the available resources while satisfying QoS constraints for a wide
   range of real-time multimedia applications in safety and security
   fields. Simulation results, which have been validated via solid
   analytical analysis, are used to assess and outline the efficiency of
   the proposed approach in terms of system throughput, energy consumption,
   and average end-to-end delay against other similar approaches in the

Abstract = {{The increasing availability of spatiotemporal data continuously
   collected from various sources provides new opportunities for a timely
   understanding of the data in their spatial and temporal context. Finding
   abnormal patterns in such data poses significant challenges. Given that
   there is often no clear boundary between normal and abnormal patterns,
   existing solutions are limited in their capacity of identifying
   anomalies in large, dynamic and heterogeneous data, interpreting
   anomalies in their multifaceted, spatiotemporal context, and allowing
   users to provide feedback in the analysis loop. In this work, we
   introduce a unified visual interactive system and framework, Voila, for
   interactively detecting anomalies in spatiotemporal data collected from
   a streaming data source. The system is designed to meet two requirements
   in real-world applications, i.e.. online monitoring and interactivity.
   We propose a novel tensor-based anomaly analysis algorithm with
   visualization and interaction design that dynamically produces
   contextualized. interpretable data summaries and allows for
   interactively ranking anomalous patterns based on user input. Using the
   ``smart city{''} as an example scenario, we demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed framework through quantitative evaluation
   and qualitative case studies.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the irrigation water demand of green spaces (IWDG) is an
   important part of smart urban water management. However, the IWDG in
   humid cites is not well characterized. Moreover, the alteration of
   natural hydrological processes caused by urbanization leading to the
   dependence of green spaces on irrigation is becoming more common. To
   better understand the IWDG in humid areas, we developed an estimation
   model and used the Yangtze River Delta in China as a case study. Results
   showed that the amount of water required by the green spaces in the
   Yangtze River Delta was approximately 354x10(6)m(3), which was
   equivalent to 12\% of the urban residential water consumption in 2011.
   This study also investigated the spatial-temporal changes of urban green
   spaces and estimated their effects on irrigation water demand. These
   findings provide policymakers an integrated view of the water demand of
   green spaces associated with sustainable management.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{46-62}},
Abstract = {{Surveillance technologies may be capable of monitoring a domain, but
   they need a sufficiently orderly domain to monitor. This article
   examines the secretive effort to institute artificial-intelligence-based
   `smart surveillance' in the New York subway, using objectand
   pattern-recognition algorithms to identify dangerous activities in video
   feeds, such as a person abandoning a package. By considering the
   necessary preconditions for computer vision systems to recognize
   patterns and objects, I show how smart surveillance was challenged by
   the lack of visual and social uniformities necessary for smart
   surveillance systems to make its fine-toothed distinctions. In spite of
   vast resources and involvement of a major military contractor, the
   project was eventually deemed a failure. Although problems in computer
   vision are being incrementally solved, those improvements do not yet add
   up to a holistic technology capable of parsing the real-world ambiguity
   of open-ended settings which do not meet the assumptions of the
   detection algorithms. In the absence of technologies that can handle the
   actual mess, the world itself must cooperate, but it often does not. The
   article demonstrates the importance of looking beyond the claims of
   technical efficacy in the study of security and surveillance to discover
   how technologies of inspection and control actually work, as a means to
   cut through the heavy rhetorical packaging in which they are sold to
   their publics.}},

Abstract = {{This study takes a valuation perspective to study how and where products
   and innovations are gaining economic significance' in the contemporary
   economy. Building on a recent research stream in economic geography and
   urban and regional studies, it highlights that the economic value of
   many products is not formed within production systems alone, but relies
   on co-constructed connections between production and consumption
   systems, playing out across multiple geographies. It distinguishes
   between three types of economic valuation pathways - namely technical,
   experiential and identity-based - which although analytically distinct
   may actually build and reinforce one another. This approach is
   empirically illustrated with the case of the surf-related economy in the
   city of San Sebastian (Basque Country, Spain), which is used to make a
   broader point about the growing relevance of a valuation approach to
   understand competitive advantage and economic renewal in localized
   production systems.}},

   novelty and practicability}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{229-255}},
Abstract = {{Innovation comprises both novelty and practicability. These two
   dimensions of innovation correlate partly negatively in our analysis of
   survey data about planning processes in declining rural districts. As
   argued in the literature, declining regions need innovative concepts
   beyond traditional counteracting strategies to shrink smart'.
   Competitions are suggested as feasible-to-initiate innovative local
   concepts by the state. The German Federal Ministry of Food and
   Agriculture invited 39 particularly affected rural districts to
   participate in such a competition among the best concepts. We address
   the questions of how the districts dealt with the requirements for
   novelty and practicability in their concepts and how the rules of
   competitive bidding procedures influence those concepts. Answering these
   questions, we conducted a survey and statistically tested hypotheses
   deduced from governance and innovation theory. Moreover, we analysed the
   bidding documents. The results show that most districts came up with
   hardly novel and only partly practicable concepts because the
   organization of the competition, and local bargaining processes impede
   innovation. Furthermore, the ministry's requirements for the competition
   overburdened local actors with a lack of resources in declining regions.
   As a policy implication, we propose to integrate external experts in
   local networks and to accompany declining regions over a longer time
   instead of short-term competitions and projects.}},

Abstract = {{With the current availability of an extreme diversity of data sources
   and services, emerging from the Internet of Things and Cloud domains,
   the challenge is shifted towards identifying intelligent, abstracted and
   adaptive ways of correlating and combining the various levels of
   information. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate such a
   combination, on one hand at the service level, through integrating smart
   cities platforms for user level data, and on the other hand at Complex
   Event Processing, Storage and Analytics capabilities together with
   Twitter data. The final goal is to identify events of interest to the
   user such as Large Crowd Concentration (LCC) in a given area, in order
   to enrich application level information with related event
   identification that can enable more sophisticated actions on behalf of
   that user. The identification is based on observation of Twitter
   activity peaks compared to historical data on a dynamic time and
   location of interest. The approach is validated through a two-month
   experiment in the city of Madrid, identifying LCCs in sporting events
   around two sports venues and analyzing various approaches with relation

Abstract = {{Internet of Things (loT) offers a seamless platform to connect people
   and objects to one another for enriching and making our lives easier.
   This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more
   distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as
   smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this
   paper we discuss applicability of loT in healthcare and medicine by
   presenting a holistic architecture of loT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare
   is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and
   less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of
   rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this
   requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to
   patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient,
   and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This
   patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture:
   (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of
   complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This
   fog-driven loT architecture is followed by various case examples of
   services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those
   examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine,
   implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart
   cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as
   data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability,
   device-network-human interfaces, security, and privacy. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Fog Computing, a technology that takes advantage of both the paradigms
   of Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things, has a great advantage in
   reducing the communication cost. Since its introduction, fog computing
   has found a lot of applications, including, for instance, connected
   vehicles, wireless sensors, smart cities and etc. One prominent problem
   in fog computing is how fine-grained access control can be imposed.
   Functional encryption, a new cryptographic primitive, is known to
   support fine-grained access control. However, when it comes to some new
   threats in the fog computing scenario, such as side channel attacks,
   functional encryption cannot maintain its security. Therefore, we need
   new cryptographic primitives that not only provide a way to securely
   share data with a fine-grained access control but also are able to
   resist those new threats.
   In this paper, we consider how to construct functional encryption
   schemes (FEs) adaptively secure in continual memory leakage model (CML),
   which is one of the strongest models that allows continuous leakage on
   both user and master secret keys. Besides providing privacy and
   fine-grained access control in fog computing, our scheme can also
   guarantee security against side channel attacks. More concretely, we
   propose a generic framework for constructing fully secure
   leakage-resilient FEs (LR-FEs) in the CML model results from
   leakage-resilient pair encoding, which is an extension of pair encoding
   presented in the recent work of Attrapadung. In this way, our framework
   simplifies the design and analysis of LR-FEs into the design and
   analysis of predicate encodings. Moreover, we discover new adaptively
   secure LRFEs, including FE for regular languages, attribute-based
   encryption (ABE) for large universe and ABE with short ciphertext. Above
   all, leakage-resilient adaptively secure functional encryption schemes
   can equip fog computing with higher security and fine-grained access
   control. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the near future, it is envisioned that vehicular Ad hoc networks
   (VANETs) will be making use of long-distance communication techniques,
   such as cellular networks and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave
   Access (WiMAX), to get instant Internet access for making the
   communication between vehicles and fixed road side infrastructure.
   Moreover, VANETs will also make use of short-distance communication
   methods, such as Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) and
   Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) to perform short range communication between
   vehicles in an ad hoc manner. This Internet connection can provide
   facility to other vehicles to send traffic related messages, collisions,
   infotainment messages other useful safety alerts. In such a scenario,
   providing authentication between vehicle to infrastructure and vehicle
   to vehicle is a challenging task. In order to provide this facility, in
   this paper, we propose a computationally efficient privacy preserving
   anonymous authentication scheme based on the use of anonymous
   certificates and signatures for VANETs in making them an important
   component of Internet of Things (IoT) and the development of smart
   cities. Even though there are several existing schemes available to
   provide such anonymous authentication based on anonymous certificates
   and signatures in VANETs, the existing schemes suffer from high
   computational cost in the certificate revocation list (CRL) checking
   process and in the certificate and the signature verification process.
   Therefore, it is not possible to verify a large number of messages in a
   particular period in VANETs which would lead to increased message loss.
   Hence, we use a computationally efficient anonymous mutual
   authentication scheme to validate the message source as well as to
   verify the integrity of messages along with a conditional tracking
   mechanism to trace the real identity of misbehaving vehicles and revoke
   them from VANET in the case of dispute. In this paper, we also introduce
   an efficient anonymous batch authentication protocol to be used in IoT
   for Road Side Units (RSUs) to authenticate multiple vehicles
   simultaneously rather than one after the other such that the total
   authentication time can be dramatically reduced. This proposed scheme is
   implemented and the performance analysis shows that our scheme is more
   efficient in terms of certificate and signature verification cost, while
   preserving conditional privacy in VANETs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Cloud has become a very popular infrastructure for many smart city
   applications. A growing number of smart city applications from all over
   the world are deployed on the clouds. However, node failure events from
   the cloud data center have negative impact on the performance of smart
   city applications. Survivable virtual machine placement has been
   proposed by the researchers to enhance the service reliability. Because
   of the ignorance of switch failure, current survivable virtual machine
   placement approaches cannot achieve the best effect. In this paper, we
   study to enhance the service reliability by designing a novel network
   failure-aware redundant virtual machine placement approach in a cloud
   data center. Firstly, we formulate the network failure-aware redundant
   virtual machine placement problem as an integer nonlinear programming
   problem and prove that the problem is NP-hard. Secondly, we propose a
   heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. Finally, extensive simulation
   results show the effectiveness of our algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The explosive growth in the number of devices connected to the Internet
   of Things (IoT) and the exponential increase in data consumption only
   reflect how the growth of big data perfectly overlaps with that of IoT.
   The management of big data in a continuously expanding network gives
   rise to non-trivial concerns regarding data collection efficiency, data
   processing, analytics, and security. To address these concerns,
   researchers have examined the challenges associated with the successful
   deployment of IoT. Despite the large number of studies on big data,
   analytics, and IoT, the convergence of these areas creates several
   opportunities for flourishing big data and analytics for IoT systems. In
   this paper, we explore the recent advances in big data analytics for IoT
   systems as well as the key requirements for managing big data and for
   enabling analytics in an IoT environment. We taxonomized the literature
   based on important parameters. We identify the opportunities resulting
   from the convergence of big data, analytics, and IoT as well as discuss
   the role of big data analytics in IoT applications. Finally, several
   open challenges are presented as future research directions. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{The pervasive and mass-market usage of smartphones and the huge amount
   of information that those devices with their sensors can detect or
   produce are enabling novel and unforeseen smart city sensing
   opportunities through the so-called Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) paradigm.
   MCS aims to involve volunteering citizens in data sensing activities as
   they roam across the city. Notwithstanding the intense recent research
   activity in the MCS field, current MCS platforms still exhibit some
   technological limitations and do not exploit at best socio-technical
   mechanisms (e.g., economic/social incentives) to facilitate and
   encourage users' participation. In this perspective, the recent
   evolution of direct Device-to-Device (D2D) communications, in particular
   novel proximity discovery technologies, represents a relevant
   opportunity for MCS frameworks. This paper proposes a novel solution for
   improving the MCS impact and citizens' participation rate by leveraging
   LTE Direct, i.e., one of the most recent and promising technologies for
   D2D proximity discovery and local data dissemination in next generation
   5G networks. Our original MCS extension supports not only novel
   interactions with smartphones that do not necessarily host our whole MCS
   client (only an LTE Direct-enabled sensing module is required), but also
   enables new Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios where it is possible to
   extend smartphone sensing capabilities through D2D interactions with
   sensors that are dynamically determined via LTE Direct proximity
   discovery. To enable these new MCS features, we propose to expand the
   communication and data dissemination capabilities of LTE Direct via an
   original multi-frame transport protocol, capable of working properly
   also in ultra-dense scenarios with very high frame loss probability. (C)

Abstract = {{The influence of spectral irradiance on the performance of different PV
   materials-amorphous silicon, CdTe, CIS, and monocrystalline silicon-is
   studied in two cities assumed representative of mid-latitude inland
   sunny sites not affected by extreme atmospheric characteristics.
   Experimental and modelled spectral mismatch factors at different
   timescales-instantaneous, monthly, and annual-were derived from a)
   outdoor spectra recorded over a 24-month experimental campaign conducted
   in Madrid and Jaen (Spain) and b) synthetic spectra computed using
   SMARTS and input atmospheric data from AER-ONET. The experimental annual
   spectral gains presented here lie within +/- 1\% for all PV materials
   under scrutiny in both sites, in close agreement with modelled results.
   In practical terms, this may lead to simpler PV modelling approaches by
   neglecting spectral effects on an annual basis in sites with spectral
   characteristics similar to Madrid's and Jaen's. Modelled spectral
   impacts on PV performance previously reported for these two cities are
   qualitatively well aligned with our findings. Interestingly, absolute
   differences between the results regarding the annual spectral influence
   on monocrystalline silicon and CdTe in both sites obtained by means of a
   model based on satellite-based spectrally resolved irradiance data and
   the experimental results for these materials presented here stay below

Title = {{Impact of EV penetration in the interconnected urban environment of a
   smart city}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{2218-2233}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The smart city seeks a highly interconnected, monitored and globally
   optimized environment to profit from the synergies among systems such as
   energy, transports or waste management. From an energy perspective,
   transport systems and facilities are among the bigger energy consumers
   inside cities. However, despite the research available on such systems,
   few works focus on their interactions and potential synergies to
   increase their efficiencies.
   This paper address this problem by assessing the benefits of the
   interconnection and joint management of different energy systems in a
   smart city context. This is done using a linear programming problem,
   modelling a district with residential loads, distributed energy
   resources (DER) and electric vehicles (EV), which are also connected to
   an electrical metro substation. This connection allows to store the
   metro regenerative braking energy into EVs' batteries to be used later
   for other trains or for the EVs themselves. The objective of the linear
   programming model is to find the optimal planning and operation of all
   the considered systems, achieving minimum energy costs.
   Therefore, the main contributions of this paper are the assessment of
   synergies of the interconnection of these systems and the detailed
   analysis of the impact of different EV penetration levels. Results show
   important economic benefits for the overall system (up to 30\%) when the
   investments and its operation are globally optimized, especially
   reducing the metro energy costs. Also, analysing the energy transfers
   between metro-EV, it is evident that the metro takes advantages of the
   cheaper energy coming from the district (through the EVs), showing the
   existence of ``opportunistic{''} synergies. Lastly, EV saturation points
   (where extra EVs represent more load but do not provide additional
   useful storage to the system) can be relatively small (200-300 EVs) when
   the energy transfer to the metro electrical substation is restricted,
   but it is also reduced by the presence of DER systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Local climate experimentation is a topical issue as cities and rural
   municipalities are increasingly engaging in various local energy
   experiments in order to act against climate change. There are high
   expectations toward experimentation among the policy makers, hinders and
   local actors. Intermediary organisations have an important role as
   facilitators, brokers, instigators and network builders in low energy
   and low-carbon experiments. However, there is still limited
   understanding of exactly what is the work of an innovation intermediary
   in contributing to local experiments. Our paper focuses on how
   intermediaries aggregate lessons and transfer knowledge across
   experiments. We study how the intermediary activities also help in going
   beyond existing practice and make a difference beyond the experimental
   context. Our analysis is based on three empirical case studies in
   Finland: Smart Kalasatama in Helsinki, Skaftkarr in Porvoo and HINKU
   with a focus on joint purchase of solar panels. Our research shows how
   intermediaries balance diverse demands, such as immediate benefits vs.
   radical change or societal learning, in order to render local climate
   initiatives more experimental. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{In recent years, with the rapid increase in the number of mobile
   connected devices and data traffic, mobile operators have been trying to
   find solutions to provide better coverage and capacity for mobile users.
   In this respect, deployment of femtocells is a promising solution. This
   paper presents performability analysis of femtocells. Unlike the
   existing studies, the potential reduction of the service capacity due to
   failures are considered as well as various performance metrics such as
   throughput, mean queue length, response time, and energy consumption. In
   other words, the femtocells are modelled as fault tolerant wireless
   communication systems, considering factors such as mobility of the
   mobile users, multiple channels for the femtocells, and failure/repair
   behaviour of the channels for more realistic performance measures. A
   typical scenario is considered for smart-city applications as case study
   where a set of femtocells are deployed within the coverage area of a
   macrocell. The numerical results presented show the accuracy of the
   proposed model as an abstraction of a femtocell system. The results also
   reveal that the computational efficiency of the analytical model is
   significantly better than simulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Demand Reduction and Energy Savings}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Around the globe, innovation with integrating information and
   communication technologies (ICT) with physical infrastructure is a top
   priority for governments in pursuing smart, green living to improve
   energy efficiency, protect the environment, improve the quality of life,
   and bolster economy competitiveness. Cities today faces multifarious
   challenges, among which energy efficiency of homes and residential
   dwellings is a key requirement. Achieving it successfully with the help
   of intelligent sensors and contextual systems would help build smart
   cities of the future. In a Smart home environment Home Energy Management
   plays a critical role in finding a suitable and reliable solution to
   curtail the peak demand and achieve energy conservation. In this paper,
   a new method named as Home Energy Management as a Service (HEMaaS) is
   proposed which is based on neural network based Q-learning algorithm.
   Although several attempts have been made in the past to address similar
   problems, the models developed do not cater to maximize the user
   convenience and robustness of the system. In this paper, authors have
   proposed an advanced Neural Fitted Q-learning method which is
   self-learning and adaptive. The proposed method provides an agile,
   flexible and energy efficient decision making system for home energy
   management. A typical Canadian residential dwelling model has been used
   in this paper to test the proposed method. Based on analysis, it was
   found that the proposed method offers a fast and viable solution to
   reduce the demand and conserve energy during peak period. It also helps
   reducing the carbon footprint of residential dwellings. Once adopted,
   city blocks with significant residential dwellings can significantly
   reduce the total energy consumption by reducing or shifting their energy
   demand during peak period. This would definitely help local power
   distribution companies to optimize their resources and keep the tariff
   low due to curtailment of peak demand.}},

   System as Part of a Smart City Initiative}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) can be applied to inform and
   incentivize travellers to help them make cognizant choices concerning
   their trip routes and transport modality use for their daily travel
   whilst achieving more sustainable societal and transport authority
   goals. However, in practice, it is challenging for an ITS to enable
   incentive generation that is context-driven and personalized, whilst
   supporting multi-dimensional travel goals. This is because an ITS has to
   address the situation where different travellers have different travel
   preferences and constraints for route and modality, in the face of
   dynamically-varying traffic conditions. Furthermore, personalized
   incentive generation also needs to dynamically achieve different travel
   goals from multiple travellers, in the face of their conducts being a
   mix of both competitive and cooperative behaviours. To address this
   challenge, a Rule-based Incentive Framework (RIF) is proposed in this
   paper that utilizes both decision tree and evolutionary game theory to
   process travel information and intelligently generate personalized
   incentives for travellers. The travel information processed includes
   travellers' mobile patterns, travellers' modality preferences and route
   traffic volume information. A series of MATLAB simulations of RIF was
   undertaken to validate RIF to show that it is potentially an effective
   way to incentivize travellers to change travel routes and modalities as
   an essential smart city service.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) has promised a future where everything gets
   connected. Unfortunately, building a single global ecosystem of Things
   that communicate with each other seamlessly is virtually impossible
   today. The reason is that the IoT is essentially a collection of
   isolated ``Intranets of Things{''}, also referred to as ``vertical
   silos{''}, which cannot easily and efficiently interact with each other.
   Smart cities are perhaps the most striking examples of this problem
   since they comprise a wide range of stakeholders and service providers
   who must work together, including urban planners, financial
   organisations, public and private service providers, telecommunication
   providers, industries, citizens, and so forth. Within this context, the
   contribution of this paper is threefold: (i) discuss business and
   technological implications as well as challenges of creating successful
   open innovation ecosystems, (ii) present the technological building
   blocks underlying an IoT ecosystem developed in the framework of the EU
   Horizon 2020 programme, (iii) present a smart city pilot (Heat Wave
   Mitigation in Metropole de Lyon) for which the proposed ecosystem
   significantly contributes to improving interoperability between a number
   of system components, and reducing regulatory barriers for joint service
   co-creation practices.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of building information modelling (BIM) and geographic
   information system (GIS) in construction management is a new and fast
   developing trend in recent years, from research to industrial practice.
   BIM has advantages on rich geometric and semantic information through
   the building life cycle, while GIS is a broad field covering
   geovisualization-based decision making and geospatial modelling.
   However, most current studies of BIM-GIS integration focus on the
   integration techniques but lack theories and methods for further data
   analysis and mathematic modelling. This paper reviews the applications
   and discusses future trends of BIM-GIS integration in the architecture,
   engineering and construction (AEC) industry based on the studies of 96
   high-quality research articles from a spatio-temporal statistical
   perspective. The analysis of these applications helps reveal the
   evolution progress of BIM-GIS integration. Results show that the
   utilization of BIM-GIS integration in the AEC industry requires
   systematic theories beyond integration technologies and deep
   applications of mathematical modeling methods, including spatio-temporal
   statistical modeling in GIS and 4D/nD BIM simulation and management.
   Opportunities of BIM-GIS integration are outlined as three hypotheses in
   the AEC industry for future research on the in-depth integration of BIM
   and GIS. BIM-GIS integration hypotheses enable more comprehensive
   applications through the life cycle of AEC projects.}},

Abstract = {{Rapidly growing Global Positioning System (GPS) data plays an important
   role in trajectory and their applications (e.g., GPS-enabled smart
   devices). In order to employ K-means to mine the better origins and
   destinations (OD) behind the GPS data and overcome its shortcomings
   including slowness of convergence, sensitivity to initial seeds
   selection, and getting stuck in a local optimum, this paper proposes and
   focuses on a novel niche genetic algorithm (NGA) with density and noise
   for K-means clustering (NoiseClust). In NoiseClust, an improved noise
   method and K-means++ are proposed to produce the initial population and
   capture higher quality seeds that can automatically determine the proper
   number of clusters, and also handle the different sizes and shapes of
   genes. A density-based method is presented to divide the number of
   niches, with its aim to maintain population diversity. Adaptive
   probabilities of crossover and mutation are also employed to prevent the
   convergence to a local optimum. Finally, the centers (the best
   chromosome) are obtained and then fed into the K-means as initial seeds
   to generate even higher quality clustering results by allowing the
   initial seeds to readjust as needed. Experimental results based on taxi
   GPS data sets demonstrate that NoiseClust has high performance and
   effectiveness, and easily mine the city's situations in four taxi GPS
   data sets.}},

Title = {{Inferring Social Functions Available in the Metro Station Area from
   Passengers' Staying Activities in Smart Card Data}},
Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The function of a metro station area is vital for city planners to
   consider when establishing a context-aware Transit-Oriented Development
   policy around the station area. However, the functions of metro station
   areas are hard to infer using the static land use distribution and other
   traditional survey datasets. In this paper, we propose a method to infer
   the functions occurring around the metro station catchment areas
   according to the patterns of staying activities derived from smart card
   data. We first define the staying activities by the spatial and temporal
   constraints of the two consecutive alighting and boarding records from
   the individual travel profile. Then we cluster and label the whole
   staying activities by considering the features of duration, frequency,
   and start time. By analyzing the percentage of different types of
   aggregated activities happening around each metro station, we cluster
   and explore the functions of the metro station area. Taking Wuhan as a
   case study, we analyze the results of Wuhan metro systems and discuss
   the similarities and differences between the functions and the land use
   distribution around the station area. The results show that although
   there exist some agreements, there is also a gap between the human
   activities and the land uses around the station area. These findings
   could give us deeper insight into how people act around the stations by
   metro systems, which will ultimately benefit the urban planning and
   policy development.}},

Abstract = {{In the supply chain of fresh fruit and vegetables, large losses may
   incurred throughout the whole farm to fork route. Food supply chain
   management is faced with challenges of minimizing the post-harvest loss,
   while delivering the items directly to the refrigerators in smart homes
   (i.e. domotics). A substantial value can therefore be added to the
   criterion function by an immediate, real-time detection of changes in
   perishability dynamics, including a real-time calculation and
   communication of the remaining shelf life during transportation from one
   chain node to another. The changes in the estimated remaining shelf life
   can, therefore, be matched with the expected remaining transportation
   time, and so the critical moment can be avoided with a given
   probability. This can be done by dynamic rerouting in real time, based
   on previous net present value (NPV) criteria. Such criteria could then
   we include in the contractually stipulated remaining shelf life
   requirements at the delivery point
   This paper focuses on a novel concept of moving activity cells which
   represent the moving cargo between the fixed activity cells in the
   extended material requirements planning (EMRP) model. The changes in NPV
   are calculated dynamically from the expected shelf life changes. Such
   real-time calculations and early reports are enabled by the Internet of
   Things (IoT) infrastructure, where there is a smart device that tracks
   ambient conditions like temperature, humidity, and gas concentrations.
   These early estimations allow a better decision making based on
   first-expired-first-out (FEFO) cold chain management strategies for
   perishable products. Therefore, the model includes the possibility to
   deliver the items to the local market if the expected contractually
   stipulated shelf-life losses become too high. The paper does not intend
   to discuss the details of IoT or analyse different sensors, but it
   wishes to show how the EMRP theory can be used to estimate the changes
   in NPV when moving activity cells are included in the model. The smart
   measurement devices embedded in moving activity cells of cyber-physical
   system measure the ambient data and broadcast decay acceleration factors
   and postharvest loss of cargo to the decision support system. The
   numerical example shows how smart measurement devices embedded in moving
   activity cells of cyber-physical system help to reduce the post-harvest
   loss in a supply chain by rerouting when necessary. The paper
   additionally shows how much such a cyber-physical system improves NPV by
   the development of decision-making processes in the real-time, using the
   IoT as infrastructure, including automatic rerouting in postharvest
   logistics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experience applied to a public university campus
   using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate and improve the energy
   efficiency of the indoor spaces of the buildings within the limits of
   the Federal University of Piaui, considering the lighting (installed
   power and luminous flux) and air conditioning (absorbed electric power
   and cooling capacity) input/output variables. Using Brazilian energy
   efficiency evaluation methods, a comparison was made between DEA and
   Brazilian standards, with the goal of examining DEA's performance and
   feasibility in efficiency improvement. The results revealed that all of
   the analyzed university classrooms were inefficient, which is coherent
   with the classification obtained by applying Brazilian standards; the
   calculated efficiency scores for these rooms varied from 0.7182 to
   0.8477, a 0.7848 average. The DEA model, while operating in lighting and
   air conditioning systems, achieved a reduction of installed power of
   43.5\% and 22.7\%, respectively, totaling a decrease of 25.6\%, being
   able to maintain the standard characteristics of the systems mentioned.
   According to the DEA models, it was found that the generated targets
   effectively improved the efficiency of lighting and air-conditioning
   systems, reducing excessive inputs such as air conditioners' consumption
   and increasing deficient outputs such as luminous flux. It is possible
   to expand this successful application in the layout of the building in
   the whole campus area to concept small smart city projects; both have
   been achieved in the public buildings of the administrative body.
   Results from this paper revealed DEA's potential in assessing and
   optimizing the energy efficiency of buildings, improving their
   sustainability indexes, acting as a tool to support decision-making and
   benchmarking.}},

Title = {{Growing ``Smart'? Urbanization Processes in the Pune Urban Agglomeration}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Indian city of Pune witnessed rapid growth and deep transformation
   processes in the last three decades. This paper assesses past
   developments and recent structures and processes against the concept of
   urban sustainability. Following an overview of the historical
   development, the dimensions of sustainability are discussed separately,
   based on empirical findings. Urban growth puts enormous pressure on
   Pune's land and water resources, changing the ecology of the area. The
   increasing water demand of Pune's growing population competes with
   growing energy and water demands. An assessment of future climate change
   impacts indicates that the storage capacity of the reservoirs is more
   frequently not met during the rainy season. In addition, extreme dry
   years can aggravate the effects of land use change on water resources in
   the future. The city's growth and especially the large in-migration has
   also changed Pune's social fabric significantly. Wealth is distributed
   unevenly in the city and social disparities can be observed along two
   fault lines, namely along classes and caste groups. The population
   development and the increasing socioeconomic polarization are linked to
   the economic development of the city. Pune's formal economy has a robust
   base. However, as in many cities of the Global South, the informal
   economy is the most relevant source of income for large parts of the
   population. Pune's development is challenged by informality, poor
   infrastructure and inadequate planning and governance. Recently new
   approaches towards urban renewal and smart city development were
   launched. These new approaches aim at overcoming blockades in the
   traditional planning. A special challenge for urban planning is the
   transformation of urban fringe areas of the city, as this process is
   currently taking place in an unsustainable manner. The paper concludes
   that urban development has to become holistic, integrative and
   participative and should abandon the stereotype vision of the world
   class city in favor of a sustainable, locally adjusted pathway of
   development.}},

Abstract = {{To promote sustainable development, the smart city implies a global
   vision that merges artificial intelligence, big data, decision making,
   information and communication technology (ICT), and the
   internet-of-things (IoT). The ageing issue is an aspect that
   researchers, companies and government should devote efforts in
   developing smart healthcare innovative technology and applications. In
   this paper, the topic of disease diagnosis in smart healthcare is
   reviewed. Typical emerging optimization algorithms and machine learning
   algorithms are summarized. Evolutionary optimization, stochastic
   optimization and combinatorial optimization are covered. Owning to the
   fact that there are plenty of applications in healthcare, four
   applications in the field of diseases diagnosis (which also list in the
   top 10 causes of global death in 2015), namely cardiovascular diseases,
   diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, and
   tuberculosis, are considered. In addition, challenges in the deployment
   of disease diagnosis in healthcare have been discussed.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Given recent developments in information and communication technology,
   the number of individual tourists enjoying free travel without the
   advice of travel agencies is increasing. Therefore, such tourists can
   visit more tourist destinations and create more complex movement
   patterns than mass tourists. These tourist movement patterns are a key
   factor in understanding tourist behavior and they contain various
   information that is important for tourism marketers. In this vein, this
   study aims to investigate tourist movement patterns in Europe. We
   acquired 122 data points from posts on the NAVER blog, which is the most
   famous social media platform in Korea. These data were transformed into
   matrix data for social network analysis and analyzed for centrality. The
   results suggest that Korean backpackers in Europe tend to enter Europe
   through London and Paris. Venezia and Firenze are also key cities.}},

Abstract = {{As cities become increasingly complex, Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICTs) bring smartness into organisations and communities,
   contributing to a more competitive tourism destination, i.e., smart
   tourism destinations. Enhanced information access coupled with a new
   kind of tourists avid for online content and predisposed to share
   information on social media, allows for a better understanding of
   tourist behaviour regarding their spatial distribution in urban
   destinations. Thus, smart tourism portrays individuals as information
   makers, refining the available alternatives for tracking their location.
   Big data analytics is a technology with the potential to develop Smart
   City services. From the analysis of the spatial distribution of tourists
   in the city of Lisbon based on data collected from the Panoramio' social
   network, we identify the most popular places in the city in a context of
   tourist visits. This new data largely contributes to understanding the
   consumption of space within urban tourist destinations and therefore
   enables us to differentiate the overcrowded places from the ones with
   potential to grow. This allows decision-makers to imagine new ways of
   planning and managing towards a sustainable smart' future.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Over the past decade, the advent of new technology has brought about the
   emergence of smart cities aiming to provide their stakeholders with
   technology-based solutions that are effective and efficient. Insofar as
   the objective of smart cities is to improve outcomes that are connected
   to people, systems and processes of businesses, government and other
   public- and private-sector entities, its main goal is to improve the
   quality of life of all residents. Accordingly, smart tourism has emerged
   over the past few years as a subset of the smart city concept, aiming to
   provide tourists with solutions that address specific travel related
   needs. Dubai is an emerging tourism destination that has implemented
   smart city and smart tourism platforms to engage various stakeholders.
   The objective of this study is to identify best practices related to
   Dubai's smart city and smart tourism. In so doing, Dubai's mission and
   vision along with key dimensions and pillars are identified in relation
   to the advancements in the literature while highlighting key resources
   and challenges. A Smart Tourism Dynamic Responsive System (STDRS)
   framework is proposed while suggesting how Dubai may able to enhance

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article analyzes the cultural transition towards postmodernity or a
   knowledge society and its impact on the changing needs of cities. This
   transition is characterized by a growing diversification of the use of
   technologies in most of the economic, political, educational, social,
   and cultural activities of different human groups. The concept of smart
   cities emerges, in which the roles and behaviors of citizens are
   redefined in physical spaces and in their interactions, as well as the
   function of institutions and interpersonal relationships. Emerging
   models of social and cultural behavior are required to analyze and
   systematize these realities, to understand how to increase effectiveness
   in action, and to rethink education and new ways of teaching and
   learning. All these processes are based on phenomena of innovation and
   management, mediated by technology. We proposed an analysis of the new
   digital skills of these individuals. The elements that shape the
   reformulation of roles and reference models, as well as an analysis of
   the postmodern cultural changes and the formation of a holistic,
   human-community-technology vision, are based on a new pyramid of
   training needs in which technologies are placed at the service of
   people's development, organizations, society, and culture.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Over the last three decades the environmental, economic and social
   crisis and the challenges and possibilities offered by new technologies
   have become the drivers of plans and projects for sustainable cities. In
   the face of a wide experimentation, the aim of this paper is to answer
   the question: what progress is implemented by the goal of sustainable
   city? To this end, I hold it is important point at the watershed between
   the declared intended goals of the projects realized to date and the
   results on the ground. To analyze this discrepancy, I have identified a
   common theory-practice gap in the form of the three pitfalls of
   sustainable city, which bring about economic and ethical conflicts and
   risks creating socio-spatial utopias. The three pitfalls are: (1) the
   idea of the city as a business; (2) the oversimplification of urban
   complexity; (3) the quest for the ideal community. This conceptual
   framework has two purposes. First, it helps to systematize the existing
   literature on the sustainable city project, focusing on few selected
   issues. Second, it offers a project evaluation framework, useful both
   for the management of resources and for the planning of urban space. To
   pinpoint these pitfalls in projects for sustainable cities could allow
   us to adopt a holistic approach to the city project and practice.}},

Abstract = {{A considerable amount of research has addressed Internet of Things and
   connected communities. It is possible to exploit the sensing
   capabilities of connected communities, by leveraging the continuously
   growing use of cloud computing solutions and mobile devices. The
   pervasiveness of mobile sensors also enables the Mobile Crowd Sensing
   (MCS) paradigm, which aims at using mobile-embedded sensors to extend
   monitoring of multiple (environmental) phenomena in expansive urban
   areas. In this article, we discuss our approach with a cloud-based
   platform to pave the way for applying crowd sensing in urban scenarios.
   We have implemented a complete solution for environmental monitoring of
   several pollutants, like noise, air, electromagnetic fields, and so on
   in an urban area based on this paradigm. Through extensive
   experimentation, specifically on noise pollution, we show how the
   proposed infrastructure exhibits the ability to collect data from
   connected communities, and enables a seamless support of services needed
   for improving citizens' quality of life and eventually helps city
   decision makers in urban planning.}},

Abstract = {{Mobility in urban environments is an undisputed key factor that can
   affect citizens' well-being and quality of life. This is particularly
   relevant for those people with disabilities or with reduced mobility who
   have to face the presence of barriers in urban areas. In this scenario,
   the availability of information about such architectural elements
   (together with facilities) can greatly support citizens' mobility by
   enhancing their independence and their abilities in conducting daily
   outdoor activities. With this in mind, we have designed and developed
   mobile Pervasive Accessibility Social Sensing (mPASS), a system that
   provides users with personalized paths, computed on the basis of their
   own preferences and needs, with a customizable and accessible interface.
   The system collects data from crowdsourcing and crowdsensing to map
   urban and architectural accessibility by providing reliable information
   coming from different data sources with different levels of
   trustworthiness. In this context, reliability can be ensured by properly
   managing crowdsourced and crowdsensed data, combined when possible with
   authoritative datasets, provided by disability rights organizations and
   local authorities. To demonstrate this claim, in this article we present
   our trustworthiness model and discuss results we have obtained by
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Considering social, economic and demographic issues, living in the city
   implies inadequate living conditions, social exclusion, inequities and
   other problems to the population. At the same time, the city is a
   setting of cultural, social and affective production. As a result, there
   is a need to reflect on the right to the city and its relationship with
   promoting the health of its inhabitants. To that effect, urban agendas
   have been developed to address the city's ambiguity. This paper aims to
   analyze four of these agendas through the lenses of Health Promotion. A
   qualitative document review approach was conducted on urban agendas
   proposed by international organizations and applied to the Brazilian
   context: Healthy Cities, Sustainable Cities, Smart Cities and Educating
   Cities. Results indicate some level of effort by the analyzed agendas to
   assume social participation, intersectoriality and the territory as
   central to addressing exclusion and inequities. However, more in-depth
   discussions are required on each of these concepts. We conclude that
   urban agendas can contribute greatly toward consolidating the right to
   the city, provided that their underpinning concepts are critically
   comprehended.}},

Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) is connecting billions of devices to the
   Internet. These IoT devices chain sensing, computation, and
   communication techniques, which facilitates remote data collection and
   analysis. wireless sensor networks (WSN) connect sensing devices
   together on a local network, thereby eliminating wires, which generate a
   large number of samples, creating a big data challenge. This IoT
   paradigm has gained traction in recent years, yielding extensive
   research from an increasing variety of perspectives, including
   scientific reviews. These reviews cover surveys related to IoT vision,
   enabling technologies, applications, key features, co-word and cluster
   analysis, and future directions. Nevertheless, we lack an IoT
   scientometrics review that uses scientific databases to perform a
   quantitative analysis. This paper develops a scientometric review about
   IoT over a data set of 19,035 documents published over a period of 15
   years (2002-2016) in two main scientific databases (Clarivate Web of
   Science and Scopus). A Python script called ScientoPy was developed to
   perform quantitative analysis of this data set. This provides insight
   into research trends by investigating a lead author's country
   affiliation, most published authors, top research applications,
   communication protocols, software processing, hardware, operating
   systems, and trending topics. Furthermore, we evaluate the top trending
   IoT topics and the popular hardware and software platforms that are used
   to research these trends.}},

Abstract = {{The large demand of bandwidth due to new and future applications from
   services being implemented such as smart grid (SG), smart cities (SC),
   and the Internet of Things has triggered a focus of interest from the
   scientific community on issues related to the planning and scalability
   of the communications infrastructure. In this paper, we present three
   new and important contributions regarding the deployment of FiWi
   networks that support users who benefit from the services provided by SG
   and SC. We first propose a planning model, and then formulate a mixed
   linear programming optimization model using multistage stochastic
   programming, and finally propose an algorithm, called MOA-FiWi, which
   has the capacity to handle medium and large instances of the problem and
   give feasible solutions for the optimization process, where scalability
   indices between 85\%-95\% are reached with respect to the projected
   stochastic values. The proposed model considers the scalability and
   capital and operating expense, as well as the uncertainty management in
   the different stages of time-space through multistage stochastic
   programming. The proposed model presents flexibility in decision making
   as the time stages progress. This allows for the planning of green
   fields, as well as the updating of networks that already have
   communication infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of pervasive intelligent devices and
   ubiquitous network technologies, new network applications are emerging,
   such as the Internet of Things, smart cities, smart grids,
   virtual/augmented reality, and unmanned vehicles. Cloud computing, which
   is characterized by centralized computation and storage, is having
   difficulty meeting the needs of these developing technologies and
   applications. In recent years, a variety of network computing paradigms,
   such as fog computing, mobile edge computing, and dew computing, have
   been proposed by the industrial and academic communities. Although they
   employ different terminologies, their basic concept is to extend cloud
   computing and move the computing infrastructure from remote data centers
   to edge routers, base stations, and local servers located closer to
   users, thereby overcoming the bottlenecks experienced by cloud computing
   and providing better performance and user experience. In this paper, we
   systematically summarize and analyze the post-cloud computing paradigms
   that have been proposed in recent years. First, we summarize the main
   bottlenecks of technology and application that cloud computing
   encounters. Next, we analyze and summarize several post-cloud computing
   paradigms, including fog computing, mobile edge computing, and dew
   computing. Then, we discuss the development opportunities of post-cloud
   computing via several examples. Finally, we note the future development
   prospects of post-cloud computing.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{This study uses Hazard-based duration modelling methods to investigate
   commute patterns of males and females, with the aim of exploring the
   variability of commute times and modes over a period of nine years
   beginning in 2003. Securing two major datasets of the UK National Travel
   Survey (NTS) and Tyne and Wear household travel survey, as well as the
   level of detail that the chosen datasets offer, made it possible to
   ascertain the complexity of commuter travel at its fundamental level.
   Duration models have been very popular when analysing duration related
   activities. However, duration modelling research in the context of
   transport so far has been restricted to cross sectional one-off
   datasets. This is the first study that investigates commuting durations
   at a disaggregate level over a sustained period of nine years using
   duration modelling methods to acquire a fundamental understanding of the
   changes in commute durations. Gender aspects as well as the transport
   modes, including non-motorised transport (NMT), car and public transport
   (PT), were also addressed in the analysis. Probability density functions
   (PDFs), survival functions (S(f)) and hazard functions (H(f) were
   employed when carrying out in-depth investigations into the patterns of
   commuting activities generated by males and females for the whole period
   of study over nine years, followed by year on year analysis. The
   descriptive analysis shows that commuting times are becoming longer as
   time goes by. Year on year analysis reveals that commute trips by car
   made by males are more likely to prevail in the system compared to PT,
   especially towards the end of the study period in 2010-11. The opposite
   is true for female commuting trips. NMT was an attractive mode for both
   males and females in 2009-10 even for longer commute trip durations of
   over 50 min. As the complexity of the activity travel patterns of males
   and females has not been given adequate attention in previous research)
   this study made a step forward in investigating the gender aspects, with
   specific attention being given to the differences in commute times.
   Transport authorities' and policy makers' timely interventions, such as
   quality bus partnerships, cycle city guides, and cycle to work schemes,
   as well as Metro system reinvigorations, including smart ticketing, have
   been taken into account when rationalizing the results and the changes
   to commute times over the study period.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things has been applied in many fields, especially in
   smart cities. The failure of nodes brings a significant challenge to the
   robustness of topologies. The IoT of smart cities is increasingly
   producing a vast amount different types of data, which includes the
   node's geographic information, neighbor list, sensing data, and so on.
   Thus, how to improve the robustness of topology against malicious
   attacks based on big data of smart cities becomes a critical issue. To
   tackle this problem, this article proposes an approach to improve the
   robustness of network topology based on a multi-population genetic
   algorithm (MPGA). First, the geographic information and neighbor list of
   nodes are extracted from a big data server. Then a novel MPGA with a
   crossover operator and a mutation operator is proposed to optimize the
   robustness of topology. Our algorithm keeps the initial degree of each
   node unchanged such that the optimized topology will not increase the
   energy cost of adding edges. The extensive experiment results show that
   our algorithm can significantly improve the robustness of topologies
   against malicious attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Lately, with the prevalence of digital devices and social network
   applications, the explosive growth of multimedia big data poses many
   challenges for users to obtain them securely in various application
   scenarios. In this article, investigating secure multimedia big data
   application in trust-assisted sensor cloud (TASC), which is one kind of
   SC for smart city, the recent work about multimedia big data and SC is
   reviewed first. Further, the critical issues that affect the success of
   secure multimedia big data in TASC are identified. With that, motivated
   by addressing the identified critical issues, this article proposes two
   types of TASC: TASC-S (TASC with a single trust value threshold), and
   TASC-M (TASC with multiple trust value thresholds). Finally, with
   extensive simulation results about TASC-S and TASC-M as well as SC
   without trust assistance (SCWTA), the following insights into secure
   multimedia big data in TASC are achieved: the throughput of TASC-S and
   TASC-M can both be generally higher than that of SCWTA; the throughput
   of TASC-S can trend with tuned trust value threshold; and the throughput
   of TASC-M can fluctuate with the same trust value thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{With advanced ICT, the ever- rapid development of informatization has
   become an integral part of smart city services in healthcare,
   transportation, energy, education, business, community life, and so on.
   A huge amount of data, called big data, is generated from various
   sources, and effective analysis and utilization of big data has become a
   key factor in the success of smart city services. However, in order to
   achieve precise big data analytics and make real-time decisions, one of
   the challenging issues is how to efficiently deliver the huge amounts of
   collected data to the processing servers. In this article, we first
   propose a novel architecture to support smart city services based on SDN
   technology. Then we study the time-constrained big data transfer
   scheduling (TBTS) problem under the proposed architecture, and present
   an intelligent strategy to address the TBTS issue by utilizing the SDN
   controller to conduct dynamic flow control and multi-path transfer
   scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy
   can efficiently support big data transfer in terms of low transfer delay
   and high bandwidth utilization.}},

Abstract = {{As vehicle applications, mobile devices and the Internet of Things are
   growing fast, and developing an efficient architecture to deal with the
   big data in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has been an important concern
   for the future smart city. To overcome the inherent defect of
   centralized data processing in cloud computing, fog computing has been
   proposed by offloading computation tasks to local fog servers (LFSs). By
   considering factors like latency, mobility, localization, and
   scalability, this article proposes a regional cooperative
   fog-computing-based intelligent vehicular network (CFC-IoV) architecture
   for dealing with big IoV data in the smart city. Possible services for
   IoV applications are discussed, including mobility control, multi-source
   data acquisition, distributed computation and storage, and multi-path
   data transmission. A hierarchical model with intra-fog and inter-fog
   resource management is presented, and energy efficiency and packet
   dropping rates of LFSs in CFC-IoV are optimized.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important goals of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) in
   smart cities is the efficient management of accidents, specially to
   prevent them. Our research lies on a promising smart service, which soon
   might be available in our cities. After the occurrence of an accident, a
   vehicle couldmake a light and short video of the situation and send it
   through the VANET till reaching an access point in the infrastructure of
   the city to alert the emergencies service (e.g., 911 or 112). With a
   video message, the level of seriousness of the accident could be better
   interpreted by the authorities (i.e., health care unit, police,
   ambulance drivers) than with a simple text message. In this way,
   vehicles could participate in reporting a situation in the city using
   the ad hoc network so it would be possible to have a quick reaction of
   the emergency units and even prevent further accidents. The deployment
   of an efficient routing protocol to manage video-reporting messages in
   VANETs has important benefits by enabling a fast warning of the
   incident, which potentially might save lives. To contribute with this
   goal, we propose a multimedia multimetric map-aware routing protocol to
   provide video-reporting messages over VANETs in smart cities.
   Furthermore, a realistic scenario is created by using real maps with
   SUMO including buildings that may interfere the signal between sender
   and receiver. Also, we use our REVsim tool that allows vehicles to avoid
   choosing vehicles behind buildings to be chosen as next forwarding
   nodes. Simulations show the benefits of our proposal, taking into
   account the mobility of the nodes and the presence of interfering
   buildings.}},

Abstract = {{Connected and autonomous vehicles will play a pivotal role in future
   intelligent transportation systems and smart cities, in general.
   High-speed and low-latency wireless communication links will allow
   municipalities to warn vehicles against safety hazards, as well as
   support cloud-driving solutions to drastically reduce traffic jams and
   air pollution. To achieve these goals, vehicles need to be equipped with
   a wide range of sensors generating and exchanging high rate data
   streams. Recently, millimeter wave (mm Wave) techniques have been
   introduced as a means of fulfilling such high data rate requirements. In
   this paper, we model a highway communication network and characterize
   its fundamental link budget metrics. In particular, we specifically
   consider a network where vehicles are served by mm Wave base stations
   (BSs) deployed alongside the road. To evaluate our highway network, we
   develop a new theoretical model that accounts for a typical scenario
   where heavy vehicles (such as buses and lorries) in slow lanes obstruct
   line-of-sight (LOS) paths of vehicles in fast lanes and, hence, act as
   blockages. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive
   approximations for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise Ratio (SINR)
   outage probability, as well as the probability that a user achieves a
   target communication rate (rate coverage probability). Our analysis
   provides new design insights for mmWave highway communication networks.
   In considered highway scenarios, we show that reducing the horizontal
   beam width from 90 degrees to 30 degrees determines a minimal reduction
   in the SINR outage probability (namely 4. 10(-2) at maximum). Also,
   unlike bidimensional mmWave cellular networks, for small BS densities
   (namely one BS every 500 m) it is still possible to achieve an SINR
   outage probability smaller than 0.2.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this study was to investigate the bikesharing
   travel patterns and trip purposes by combining smart card data and
   online point of interests (POIs). A large-scale smart card trip data was
   collected from the bikesharing system in New York City. The POIs
   surrounding each station were obtained from Google Places API. K-means
   clustering analysis was first applied to divide bikesharing stations
   into five types based on their surrounding POIs. The Latent Dirichlet
   Allocation (LDA) analysis was then conducted to discover the hidden
   bikesharing travel patterns and trip purposes using the identified
   station types and smart card data. The performance of the LDA models
   with and without POI data was compared to identify whether the POI data
   should be used. Finally, a practical application of the proposed methods
   in bikesharing planning and operation was discussed. The result of
   comparative analyses verified the importance of POI data in exploring
   bikesharing travel patterns and trip purposes. The results of LDA model
   showed that the most prevalent travel purpose in New York City is taking
   public bike for eating, followed by shopping and transferring to other
   public transit systems. In addition, the result also suggested that
   people living around the bikesharing stations are more likely to
   transfer to other commuting tools on the morning peak and ride for home
   after work. The proposed methods can be used to provide useful guidance
   and suggestions for transportation agency to develop strategies and
   regulation that aim at improving the operations of bikesharing systems.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of zones and people's movement patterns supports a better
   understanding of modern cities and enables a more comprehensive strategy
   for urban planning. This article proposes a modified method based on
   previous research to simultaneously discover people's zones and movement
   patterns, called movement patterns between functional zones (MPFZ). The
   method attempts to take full advantage of taxi GPS data to identify
   MPFZs by merging the movement traces satisfying the merging conditions.
   Considering movement directions, movement numbers and the adjacent
   constraints that consist of spatial relationship and attribute features,
   the merging conditions limit the movement traces to be merged. The new
   MPFZs are discovered by an iteration process and are measured by the
   following three evaluation indices: v-value, a-value and c-value, which
   represent coverage, accuracy and their trade-off. Using a real-world
   taxi dataset of Beijing, 24 new MPFZs are discovered, which have higher
   v-, a- and c-values than the unmerged MPFZs. The results of the
   real-world dataset experiment show that the proposed approach is
   effective and efficient. The proposed method can also be applied to
   other types of transportation data and regions by adjusting the dataset
   utilized and controlling the iteration process.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic lights (TLs) are used to control traffic at road intersections.
   Typically, the TL control mechanism on the road operates according to a
   fixed periodic schedule to change the light (red/yellow/green). A
   different schedule may be employed at late night or early morning hours.
   Such fixed light control does not react to changing traffic conditions,
   and is unaware of (unresponsive to) congestion. In this paper, we
   propose a novel framework dynamic TL control (DTLC) at road
   intersections. DTLC relies on a sensor network to collect traffic data
   and includes novel protocols to handle congestion and facilitate more
   efficient traffic flow. The proposed low-overhead algorithms are
   practical to employ in live traffic flow scenarios. Through analysis and
   simulations, we demonstrate the benefits of DTLC in optimizing traffic
   flow metrics, such as traffic throughput, vehicle waiting time, and
   waiting line length. This paper is a step toward employing smart TLs,
   which are part of the future envisioned ``Smart City.{''}}},

Abstract = {{Considering the increase of urban population and traffic congestion,
   smart parking is always a strategic issue to work on, not only in the
   research field, but also from economic interests. Thanks to information
   and communication technology evolution, drivers can more efficiently
   find satisfying parking spaces with smart parking services. The existing
   and ongoing works on smart parking are complicated and
   transdisciplinary. While deploying a smart parking system, cities, as
   well as urban engineers, need to spend a very long time to survey and
   inspect all the possibilities. Moreover, many varied works involve
   multiple disciplines, which are closely linked and inseparable. To give
   a clear overview, we introduce a smart parking ecosystem and propose a
   comprehensive and thoughtful classification by identifying their
   functionalities and problematic focuses. We go through the literature
   over the period of 2000-2016 on parking solutions as they were applied
   to smart parking development and evolution, and propose three
   macro-themes: information collection, system deployment, and service
   dissemination. In each macro-theme, we explain and synthesize the main
   methodologies used in the existing works and summarize their common
   goals and visions to solve current parking difficulties. Finally, we
   give our engineering insights and show some challenges and open issues.
   Our survey gives an exhaustive study and a prospect in a
   multidisciplinary approach. Besides, the main findings of the current
   state-of-the-art throw out recommendations for future research on smart
   cities and the Internet architecture.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a thorough literature review of current
   state-of-the-art systems analysis techniques for urban solid waste
   collection and identifies four intrinsic deficiencies of the existing
   studies over different types of cities. As a demonstration, a
   multiconstrained and multicompartment routing problem is modeled with
   roll-on roll-off scheduling strategies in a two-stage decision-making
   process to exhibit the highest complexity of its kind in practical
   implementation. The constraints of time windows, intermediate
   facilities, multishifts, and split deliveries make an ideal combination
   of all essential complexities in modeling practices. To overcome the
   relevant challenges, a unified heuristic algorithm is proposed for
   addressing node routing and roll-on roll-off routing problems. The
   proposed heuristic algorithm that concatenates initialization and
   improvement phases solves the models with numerical efficiency to search
   for the most cost-effective and environmentally benign solutions.
   Results indicate that differentiated collection increases opportunities
   to pursue the best routing strategies with sustainable implications
   through sensitivity analysis at the expense of higher collection costs.
   The analysis concludes with the perspectives of a smart and green waste
   collection system designed to create a more sustainable waste management
   systems in the future.}},

Title = {{Benchmarking real-time vehicle data streaming models for a smart city}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{62-76}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The information systems of smart cities offer project developers,
   institutions, industry and experts the possibility to handle massive
   incoming data from diverse information sources in order to produce new
   information services for citizens. Much of this information has to be
   processed as it arrives because a real-time response is often needed.
   Stream processing architectures solve this kind of problems, but
   sometimes it is not easy to benchmark the load capacity or the
   efficiency of a proposed architecture. This work presents a real case
   project in which an infrastructure was needed for gathering information
   from drivers in a big city, analyzing that information and sending
   real-time recommendations to improve driving efficiency and safety on
   roads. The challenge was to support the real-time recommendation service
   in a city with thousands of simultaneous drivers at the lowest possible
   cost. In addition, in order to estimate the ability of an infrastructure
   to handle load, a simulator that emulates the data produced by a given
   amount of simultaneous drivers was also developed. Experiments with the
   simulator show how recent stream processing platforms like Apache Kafka
   could replace custom-made streaming servers in a smart city to achieve a
   higher scalability and faster responses, together with cost reduction.

Abstract = {{Cultural heritage applications within smart city environments are
   becoming extremely popular to public authorities. The success of such
   applications lies on several factors like user-friendliness and data
   presentation as well as the amount and accuracy of cultural data they
   can offer to users, static or mobile, on-demand. This paper presents the
   design and implementation of a multipurpose, multidiscipline digital
   platform that manages, preserves and disseminates tangible and
   intangible cultural heritage information, in a trustworthy manner,
   appropriate for the everyday use in smart city digital environments.
   Platform's trustworthiness is mainly ensured by applying specific
   authorization mechanisms based on an extended role-based access control
   scheme. The platform integrates a mobile services module that can host
   and support smartphone applications for the direct collection,
   digitization and dissemination of cultural heritage content. Moreover,
   we make an attempt to address various stakeholders who benefit from such
   a platform. In this direction we have designed and implemented a series
   of real life usage scenarios. The proposed platform is evaluated against
   other online digital platforms that host cultural heritage content.
   Evaluation results suggest that the presented platform could become a
   participatory system that targets not only experts and artists, but also
   amateurs and enthusiasts of cultural heritage. This vast and
   heterogeneous user base could be the only feasible way to support
   data-hungry ecosystems like smart city digital environments, by
   providing cultural information at any time and place.}},

   knowledge-making are argued to be the shifts in social power relations,
   particular spatial and material practices, and the participant
   assemblage. These components intra-act transferring our understanding on
   ageing: ageing becomes a creative state where the seniors are included
   in the problem-solving instead of being citizens to be looked after, and
   thus being merely a socio-economic problem. The power dynamics are
   essential in participatory action research, therefore, the

Abstract = {{With the ubiquity of low-powered technologies and devices in the urban
   environment operating in every area of human activity, the development
   and integration of a low-energy harvester suitable for smart cities
   applications is indispensable. The multitude of low-energy applications
   extend from wireless sensors, data loggers, transmitters and other
   small-scale electronics. These devices function in the
   microWatt-milliWatt power range and will play a significant role in the
   future of smart cities providing power for extended operation with
   little or no battery dependence. This study thus aims to investigate the
   potential built environment integration and energy harvesting
   capabilities of the Wind-Induced Flutter Energy Harvester (WIFEH)- a
   microgenerator aimed to provide energy for low-powered applications.
   Low-energy harvesters such as the WIFEH are suitable for integration
   with wireless sensors and other small-scale electronic devices; however,
   there is a lack in study on this type of technology's building
   integration capabilities. Hence, there is a need for investigating its
   potential and optimal installation conditions.
   This work presents the experimental investigation of the WIFEH inside a
   wind tunnel and a case study using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
   modelling of a building integrated with a WIFEH system. The experiments
   tested the WIFEH under various wind tunnel airflow speeds ranging from
   2.3 to 10 m/s to evaluate the induced electromotive force generation
   capability of the device. The simulation used a gable-roof type building
   model with a 27 pitch obtained from the literature. The atmospheric
   boundary layer (ABL) flow was used for the simulation of the approach
   wind. The work investigates the effect of various wind speeds and WIFEH
   locations on the performance of the device giving insight on the
   potential for integration of the harvester into the built environment.
   The WIFEH was able to generate an RMS voltage of 3 V, peak-to-peak
   voltage of 8.72 V and short-circuit current of linA when subjected to
   airflow of 2.3 m/s. With an increase of wind velocity to 5 m/s and
   subsequent membrane retensioning, the RMS and peak-to-peak voltages and
   short-circuit current also increase to 4.88 V, 18.2 V, and 3.75 mA,
   respectively. For the CFD modelling integrating the WIFEH into a
   building, the apex of the roof of the building yielded the highest power
   output for the device due to flow speed-up maximisation in this region.
   This location produced the largest power output under the 45 angle of
   approach, generating an estimated 62.4 mW of power under accelerated
   wind in device position of up to 6.2 m/s. For wind velocity (UH) of 10
   m/s, wind in this position accelerated up to approximately 14.4 m/s
   which is a 37.5\% speed-up at the particular height. This occurred for
   an oncoming wind 30 relative to the building facade. For UH equal to 4.7
   m/s under 0 wind direction, airflows in facade edges were the fastest at
   5.4 m/s indicating a 15\% speed-up along the edges of the building. (C)

Abstract = {{Within the realm of smart buildings and smart cities, dynamic response
   management is playing an ever-increasing role, thus attracting the
   attention of scientists from different disciplines. Dynamic demand
   response management involves a set of operations aiming at
   decentralizing the control of loads in large and complex power networks.
   Each single appliance is fully responsive and readjusts its energy
   demand to the overall network load. A main issue is related to mains
   frequency oscillations resulting from an unbalance between supply and
   demand. In a nutshell, this paper contributes to the topic by equipping
   each consumer with strategic insight. In particular, we highlight three
   main contributions and a few other minor contributions. First, we design
   a mean-field game for a population of thermostatically controlled loads,
   study the mean-field equilibrium for the deterministic mean-field game,
   and investigate on asymptotic stability for the microscopic dynamics.
   Second, we extend the analysis and design to uncertain models, which
   involve both stochastic or deterministic disturbances. This leads to
   robust mean-field equilibrium strategies guaranteeing stochastic and
   worst-case stability, respectively. Minor contributions involve the use
   of stochastic control strategies rather than deterministic and some
   numerical studies illustrating the efficacy of the proposed strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the recurring problem of node redundancy in
   Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In addition to categorizing redundancy
   into different types, comprehensively formulating and representing
   redundancy as a dynamic matter as well as estimating it with a new
   analytical method, we propose an approach where sensors are competing
   for the identification and relocation of redundant sensors. In our
   approach, sensors with low redundancy weights force neighboring peers
   with high redundancy weights to relocate or go to sleep according to a
   bully strategy. To increase their chances of winning their individual
   competitions (also called micro competition), redundant sensors are
   allowed to use the support of close peers belonging to the same cluster,
   leading thereby to a macro competition. We extend our solutions to the
   scenario of charging electrical vehicles in a Smart City context. We,
   indeed, found that the charging stations, with their varying
   capabilities and schedules, are competing to provide redundant charging
   services to the moving electrical vehicles in a scenario very similar to
   sensor redundancy. Our aim is then to identify the extent of service
   redundancy to ultimately provide the right charging service, at the
   right location, at the right time, to the right electrical vehicle. We,
   therefore, mainly focus on proposing a mathematical formal model
   reflecting the competition of charging stations to support the requests
   of electrical vehicles. Our ongoing simulations with the ns3 tool are
   showing promising results.}},

Title = {{EnergIoT: A solution to improve network lifetime of IoT devices}},
Journal = {{PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{124-133}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm attracting significant
   attention in the modern wireless telecommunications field. However, in
   some scenarios, the performance of IoT network is limited by
   energy-constrained devices. In order to improve the energy efficiency of
   such IoT devices, researchers have proposed several approaches based on
   duty cycle operation (switching devices between sleeping and active
   mode). However, current solutions adopting duty cycle (i.e., the
   fraction of time in which a node is active) have three issues: (i) they
   assign the same duty cycle ratio to all the nodes without balancing
   energy consumption; or (ii) they distribute different duty cycle ratios
   without considering the energy consumption during network construction
   phase; or (iii) their network structure models are based on concentric
   corona, instead of clustering structure.
   In this paper, we propose EnergIoT, a hierarchical clustering approach
   based on duty cycle ratio to maximize network lifetime of
   battery-powered IoT devices. In particular, we assign different duty
   cycle ratios to devices according to their distance from the sink, since
   different duty cycle ratios balance the energy consumption among devices
   at different layers. Furthermore, we calculate the energy consumption of
   IoT devices, considering both network construction phase and data
   processing phase. We evaluate EnergIoT through extensive simulation
   analyses on the OMNet++ platform. The result shows that EnergIoT is not
   only feasible but also efficient. Moreover, EnergIoT improves the
   network lifetime by 32\%, compared to the uniform duty cycle approach,
   without sacrificing the network performance (i.e., end-to-end delay).

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things has enabled new services to communities in many
   domains, e.g. smart healthcare, environmental awareness, and public
   safety. These services require timely and accurate event delivery, but
   such in-situ deployments are often limited by the coverage of
   sensing/communication infrastructures. In this paper we develop
   effective, scalable, and realistic data collection and upload solutions
   using mobile data collectors in community IoT systems. Specifically, we
   address the optimized upload planning problem, i.e. determine the
   optimal schedule for communication to enable timely data delivery under
   dynamicity in network connectivity, data characteristics/heterogeneity,
   and mobility. We develop a two-phase approach and associated policies,
   where an initial upload plan is generated offline with prior knowledge
   of networks and data, and a subsequent runtime adaptation alters the
   plan under multiple dynamics. To validate our approach, we designed and
   built SCALECycle, our mobile data collection platform, and deployed it
   in real communities in Rockville, MD and Irvine, CA. Measurements from
   these testbeds are used to drive extensive simulations. Experimental
   results indicate that compared with opportunistic operation, our
   two-phase approach using a judicious combination of policies can result
   in 30\%-60\% improvement in overall data utility, 30\% reduction in
   collection delays, along with greater resilience to dynamicity and
   improved scalability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The past decade has witnessed an explosion of interest in smart cities
   in which a set of applications, such as smart healthcare, smart
   lighting, and smart transportation promise to drastically improve the
   quality and efficiency of these services. The skeleton of these
   applications is formed by a network of distributed sensors that captures
   data, pre-processes, and transmits it to a center for further
   processing. While these sensors are generally perceived to be a wireless
   network of sensing devices that are deployed permanently as part of an
   application, the emerging mobile crowd-sensing (MCS) concept prescribes
   a drastically different platform for sensing; a network of smartphones,
   owned by a volunteer crowd, can capture, pre-process, and transmit the
   data to the same center. We call these two forms of sensors dedicated
   and non-dedicated sensors in this paper. While dedicated sensors imply
   higher deployment and maintenance costs, the MCS concept also has known
   implementation challenges, such as incentivizing the crowd and ensuring
   the trustworthiness of the captured data, and covering a wide sensing
   area. Due to the pros/cons of each option, the decision as to which one
   is better becomes a non-trivial answer. In this paper, we conduct a
   thorough study of both types of sensors and draw conclusions about which
   one becomes a favourable option based on a given application platform.}},

Abstract = {{This paper initiates a discussion on the application of the graph signal
   processing to exploration of complex and heterogeneous data and systems,
   and especially for the case of environmental monitoring in smart habitat
   of city, country, and continent. This emerging approach relates to the
   objects, which can be represented by a networked structure, but enables
   also the reconstruction of network-like associations from data when this
   kind of structured organization is not apparent. In this paper, the
   sensor network is perceived as the fundamental layer of the smart
   habitat, and inference is provided not only by direct operation on
   acquired signals, but also network model is identified for recorded
   ozone (O-3) data in 100 measurement points deployed in Poland. It means
   that a graph as a mathematical representation of the complex network is
   generated, which links system features and behaviors coded in measured
   data sets. Results of multiscale projections are commented for ozone
   data sets. Furthermore, in opposite to the classical signal processing,
   the spectral analysis for graph signals is demonstrated, including
   reconstruction of graph Laplacian and Fourier transform calculation for
   signals spanned on graph vertices. Finally, local (related to the
   location of sensor in network) properties and behaviors are clustered
   based on spectral maps generated for graph signals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the camera placement problem for smart cities in

   about the quantization of surveillance target and camera locations into
   discrete grid points and the setting of the weights of target grid
   points. We then present the visibility analysis with field of view in
   consideration of occlusions and different camera specifications. Based
   on these characteristics and constraints, we formulate the camera
   placement problem and propose a new heuristic algorithm called
   collaboration-based local search algorithm, which incorporates the local
   search into collaborative allocation. We evaluate the performance of the
   proposed algorithm in comparison with the greedy algorithm, binary
   genetic algorithm, and binary particle swarm optimization through
   simulation experiments with small and large problem sets. The simulation
   results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the three existing
   algorithms in terms of the average weighted coverage rate and

Abstract = {{Commonly, illumination systems require a huge amount of energy at night.
   In particular, in areas with a low frequency of pedestrians and
   automobiles, a large amount of power is wasted. This paper presents a
   new deterministic model to control street illumination depending on
   traffic needs for improving energy efficiency. The light on demand (LoD)
   system incorporates the traffic velocity into the model and generates
   results that are more relevant to real-time traffic needs while ensuring
   safety and security. The saving potential of a road using LoD, smart
   lighting or automated illumination can be checked easily. This paper is
   relevant for smart city applications. This paper complies a real
   implementation and a Simulink (R) test as a proof of concept. As a
   result, possible energy savings and real-time demands can be examined
   for street, parking or indoor areas. An extrema analysis proves optimal
   energy savings in dependence of traffic velocity. The impact on energy
   savings and real-time demands is analyzed in relation to velocity,
   junctions, traffic volume, dimming level, and dimming profile gradients.
   A comparison with other publications demonstrates the highest savings of
   the developed model. Furthermore, wireless sensor network systems even

Abstract = {{Provision for unrestricted movement by everybody, including disabled
   people, is among the basic aims of a Smart City. In this paper, we deal
   with human indoor navigation based on inertial sensors that are commonly
   found in devices, such as smartphones. The approach has gathered broad
   interest within the scientific community, since it does not require
   installation of external devices and allows the use of a smartphone both
   as measurement platform and user interface. Thus, it can be seen as an
   inclusive low-cost, low-energy human navigation aid. We focus this paper
   on the implementation of algorithms for estimating and tracking the
   heading direction of a user walking within a structured environment,
   e.g., a building. The main feature of the proposed method is that the
   estimation of direction is not referred to absolute headings based on
   the four cardinal directions, as usually done in the literature. To
   achieve sufficient reliability and, at the same time, preserve
   simplicity, our approach is based on detecting relative changes in the
   user direction with respect to a reference system obtained during an
   initial calibration phase. The fundamental direction, which exhibits the
   minimum distance with respect to the raw measured values, is then
   provided as output. Experimental results reported in this paper show
   that a user path can be traced with sufficient accuracy within four
   steps in the worst case.}},

Abstract = {{High costs of urban services, namely, waterworks, transportation, waste
   collection, wastewater collection and treatment, energy, and public
   lighting, require their optimization in management. This optimization
   can be mostly achieved using dedicated technology and strategy by
   ``building{''} smart cities and smart grids. This paper illustrates
   findings related to the application of a designed distributed edge
   computing system for supervising a network of sensors, located on a
   special configuration of a pipeline, to detect leaks. The plant to be
   supervised is a zigzag waterworks with leaks to be simulated by opening
   and closing taps. The pressure variation is detected by magnetic
   sensors, which convert pressure variation into electric signal to be
   processed on-line thanks to an advanced and robust algorithm called a
   filter diagonalization method that performs a spectral analysis. In this
   paper, we have also developed a 2-D representation of the leak within
   the pipeline or waterworks, which is a robust way to see the dimensions
   or the expansion of the leak in a specific space.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced metering infrastructures (AMIs) are thought to deliver services
   to both citizens and utility companies in smart city context. All
   services are based on battery powered terminal devices (smart meters),
   which get to the internet through suitable gateways. Smart meters are
   usually featured with radio frequency short range antennas and must be
   within the coverage range of at least one gateway. The economic
   sustainability of the AMIs depends on the right compromise between the
   number of necessary gateways and the lifetime of terminal device
   battery. In this paper a novel method based on statistical treatment of
   the received signal strength indication value is proposed to address the
   problem of the remote management of the smart meter transmission power.
   On the basis of an estimate of signal quality, it allows the
   transmission power to be regulated with the aim of assuring both low
   transmission error rates and battery capacity saving.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{City planners, urban innovators and researchers are increasingly working
   on `future city' initiatives to investigate the physical, social and
   political aspects of harmonized urban living. Despite this,
   sustainability principles and the importance of urban groundwater are
   lacking in future city visions. Using London as a case study, the
   importance of groundwater for cities is highlighted and a range of
   future city interventions may impact on groundwater are reviewed. Using
   data from water resource plans and city planning strategies, changes in
   the groundwater balance which may occur as a result of city
   interventions are calculated for two future city scenarios: a
   `strategic' future informed by organisational policy and an
   `aspirational' future guided by sustainability principles. For London,
   under a strategic future, preferential investment in industry-scale
   technologies such as wastewater treatment and groundwater storage would
   occur. Acknowledgement that behaviour change offers the potential for a
   faster rate of transformation than innovation technologies is ignored.
   The capacity of community-led action and smart-home technologies to
   deliver sustainable water use under an aspirational future is evident,
   with a measurable impact on urban groundwater. These methods may be used
   to inform city interventions that consider the social context in
   addition to environmental constraints and business drivers.}},

Abstract = {{The recent growth and expansion in the field of Internet of Things (IoT)
   is providing a great business prospective in the direction of the new
   era of smart urban. The insight of the smart urban is extensively
   preferred, as it improves the excellence of life of citizens, connecting
   several regulations, that is, smart transportation, smart parking, smart
   environment, smart healthcare, and so forth. Continuous intensification
   of the multifaceted urban set-up is extensively challenged by real-time
   processing of data and smart decision capabilities. Consequently, in
   this paper, we propose a smart city architecture which is based on Big
   Data analytics. The proposed scheme is comprised of three modules: (1)
   data acquisition and aggregation module collects varied and diverse data
   interrelated to city services, (2) data computation and processing
   module performs normalization, filtration, processing and data analysis,
   and (3) application and decision module formulates decisions and
   initiates events. The proposed architecture is a generic solution for
   the smart urban planning and variety of datasets is analyzed to validate
   this architecture. In addition, we tested reliable datasets on Hadoop
   server to verify the threshold limit value (TLV) and the investigation
   demonstrates that the proposed scheme offer valuable imminent into the
   community development systems to get better the existing smart urban
   architecture. Moreover, the efficiency of proposed architecture in terms
   of throughput is also shown. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years the concept of Smart cities has emerged to
   transform urban areas into connected and well informed spaces. Services
   that make smart cities ``smart{''} are curated by using data streams of
   smart cities i.e., inhabitants' location information, digital
   engagement, transportation, environment and local government data.
   Accumulating and processing of these data streams raise security and
   privacy concerns at individual and community levels. Sizeable attempts
   have been made to ensure the security and privacy of inhabitants' data.
   However, the security and privacy issues of smart cities are not only
   confined to inhabitants; service providers and local governments have
   their own reservations service provider trust, reliability of the sensed
   data, and data ownership, to name a few. In this research we identified
   a comprehensive list of stakeholders and modelled their involvement in
   smart cities by using the Onion Model approach. Based on the model we
   present a security and privacy-aware framework for service provisioning
   in smart cities, namely the `Smart Secure Service Provisioning'
   (SSServProv) Framework. Unlike previous attempts, our framework provides
   end-to-end security and privacy features for trustable data acquisition,
   transmission, processing and legitimate service provisioning. The
   proposed framework ensures inhabitants' privacy, and also guarantees
   integrity of services. It also ensures that public data is never misused
   by malicious service providers. To demonstrate the efficacy of
   SSServProv we developed and tested core functionalities of
   authentication, authorisation and lightweight secure communication
   protocol for data acquisition and service provisioning. For various
   smart cities service provisioning scenarios we verified these protocols
   by an automated security verification tool called Scyther. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Communications are revolutionizing transport systems. Recently, novel
   technologies from the fields of telecommunications and data networks
   have been incorporated into both vehicle systems and road
   infrastructures, setting new frontiers in the design and development of
   Smart Cities and Smart Urban Mobility. Whereas each scenario, i.e., the
   vehicular one and the data communications one, has its own and
   well-defined particularities, there are also similarities that should be
   further explored. In this work, we address this confluence of research
   areas by investigating the applicability in vehicle traffic management
   of an active queue control algorithm employed in communication networks
   and called Random Early Detection (RED). RED provides congestion
   avoidance in data networks by controlling the average queue size of
   network buffers. It detects incipient congestion and, using
   probabilistic packet-marking or packet-dropping behavior, it is able to
   keep the data network at high throughput and low delay. In this work, we
   propose an adaption of RED to vehicle traffic management in signaled
   intersections, namely, RED for Vehicles (REDV). A complete
   characterization of REDV is provided, including the impact of several
   configuration parameters. We also conduct an extensive comparative
   performance evaluation via computer simulation. Results show that REDV
   is a light and simple algorithm able to significantly reduce the average
   trip time, waiting time, and CO2 emissions in a signaled intersection
   compared to other approaches from the related literature.}},

   classifies smart city data in sensitive, quasi-sensitive, and

Title = {{The impact of the UK household life-cycle transitions on the electricity
   and gas usage patterns}},

Abstract = {{The residential sector accounts for approximately 27\% and 17\% of the
   world energy consumption and its CO2 emission, respectively. Thus, it is
   necessary to develop measures to reduce the dioxide emissions in this
   sector to ensure the sustainable development of the urban environment.
   However, the majority of existing sustainable measures revolve around
   improving the thermal quality of the building's envelope with lesser
   focus on the social and behavioural aspects of energy consumption. For
   those reasons, our paper aims to address a completely new social aspect
   of energy sustainability which is household life-cycle transitions. More
   precisely, we will investigate the impact of UK households transitions
   from one household type to another (e.g. single to couple) on their
   energy consumption. To attain this, an official British database, which
   encompasses around 6000 households observed annually for over 10 years,
   was analysed using some statistical tests and procedures, including
   logistic regression. This enabled us to first determine the
   socioeconomic factors influencing the households' evolutionary patterns.
   Subsequently, predict possible future transition patterns for a period
   of 10 years. Based on that, the impact of the predicted transitions on
   gas and electricity consumption was enquired. The analysis of main
   findings has suggested that households transition patterns have a
   significant impact on their gas and electricity consumption. However,
   this effect is weak and mostly positive in direction. Finally, we argue
   that incorporating the powerful concept of household life-cycle
   transition into urban energy planning will permit the forecasting of
   residential energy consumption in relation to different household
   transition patterns. This will in turn assist urban planners in their
   sustainable energy planning decision-making and enable them to develop
   appropriate measures.}},

   water provision to a question of water in- and out-flow measurements and
   the monitoring of BWSSB ground personnel. In theoretical terms, we
   discuss the ways in which these processes constitute both particular

Abstract = {{Nowadays, one of the main challenges in the smart cities is mining
   high-level semantics from lowlevel activities. In this context,
   real-time data streams are continuously produced and analysed by
   efficient and effective algorithms, which are able to handle
   complexities related to big data, in order to enable the core functions
   of Decision Support Systems in the smart city. These algorithms should
   receive input data coming from different city domains (or pillars) and
   process, aggregate and reason over them in a way that it is possible to
   find hidden correlations among different and heterogeneous elements
   (e.g., traffic, weather, cultural events) along space and time
   dimensions. This paper proposes the online implementation and deployment
   of Temporal Fuzzy Concept Analysis on a distributed realtime computation
   system, based on Apache Storm, to face with big data stream analysis in
   the smart city context. Such online distributed algorithm is able to
   incrementally generate the timed fuzzy lattice that organizes the
   knowledge on several and cross-domain aspects of the city. Temporal
   patterns, of how situations evolve in the city, can be elicited by both
   exploring the lattice and observing its growth in order to obtain
   actionable knowledge to support smart city decision-making processes.

Title = {{Urban planning and agriculture. Methodology for assessing rooftop
   greenhouse potential of non-residential areas using airborne sensors}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{601}},

Abstract = {{The integration of rooftop greenhouses (RTGs) in urban buildings is a
   practice that is becoming increasingly important in the world for their
   contribution to food security and sustainable development. However, the
   supply of tools and procedures to facilitate their implementation at the
   city scale is limited and laborious. This work aims to develop a
   specific and automated methodology for identifying the feasibility of
   implementation of rooftop greenhouses in non-residential urban areas,
   using airborne sensors. The use of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)
   and Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) data and the Leica ALS50-II and TASI-600
   sensors allow for the identification of some building roof parameters
   (area, slope, materials, and solar radiation) to determine the potential
   for constructing a RTG. This development represents an improvement in
   time and accuracy with respect to previous methodology, where all the
   relevant information must be acquired manually.
   The methodology has been applied and validated in a case study
   corresponding to a non-residential urban area in the industrial
   municipality of Rubi, Barcelona (Spain). Based on this practical
   application, an area of 36,312 m(2) out of a total area of 1,243,540
   m(2) of roofs with ideal characteristics for the construction of RTGs
   was identified. This area can produce approximately 600 tons of tomatoes
   per year, which represents the average yearly consumption for about 50\%
   of Rubi total population.
   The use of this methodology also facilitates the decision making process
   in urban agriculture, allowing a quick identification of optimal
   surfaces for the future implementation of urban agriculture in housing.
   It also opens new avenues for the use of airborne technology in
   environmental topics in cities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In the era of ``big data{''}, recent developments in the area of
   information and communication technologies (ICT) are facilitating
   organizations to innovate and grow. These technological developments and
   wide adaptation of ubiquitous computing enable numerous opportunities
   for government and companies to reconsider healthcare prospects.
   Therefore, big data and smart healthcare systems are independently
   attracting extensive attention from both academia and industry. The
   combination of both big data and smart systems can expedite the
   prospects of the healthcare industry. However, a thorough study of big
   data and smart systems together in the healthcare context is still
   absent from the existing literature. The key contributions of this
   article include an organized evaluation of various big data and smart
   system technologies and a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art
   advanced healthcare systems. We describe the three-dimensional structure
   of a paradigm shift. We also extract three broad technical branches (3T)
   contributing to the promotion of healthcare systems. More specifically,
   we propose a big data enabled smart healthcare system framework (BSHSF)
   that offers theoretical representations of an infra and inter
   organizational business model in the healthcare context. We also mention
   some examples reported in the literature, and then we contribute to
   pinpointing the potential opportunities and challenges of applying BSHSF
   to healthcare business environments. We also make five recommendations
   for effectively applying `BSHSF to the healthcare industry. To the best
   of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study about
   state-of-the-art big data and smart healthcare systems in parallel. The
   managerial implication of this article is that organizations can use the
   findings of our critical analysis to reinforce their strategic
   arrangement of smart systems and big data in the healthcare context, and
   hence better leverage them for sustainable organizational invention. (C)

Abstract = {{Traffic prediction in smart cities is an essential way for intelligent
   transportation system. The objective of this article is designing and
   implementing a traffic prediction scheme which can forecast the traffic
   flow with high efficiency and accuracy in Hong Kong. One problem in
   traffic prediction is how to balance the importance of historical
   traffic data and real-time traffic data. To make use of the real-time
   data as well as the history records, our ideas are combining data-driven
   approaches with model-driven approaches. First, the limitations of two
   baseline approaches auto-regressive integrated moving average and
   periodical moving average model are discussed. Second, artificial neural
   network is applied in the hybrid prediction model to balance between the
   two models. The training of neural network enables the artificial neural
   network to weight between real-time traffic data and traffic patterns
   revealed by historical traffic data. Furthermore, an emergency strategy
   using the Bayesian network is added to the prediction scheme to handle
   with the traffic accident or other emergent situation. The emergency
   prediction strategy on unexpected traffic situation considers the
   traffic condition of nearby links to predict the speed change on the
   link. Finally, experimental results of short-term and long-term
   predictions demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed

Title = {{Exploring spatial explicit greenhouse gas inventories: Location-based
   accounting approach and implications in Japan}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{702-712}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Cities are both the main source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the main
   arena of emission reductions. However, many cities have difficulties to
   compile the GHG inventories to support their mitigation plans and
   actions scientifically. Currently, the IPCC framework of inventories is
   mostly sector-based, within which the emission from a certain sector is
   estimated as an aggregated volume based on statistical yearbooks. Since
   the data is only available above some administration level, emissions
   are difficult to scale down to a specific geographical boundary. With
   this circumstance, a spatial explicit accounting approach on the
   city-level GHG inventory is required to provide sophisticated
   information for the better decision-making on the local mitigation
   actions. The aim of this study is to propose a location-based GHG
   inventory approach to fill the gap. The proposed inventory framework
   uses sampling surveys, enterprise GHG reports and the geo-referenced
   data to estimate the emissions and the spatial distributions. Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS) are used to integrate the results. The
   proposed framework is applied to Oita Prefecture, Japan as an
   implication to test the approach's feasibility and offering enlightening
   insights. Since the emission sources are visible on maps and one can
   zoom to any necessary level of scale, the location-based inventory can
   better provide the spatial explicit information for better mitigation
   policy-making and environmental education at community levels. It will
   also provide enlightening insights to the in-depth investigation on the
   relationships between distribution of GHG emissions and the city
   landscapes, hence benefitting the low-carbon city research and practice
   in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports main criteria for design, realization and validation
   of a solar-powered hydrogen fueling station in a smart city application
   relevant to an on-site hydrogen production plant. The program has been
   developed by CNR-ITAE together with other industrial partners in the
   framework of the Italian research project called i-NEXT (innovation for
   greeN Energy and eXchange in Transportation). The i-NEXT hydrogen
   production plant is located in the Municipality of Capo d'Orlando,
   Sicily, it is fed by a microgrid able to receive energy from solar
   radiation by a 100 kW rooftop photovoltaic plant and connected with a
   battery energy storage of 300 kWh (composed by 16 sodium nickel chloride
   high temperature batteries). The plant is able to deliver hydrogen and
   electricity for an electric and hydrogen vehicles fleet. The hydrogen
   fueling station includes four subsystems: a hydrogen production system
   by electrolysis, a compression system, a high-pressure storage system
   and a hydrogen dispenser for automotive applications. It is able to
   generate in the hydrogen production subsystem through an alkaline
   electrolyzer of 30 kWh: 6.64 Nm(3)/h of H-2 with a gas purity of
   99.995\% (O-2 < 5 ppm and dew point <-60 degrees C). The compression
   subsystem has a three stage compressor with a rated gas flow rate of 5,2
   Nm(3)/h and a delivery pressure of 360 bar. The compressed H-2 gas is
   stored in a high-pressure tanks of 350 L capacity allowing, in this way,
   a supply through a dispenser system of two auto motive's tanks of 150 L
   @ 350 bar in less than 30 min. This paper reports the design and the
   development results coming from a first test campaign. (C) 2017 Hydrogen

Abstract = {{Many actions have been recently carried out within European cities with
   the aim of reduce the negative impacts on traffic and environment caused
   by transport. New technologies for vehicles and traffic management are
   the key to lower transport emissions and the electric approach is a
   promising line to achieve EU's emissions reduction target for 2030 and
   2050. Electric Vehicles (EVs) include vehicles with different
   technologies such as Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Fuel Cell
   Vehicles (FCVs) or Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). BEVs operate purely
   on the battery power but the energy storage system remains one of the
   main critical elements due to vehicle autonomy, weight and charging
   time. FCV outperform BEV for its high autonomy and it is possible to
   perform a hydrogen recharge in short time but the costs remain high.
   Different from these last, hybrid configurations carried out through
   Batteries and Fuel Cell System (FCS) show advantages for both
   technologies. Within an Italian research project, CNR TAE Institute has
   been involved in a Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle (FCHEV) development
   for public transportation. The hybrid vehicle provides the use of a FCS
   that distributes the electrical power in the connection between
   batteries and traction inverter via a DC/DC converter for the extension
   of the daily autonomy with respect to pure electric mode. This work
   describes the possibilities for sustainable development of public
   passenger transport based on hydrogen technologies presenting the
   development phases of the powertrain and preliminary on road tests in
   the context of smart cities applications. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy

Journal = {{CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE \& EXPERIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology paradigm where
   millions of sensors and actuators help monitor and manage physical,
   environmental, and human systems in real time. The inherent closed-loop
   responsiveness and decision making of IoT applications make them ideal
   candidates for using low latency and scalable stream processing
   platforms. Distributed stream processing systems (DSPS) hosted in cloud
   data centers are becoming the vital engine for real-time data processing
   and analytics in any IoT software architecture. But the efficacy and
   performance of contemporary DSPS have not been rigorously studied for
   IoT applications and data streams. Here, we propose RIoTBench, a
   real-time IoT benchmark suite, along with performance metrics, to
   evaluate DSPS for streaming IoT applications. The benchmark includes 27
   common IoT tasks classified across various functional categories and
   implemented as modular microbenchmarks. Further, we define four IoT
   application benchmarks composed from these tasks based on common
   patterns of data preprocessing, statistical summarization, and
   predictive analytics that are intrinsic to the closed-loop IoT
   decision-making life cycle. These are coupled with four stream workloads
   sourced from real IoT observations on smart cities and smart health,
   with peak streams rates that range from 500 to 10000messages/second from
   up to 3million sensors. We validate the RIoTBench suite for the popular
   Apache Storm DSPS on the Microsoft Azure public cloud and present
   empirical observations. This suite can be used by DSPS researchers for
   performance analysis and resource scheduling, by IoT practitioners to
   evaluate DSPS platforms, and even reused within IoT solutions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{20-30}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Designing a large infrastructure, such as a street lighting system, is a
   complex task itself especially in the context of Smart City and Smart
   Grid approaches. The problem is made even harder if it needs to be
   designed with control in mind. To facilitate a complex design process
   without losing fidelity, a graph based formalism, namely General
   Environment Model (GEM), is proposed to be applied to model such an
   environment. Moreover, another graph-based model, namely Control
   Availability Graph or shortly CAG, is proposed to enable definition of
   routines for dynamic control of large-scale systems. Both of these
   models have been verified in practice, but the transition from GEM to
   CAG had been performed manually. In this paper, we propose a coherent,
   formal method of generating a control system from the graph-based
   environment description while taking into account the designer's
   decisions. An application of the generated CAG as a control system
   yields up to 34\% of energy consumption reduction in a pilot deployment
   of over 3500 light points for the city of Krakow, Poland. (C) 2017

   AVC are also compared in light of the real-world challenges they
   represent, and those they do not. The major challenges involved in each
   category of AVC systems are presented, highlighting open problems in
   this area of research. Finally, we conclude by providing future
   directions of research in this area, paving the way toward efficient
   large-scale AVC systems. This survey shall help researchers interested

Abstract = {{Geoinformation and Communication Technology (GeoICT) is being
   increasingly adopted to foster urban sustainability and smart cities.
   Despite the burgeoning utilization of GeoICT, the development of
   frameworks of components and guidelines is still at the infancy. This is
   due to the fact that GeoICT implementations are guided by contextual
   factors and there is no one size fits all approach. This paper focuses
   on the topic of leveraging GeoICT for smart sustainable cities by
   examining the Saudi Arabian experience using information from the
   literature, government websites, official documents, newspaper articles
   and personal interviews. This study reviews the definitions, typologies,
   and frameworks of implementing GeoICT and smart cities. It highlights
   case studies of sniart city development in Saudi Arabia. A comparison of
   the Saudi case studies with frameworks and practices found in the
   literature is presented. This paper concludes with policy implications
   for Saudi Arabia and lessons for GeoICT and smart city development. It
   is concluded that local context has an influence on the implementation
   of smart cities, ICT infrastructure is necessary but not sufficient for
   developing smart cities and blending top-down with bottom-up approaches
   is essential.}},

Title = {{A Middleware Solution for Wireless IoT Applications in Sparse Smart
   Cities}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The spread of off-the-shelf mobile devices equipped with multiple
   wireless interfaces together with sophisticated sensors is paving the
   way to novel wireless Internet of Things (IoT) environments,
   characterized by multi-hop infrastructure-less wireless networks where
   devices carried by users act as sensors/actuators as well as network
   nodes. In particular, the paper presents Real Ad-hoc Multi-hop Peer-to
   peer-Wireless IoT Application (RAMP-WIA), a novel solution that
   facilitates the development, deployment, and management of applications
   in sparse Smart City environments, characterized by users willing to
   collaborate by allowing new applications to be deployed on their
   smartphones to remotely monitor and control fixed/mobile devices.
   RAMP-WIA allows users to dynamically configure single-hop wireless
   links, to manage opportunistically multi-hop packet dispatching
   considering that the network topology (together with the availability of
   sensors and actuators) may abruptly change, to actuate reliably sensor
   nodes specifically considering that only part of them could be actually
   reachable in a timely manner, and to upgrade dynamically the nodes
   through over-the-air distribution of new software components. The paper
   also reports the performance of RAMP-WIA on simple but realistic cases
   of small-scale deployment scenarios with off-the-shelf Android
   smartphones and Raspberry Pi devices; these results show not only the
   feasibility and soundness of the proposed approach, but also the
   efficiency of the middleware implemented when deployed on real testbeds.}},

Abstract = {{In sustainable smart cities, power saving is a severe challenge in the
   energy-constrained Internet of Things (IoT). Efficient utilization of
   limited multiple non-overlap channels and time resources is a promising
   solution to reduce the network interference and save energy consumption.
   In this paper, we propose a joint channel allocation and time slot
   optimization solution for IoT. First, we propose a channel ranking
   algorithm which enables each node to rank its available channels based
   on the channel properties. Then, we propose a distributed channel
   allocation algorithm so that each node can choose a proper channel based
   on the channel ranking and its own residual energy. Finally, the
   sleeping duration and spectrum sensing duration are jointly optimized to
   maximize the normalized throughput and satisfy energy consumption
   constraints simultaneously. Different from the former approaches, our
   proposed solution requires no central coordination or any global
   information that each node can operate based on its own local
   information in a total distributed manner. Also, theoretical analysis
   and extensive simulations have validated that when applying our solution
   in the network of IoT: (i) each node can be allocated to a proper
   channel based on the residual energy to balance the lifetime; (ii) the
   network can rapidly converge to a collision-free transmission through
   each node's learning ability in the process of the distributed channel
   allocation; and (iii) the network throughput is further improved via the
   dynamic time slot optimization.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Smart cities are demanding solutions for improved traffic efficiency, in
   order to guarantee optimal access to mobility resources available in
   urban areas. Intelligent video analytics deployed directly on board
   embedded sensors offers great opportunities to gather highly informative
   data about traffic and transport, allowing reconstruction of a real-time
   neat picture of urban mobility patterns. In this paper, we present a
   visual sensor network in which each node embeds computer vision logics
   for analyzing in real time urban traffic. The nodes in the network share
   their perceptions and build a global and comprehensive interpretation of
   the analyzed scenes in a cooperative and adaptive fashion. This is
   possible thanks to an especially designed Internet of Things (IoT)
   compliant middleware which encompasses in-network event composition as
   well as full support of Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication mechanism.
   The potential of the proposed cooperative visual sensor network is shown
   with two sample applications in urban mobility connected to the
   estimation of vehicular flows and parking management. Besides providing
   detailed results of each key component of the proposed solution, the
   validity of the approach is demonstrated by extensive field tests that
   proved the suitability of the system in providing a scalable, adaptable
   and extensible data collection layer for managing and understanding
   mobility in smart cities.}},

Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recent growth in the use of photovoltaic technology and a rapid
   reduction in its cost confirms the potential of solar power on a large
   scale. In this context, planning for the deployment of smart grids is
   among the most important challenges to support the increased penetration
   of solar energy in urban areas and to ensure the resilience of the
   electricity system. As part this effort, the present paper describes a
   cellular approach to a Net-Zero energy concept, based on the balance
   between the potential solar energy supply and the existing consumption
   patterns at the urban unit scale. To do that, the Geographical Urban
   Units Delimitation model (GUUD) has been developed and tested on a case
   study. By applying the GUUD model, which combines Geographic Information
   Systems (GIS), parametric modelling, and solar dynamic analysis, the
   whole area of the city was divided into urban cells, categorized as
   solar producers and energy consumers. The discussion around three
   theoretical scenarios permits us to explore how smart grids can be
   approached and promoted from an urban planning perspective. The paper
   provides insights into how urban planning can be a driver to optimize
   and manage energy balance across the city if the deployment of smart
   grids is correctly integrated in its operative process.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a global communication network
   between millions of devices connected to the internet. Similarly, the
   emergence of heterogeneous wireless networks provides a medium to the
   IoT communication paradigm. In order to enable an energy-friendly
   communication in an IoT environment, such as smart home, office, city,
   etc. we propose an energy-aware communication systems for IoT
   environments. The proposed scheme works in several phases such as
   identification of high energy require appliances, deployment of sensors,
   scheduling, etc. Moreover, the data from the IoT devices are collected
   through sensors. The data is tested using the Hadoop ecosystem for
   future planning and efficient usage of the energy in an IoT environment.
   The proposed architecture is tested in a different scenario against the
   Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based IoT architecture in the context of
   energy consumption. The proposed architecture performs efficiently than
   WSN in a number of scenarios. Similarly, the efficiency and processing

Abstract = {{Population growth at an interminable rate is depleting resources
   uncontrollably. Researchers are concentrating on sustainable development
   mainly in urban areas where the growth rate is higher than any other
   regions. In addition to the development of new technologies for reducing
   the rate of natural resources usage, technologies are being developed to
   recover the resources from waste. In this perspective, solid waste
   management with proper collection and transportation techniques
   facilitates the waste managers to segregate and extract the required
   resources for recovery. GIS and remote sensing approaches come to the
   aid of managing this solid waste through its generation stage to the
   dumping stage. Using a proposed smart city, Vellore in India as a case
   study, this paper discusses possible collection methods for solid waste
   management in India, and presents methods for optimal collection and
   transportation of waste using GIS techniques through network analysis.
   The optimal waste collection and transportation routes derived from our
   analysis result in 59.12\% reduction in travel distance along the
   routine collection road network followed. In addition, this study
   proposes possible transfer station locations based on various design
   factors like open land availability, ease of access from all the
   composting units/dustbin locations, transfer means by tractor trailers,
   and sanitation and environmental requirements. This study also reveals
   the vegetation cover changes at a depletion rate of 2100 square meters
   area in and around dumping sites.}},

Title = {{Optimal placement of water-level sensors to facilitate data-driven
   management of hydrological infrastructure assets in coastal mega-cities

Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY}},

Abstract = {{Management decisions, including real-time control of hydrological
   infrastructure assets such as drainage channels or waterways,
   floodgates, pumping stations, etc. are crucial for the sustainability of
   flood-prone coastal mega-cities. The veracity of such crucial flood
   control decisions depends heavily on the availability of city-wide,
   real-time water-level data which is often lacking in developing
   countries. Smart sensors can reliably provide the required data, but
   installing one of these devices in every single point in the
   hydrological network is not economically feasible. This study proposes a
   methodology for finding optimal locations for the placement of a limited
   number of water-level sensors, such that the acquired data are most
   relevant for facilitating informed decisions about management of the
   flood control infrastructure in different parts of a coastal city. The
   proposed methodology entails defining a set of optimisation objectives
   and constraint, which are then assessed computationally at each
   potential sensor location through the topological/connectivity analysis
   of a city-wide, graph-based hydrological infrastructure network. The

Abstract = {{Internet of things (IoT) for Smart cities has been gradually bringing a
   sea of technological changes in our day to day life, which in turn helps
   to make our life more comfortable. Sensing and timely disseminating the
   information to the base station is the main feature in Internet of
   Things enabled applications. This function is carried out by the base
   layer of IoT paradigm and it is consisted of wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs). In this paper, we propose a WSN-IoT paradigm for real-time
   applications. The main focus is to find the means of providing
   information as early as possible to receiver which is prerequisite in
   smart cities. In this paper, routing is based on the shortest path which
   is selected using TOPSIS optimization and achieves balance between
   performance and energy consumption with regard to four criteria's: 1)
   Least distance of selected nodes from the base station, 2) Residual
   Energy, 3) minimum Euclidean distance between mth selected node and 4)
   next optimum nth node in the transmission range and number of
   neighboring nodes. Finally, Simulations are conducted in MATLAB in order
   to demonstrate how the proposed method would work to locate the best
   node in each cycle and confirm its effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Urban development can occur through diffusion (sprawl) or coalescence.
   This paper selects all 363 prefecture-level or higher level cities in
   China and detects their dynamic change of urban growth pattern in
   1995-2005 and 2005-2015. Three main findings can be obtained: (1) In two
   periods, the vast majority of Chinese cities are expanding by the way of
   edge-expansion.(2) Cities in the western region tend to be most likely
   to grow through dispersion (64.71\%), with smaller percentages of cities
   in the eastern region (46.08\%) and the central region (43.20\%) growing
   through dispersion; (3) During the two stages of urban development, the
   achievement of controlling urban sprawl is mainly in the city with high
   economic development level. (4) Xinyu City, Nujiang City, Guangyuan City
   etc., a total of 20 individual cities are the key cities where urban
   sprawl is occurring, besides, the junction of Gansu Province, Inner
   Mongolia Autonomous Region and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in the
   northwest China and the junction of northern part of Jiangsu Province
   and Anhui Province in the east China are the key regions of urban
   diffusional sprawl, The result of this paper could provide reference to
   China's urban master planning in the future.}},

Abstract = {{As the concept of smart cities is evolving, the need for automation and
   effective delivery of services is essential. Over the last few decades,
   need for safety and security of travelers on the road has been a major
   concern. Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) can play an influential role
   in recognizing and implementing such concept, by supporting safety,
   comfort and infotainment services. However, the complex and inflexible
   architecture of VANETs faced a set of challenges such as high mobility,
   intermittent connectivity, heterogeneity of applications. In this
   context, Software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a programmable
   and flexible network, which has recently gained attention from research
   communities, businesses, and industries, in both wired network
   management and heterogeneous wireless communication. This paper aims at
   examining and classifying a number of related SDN-based research works
   on wireless networks specially VANETs. Firstly, a brief on the
   requirements of SDN over traditional networking is provided, followed by
   an elaboration on basic architecture and its layers. Thereafter, SDN
   applications in various wireless network areas such as mobile network
   and VANETs are described along with a focus on analyzing and comparing
   the current SDN-related research on different parameters. Furthermore,
   the paper presents a review of current research initiatives to solve
   challenges of vehicular environment. The impact of SDN paradigm along
   with implementation issues in vehicular communication and explore likely
   use cases based on SDN paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{Since motorcycles are one of the main sources of noise in urban
   environments, the use of electric powered two-wheelers may contribute to
   the improvement of soundscapes in Smart Cities. However, quiet vehicles
   can lead to an increased risk of accident for pedestrians and other
   drivers. In order to assess the noise generated by powered two-wheelers
   and their detectability, five different low capacity motorcycles were
   measured in a pass-by noise test. The measurements were performed at
   different speeds using a linear microphone array and a dummy head. The
   sound directivity radiated by the moving sources was studied with a
   microphone array. To establish the detectability of powered
   two-wheelers, thirty-seven subjects participated in an auditory test
   consisting on a virtual road-crossing scenario. The subjects had to
   detect the approaching of a vehicle at 20 km/h. The results showed a
   significant reduction in the sound pressure level emitted by electric
   motorcycles at low-speed, as well as a notable increase in sound
   directivity with velocity. The reaction time obtained for the detection
   of electric powered two-wheelers was higher compared to the traditional
   propulsion ones. The results highlighted the risk posed by this kind of
   electric vehicles for pedestrians.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary urbanization appears as a conundrum especially in
   developing nations. This study will act as an accelerator to spill out
   snags caused by urbanization with a new approach in the development of
   sustainable infrastructure through Public-Private Partnerships (3Ps).
   This study first explains the complications generated by rapid
   urbanization in different infrastructural sectors in South Asian mega
   cities like Dhaka and Lahore. Second, the findings of the study
   elaborate on a new mechanism to adapt to Sustainable Development Goal 11
   declared by the United Nations with the engagement of different stake
   holders working in different silos through 3Ps (like BOT, BOOT, BLT,
   DBF, PFI etc.). This study uses case studies as part of the research
   mixed methodology. Studies on Dhaka and Lahore including multi projects
   through 3Ps, and a detailed questionnaire survey based on critical risk
   factors from the Meta review of 3P literature are presented to establish
   the current status of sustainable development goals. This paper
   primarily contributes in two ways. First, by providing a new direction
   to policy makers to devise policies using a twofold approach i.e., grasp
   urbanization with sustainable infrastructure delivery by sustainable
   enactment of 3P projects. Second, bridge the knowledge gap by
   identifying the risk factors in the sustainable establishment of 3P
   projects in developing nations.}},

Abstract = {{With rapid population growth, urban designers face tremendous challenges
   to accommodate the increasing size of the population in urban areas
   while simultaneously considering future environmental, social, and
   economic impacts. A smart city is an urban development vision that
   integrates multiple information and communication technologies to manage
   the assets of a city, including its information systems, transportation
   systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste management systems,
   and other community services provided by a local department. The goal of
   creating a smart city is to improve the quality of life of citizens by
   using technology and by addressing the environmental, social, cultural,
   and physical needs of a society. Data modeling and data visualization
   are integral parts of planning a smart city, and planning professionals
   currently seek new methods for real-time simulations. The impact
   analysis of what-if scenarios frequently takes a significant amount of
   time and resources, and virtual reality (VR) is a potential tool for
   addressing these challenges. VR is a computer technology that replicates
   an environment, whether real or imagined, and simulates the physical
   presence and environment of a user to allow for user interaction. This
   paper presents a review of the capacity of VR to address current
   challenges in creating, modeling, and visualizing smart cities through
   material modeling and light simulation in a VR environment. This study
   can assist urban planners, stakeholders, and communities to further
   understand the roles of planning policies in creating a smart city,
   particularly in the early design stages. The significant roles of
   technologies, such as VR, in targeting real-time simulations and
   visualization requirements for smart cities are emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research is to identify the status and role of
   mobile technology in achieving sustainable and smart tourism, and to
   suggest future research and strategy directions for academia and
   managers in practice. This research utilized multiple sources, such as
   patents, academic articles, and news, and selected methodologies
   optimized for the purpose of each study. Study 1 used Netminer, a social
   network analysis program, to analyze the relationships between patent's
   International Patent Classification (IPC) codes. Study 2 used the T-LAB
   program for content analysis to analyze the texts of patents, journal
   articles, and news. Study 3 used the Leximancer program, which utilizes
   relative frequency to analyze mobile app consumer reviews. In study 1,
   we identified various forms of data related technologies and mobile
   technologies for smart city systems and maps. In study 2, we found the
   environment, sustainability, business, and market themes to be related
   to mobile technology. In study 3, we explored consumers' attitudes and
   preferences for mobile travel app using their reviews. Advances in
   mobile technology are expected to create innovative experiences for
   consumers, foster a sustainable competitive advantage for tourism

Abstract = {{Nowadays, governments and companies are looking for solutions to
   increase the collection level of various waste types by using new
   technologies and devices such as smart sensors, Internet of Things
   (IoT), cloud platforms etc. In order to fulfil this need, this paper
   presents solutions provided by a research project involving the design,
   development and implementation of fully automated waste collection
   systems with an increased usage degree, productivity and storage
   capacity. The paper will focus on the main results of this research
   project in turning the automated waste collection system into a smart
   system so that it can be easily integrated in any smart city
   infrastructure. For this purpose, the Internet of Things platform for
   the automated waste collection system provided by the project will allow
   real time monitoring and communication with central systems. Details
   about each module are sent to the central systems: various modules'
   statuses (working, blocked, needs repairs or maintenance etc.);
   equipment status; storage systems status (allowing full reports for all
   waste types); the amount of waste for each module, allowing optimal
   discharging; route optimization for waste discharging etc. To do that,
   we describe here an IoT cloud solution integrating device connection,
   data processing, analytics and management.}},

Title = {{A Flexible Algorithm for Detecting Challenging Moving Objects in
   Real-Time within IR Video Sequences}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Real-time detecting moving objects in infrared video sequences may be
   particularly challenging because of the characteristics of the objects,
   such as their size, contrast, velocity and trajectory. Many proposed
   algorithms achieve good performances but only in the presence of some
   specific kinds of objects, or by neglecting the computational time,
   becoming unsuitable for real-time applications. To obtain more
   flexibility in different situations, we developed an algorithm capable
   of successfully dealing with small and large objects, slow and fast
   objects, even if subjected to unusual movements, and poorly-contrasted
   objects. The algorithm is also capable to handle the contemporary
   presence of multiple objects within the scene and to work in real-time
   even using cheap hardware. The implemented strategy is based on a fast
   but accurate background estimation and rejection, performed pixel by
   pixel and updated frame by frame, which is robust to possible background
   intensity changes and to noise. A control routine prevents the
   estimation from being biased by the transit of moving objects, while two
   noise-adaptive thresholding stages, respectively, drive the estimation
   control and allow extracting moving objects after the background
   removal, leading to the desired detection map. For each step, attention
   has been paid to develop computationally light solution to achieve the
   real-time requirement. The algorithm has been tested on a database of
   infrared video sequences, obtaining promising results against different
   kinds of challenging moving objects and outperforming other commonly
   adopted solutions. Its effectiveness in terms of detection performance,
   flexibility and computational time make the algorithm particularly
   suitable for real-time applications such as intrusion monitoring,
   activity control and detection of approaching objects, which are
   fundamental task in the emerging research area of Smart City.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a large-scale experimentation of the smart sewage

   originality of this paper lies in the integrated approach, which
   includes smart monitoring as well as data collection and analysis. The
   monitoring of the drinking water and sewage networks allows the use of
   numerical modelling of and the detection of eventual connection between
   the sewage and storm water systems. The paper shows how the smart
   technology could be implemented and used to enhance our understanding of

Title = {{The water-energy-food nexus: An integration agenda and implications for
   urban governance}},
Journal = {{POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{215-223}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The water-energy-food nexus has achieved considerable prominence across
   academic research and policy sectors. The nexus sets an imperative for
   integrated management and policymaking, centring on the potential
   trade-offs and complementarities between interdependent water, energy
   and food systems. Applications of the nexus focus largely on technical
   or managerial solutions and calls to acknowledge the political dimension
   of nexus interdependencies have implications for governance at the urban
   scale. This paper aims to `urbanise' the nexus agenda and consider the
   implications of policy integration for urban governance. This examines
   the nexus in the context of current approaches to urban governance and
   power relations shaping the provision of water, energy and food in urban
   areas. Urban infrastructure networks underpin these resource systems and
   related management systems, although their management tends to operate
   in silos, with little joint decision-making and planning. Three
   hypotheses about the interplay between integrative policy framings and
   urban governance are explored to reconcile integrative policy framings
   at the urban scale: the appropriation of the nexus narrative by urban
   governments; re-establishment of political power through integrated
   management, and implementation of the nexus through smart city
   approaches. These hypotheses progress the political dimension of the
   nexus debate and reflect on the role of urban governance in addressing
   global challenges. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The huge amount of data generated by devices, vehicles, buildings, the
   power grid, and many other connected things, coupled with increased
   rates of data transmission, constitute the big data challenge. Among
   many areas associated with the Internet of Things, smart grid and
   electric vehilces have their share of this challenge by being both
   producers and consumers (ie., prosumers) of big data. Electric vehicls
   can significantly help smart cities to become greener by reducing
   emissions of the transportation sector and play an important role in
   green smart cities. In this article, we first survey the data analytics
   techniques used for handling the big data of smart grid and electric
   vehicles. The data generated by electric vehicles come from sources that
   vary from sensors to trip logs. Once this vast amount of data are
   analyzed using big data techniques, they can be used to develop policies
   for siting charging stations, developing smart charging algorithms,
   solving energy efficiency issues, evaluating the capacity of power
   distribution systems to handle extra charging loads, and finally,
   determining the market value for the services provided by electric
   vehicles (i.e., vehicle-to-grid opportunities). This article provides a
   comprehensive overview of the data analytics landscape on the electric
   vehicle integration to green smart cities. It serves as a roadmap to the
   future data analytics needs and solutions for electric vehicle
   integration to smart cities.}},

Abstract = {{Networks of acoustic sensors are being deployed in smart cities to
   continuously monitor noise levels. In this paper, a novel acoustic
   sensor device is designed for binaural loudness evaluation, in a
   standalone platform. The audio is acquired from an array of microphones
   and a binaural signal is synthesized by a direction-of-arrival algorithm
   and a head-related transfer function. Hardware setup and software
   algorithms are presented and the results are discussed. Finally, the
   tests conducted in an early deployment show the feasibility of using the
   device to carry out large temporal and spatial sampling for the
   evaluation of binaural loudness.}},

Abstract = {{Smart control access to any service is at the very basis of any smart
   city project. Biometrics have been used as a solution for system access
   control, for many years now. However, the simple use of biometrics can
   not be considered as final and perfect solution. Most problems are
   related to the data transmission way between the medias, where the users
   require access and the servers where the biometric data, captured upon
   registration, are stored. In this paper, the use smart-cards is adopted
   as a possible effective yet efficient solution to this problem.
   Palm-prints have been used as a human identifier for a long time now.
   This biometric is considered one of the most reliable to distinguish a
   person from another as its unique yet stable over time. In this work, we
   propose an efficient implementation of palm-print verification on
   smart-cards. For this implementation, the matching is done on-card.
   Thus, the biometric characteristics are always kept in the owner's card,
   guaranteeing the maximum security and privacy. In a first approach, the
   False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) are improved
   using upward, downward, leftward and rightward translations of the
   matched palm-codes. However, after thorough analysis of the achieved
   results, we show that the proposed method introduces a significant
   increase in terms of execution time of the matching operation. In order
   to mitigate this impact, we augmented the proposed technique with an
   acceptance threshold verification, thus decreasing drastically the
   execution time of the matching operation, and yet achieving considerably
   low FAR and FRR. It is noteworthy to point out that these
   characteristics are at the basis of any access control successful usage.}},

Abstract = {{In February 2010, Google challenged US cities to compete for being the
   site of its first attempt at building ultra-high-speed
   fiber-to-the-premises (FITP) network, promising speeds up to one hundred
   times faster than pre-existing broadband services. More than 1100 cities
   applied. Kansas City, however, was announced as the winner of the
   competition. This paper explores the rollout of Google Fiber in Kansas
   City from three different perspectives. First, we provide a close
   examination of urban governance and the Fiber project - highlighting
   numerous regulatory concessions and incentives provided to Fiber during
   the construction phase. Second, we explore the ways in which
   pre-existing digital divides and socio-economic inequalities impacted
   the Fiber plan for Kansas City. Finally, in an effort to better
   understand the geographic intricacies of Fiber service, this paper uses
   a novel data mining technique and exploratory spatial data analysis to
   highlight the provision footprints for two counties in the Kansas City
   metropolitan area. We conclude with a discussion of the salient policy
   implications of projects like Fiber for urban governance, highlighting
   both the promises and stark realities of such ventures. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Smart city applications and services are increasingly considered as
   strategic means to cope with emerging global challenges such as climate
   change, pollution, the ageing population, and energy shortage. In
   particular, smart parking is a type of smart services used to improve
   traffic congestion and pollution within cities. Nevertheless, although
   smart city services are driven by advanced information technologies,
   their success is highly dependent on user engagement, which is
   historically problematic. This paper presents and discusses the results
   of a case study on the smart parking service in London. A questionnaire
   (involved a total of 212 local drivers) was adopted as the main data
   collection method. This was complemented by the collection and analysis
   of 470 online user comments left for the service. The results showed
   that London's smart parking service may potentially help each driver to
   save an average of A 68 pound (62.2 l) on petrol annually and reduce CO2
   emissions by 238.14 kg per car per year. At city level, a smart parking
   system could help London save A 183.6 pound million worth of petrol per
   year and reduce its annual CO2 emissions by 642,978 tons. However,
   public awareness, actual usage, and user satisfaction of this smart
   service are currently very low. These present substantial barriers to
   realise the potential economic and environmental benefits of the
   service. This paper concluded that further to the very technological
   efforts, local authorities and service providers need to make a stronger
   endeavour to enhance public engagement and user satisfaction towards
   smart services, in order to realise the promises of such solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Fixed-rail metro (or `subway') infrastructure is generally unable to
   provide access to all parts of the city grid. Consequently, feeder bus
   lines are an integral component of urban mass transit systems. While
   passengers prefer a seamless transfer between these two distinct
   transportation services, each service's operations are subject to a
   different set of factors that contribute to metro-bus transfer delay.
   Previous attempts to understand transfer delay were limited by the
   availability of tools to measure the time and cost associated with
   passengers' transfer experience. This paper uses data from smart card
   systems, an emerging technology that automatically collects passenger
   trip data, to understand transfer delay. The primary objective of this
   study is to use smart card data to derive a reproducible methodology
   that isolates high priority transfer points between the metro system and
   its feeder-bus systems. The paper outlines a methodology to identify
   transfer transactions in the smart card dataset, estimate bus headways
   without the aid of geographic location information, estimate three
   components of the total transfer time (walking time, waiting time, and
   delay time), and isolate high-priority transfer pairs. The paper uses
   smart card data from Nanjing, China as a case study. The results isolate
   eight high priority metro-bus transfer pairs in the Nanjing metro system
   and finally, offers several targeted measures to improve transfer
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Embedded between the broader fields of social and digital
   entrepreneurship, the concept of `smart cities' can be conceptualized as
   a domain that is currently pre-paradigmatic-that is, one in which
   multiple yet unaligned models exist, marked by the absence of a single
   dominant one. Despite such shortcomings, there is a reflective
   similarity across ecosystems as the various players attempt to converge
   on a common understanding of the term smart city. The common objective
   of smart city implementation is to spark economic growth and social
   development, facilitated by collaborative dialogue and innovations in
   technology. We integrate theoretical lenses to explore the roles played
   by ecosystem actors, stakeholders, and socioeconomic and political
   agents in creating economic value and solving societal problems-
   particularly highlighting opportunities and challenges to bottom-up
   innovation from local entrepreneurs. (C) 2017 Kelley School of Business,

Abstract = {{In the supply chain of fresh fruit and vegetables, large losses may
   incurred throughout the whole farm to fork route. Food supply chain
   management is faced with challenges of minimizing the post-harvest loss,
   while delivering the items directly to the refrigerators in smart homes
   (i.e. domotics). A substantial value can therefore be added to the
   criterion function by an immediate, real-time detection of changes in
   perishability dynamics, including a real-time calculation and
   communication of the remaining shelf life during transportation from one
   chain node to another. The changes in the estimated remaining shelf life
   can, therefore, be matched with the expected remaining transportation
   time, and so the critical moment can be avoided with a given
   probability. This can be done by dynamic rerouting in real time, based
   on previous net present value (NPV) criteria. Such criteria could then
   we include in the contractually stipulated remaining shelf life
   requirements at the delivery point. This paper focuses on a novel
   concept of moving activity cells which represent the moving cargo
   between the fixed activity cells in the extended material requirements
   planning (EMRP) model. The changes in NPV are calculated dynamically
   from the expected shelf life changes. Such real-time calculations and
   early reports are enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT)
   infrastructure, where there is a smart device that tracks ambient
   conditions like temperature, humidity, and gas concentrations. These
   early estimations allow a better decision making based on
   first-expired-first-out (FEFO) cold chain management strategies for
   perishable products. Therefore, the model includes the possibility to
   deliver the items to the local market if the expected contractually
   stipulated shelf-life losses become too high. The paper does not intend
   to discuss the details of IoT or analyse different sensors, but it
   wishes to show how the EMRP theory can be used to estimate the changes
   in NPV when moving activity cells are included in the model. The smart
   measurement devices embedded in moving activity cells of cyber-physical
   system measure the ambient data and broadcast decay acceleration factors
   and postharvest loss of cargo to the decision support system. The
   numerical example shows how smart measurement devices embedded in moving
   activity cells of cyber-physical system help to reduce the post-harvest
   loss in a supply chain by rerouting when necessary. The paper
   additionally shows how much such a cyber-physical system improves NPV by
   the development of decision-making processes in the real-time, using the
   IoT as infrastructure, including automatic rerouting in postharvest
   logistics.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge about what transport mode people use is important information
   of any mobility or travel behaviour research. With ubiquitous presence
   of smartphones, and its sensing possibilities, new opportunities to
   infer transport mode from movement data are appearing. In this paper we
   investigate the role of spatial context of human movements in inferring
   transport mode from mobile sensed data. For this we use data collected
   from more than 8000 participants over a period of four months, in
   combination with freely available geographical information. We develop a
   support vectors machines-based model to infer five transport modes and
   achieve success rate of 94\%. The developed model is applicable across
   different mobile sensed data, as it is independent on the integration of
   additional sensors in the device itself. Furthermore, suggested approach
   is robust, as it strongly relies on pre-processed data, which makes it
   applicable for big data implementations in (smart) cities and other
   data-driven mobility platforms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A map-matching algorithm outputs a vector per GPS point, projecting the
   moving object on one of the segments of the transportation network.
   Although developing more sophisticated map-matching algorithms for
   vehicle and pedestrian navigation systems have been the focus of
   research in this field, reusability of the historical information
   already provided by map-matching algorithms has not been addressed yet.
   In other words, although researchers have been attempting to improve the
   accuracy of the aforementioned vector to correctly project GPS points on
   the transportation network, no research has exploited the
   spatial-temporal pattern in the arrangement of these projection vectors.
   This pattern, if properly detected, can be used as a rough surrogate for
   map-matching algorithms, in addition to other applications that require
   better positional accuracy for moving objects in smart cities. This
   paper detects and validates the spatial-temporal pattern in projection
   vectors produced by map-matching algorithms via machine learning.
   Projection vectors showed a strong spatial-temporal pattern in Chicago,
   IL, USA, which was captured best via a local nonlinear regressor,
   K-nearest neighbors, and helped double the positional accuracy of unseen
   GPS points. While a global nonlinear regressor, multilayer Perceptron
   was able to slightly improve the positional accuracy of GPS points, the
   linear least squares had an exacerbating effect on the positional
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Metro systems have become one of the most important public transit
   services in cities. It is important to understand individual metro
   passengers' spatio-temporal travel patterns. More specifically, for a
   specific passenger: what are the temporal patterns? what are the spatial
   patterns? is there any relationship between the temporal and spatial
   patterns? are the passenger's travel patterns normal or special?
   Answering all these questions can help to improve metro services, such
   as evacuation policy making and marketing. Given a set of massive smart
   card data over a long period, how to effectively and systematically
   identify and understand the travel patterns of individual passengers in
   terms of space and time is a very challenging task. This paper proposes
   an effective data-mining procedure to better understand the travel
   patterns of individual metro passengers in Shenzhen, a modern and big
   city in China. First, we investigate the travel patterns in individual
   level and devise the method to retrieve them based on raw smart card
   transaction data, then use statistical-based and unsupervised
   clustering-based methods, to understand the hidden regularities and
   anomalies of the travel patterns. From a statistical-based point of
   view, we look into the passenger travel distribution patterns and find
   out the abnormal passengers based on the empirical knowledge. From
   unsupervised clustering point of view, we classify passengers in terms
   of the similarity of their travel patterns. To interpret the group
   behaviors, we also employ the bus transaction data. Moreover, the
   abnormal passengers are detected based on the clustering results. At
   last, we provide case studies and findings to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Social media and mobile devices have revolutionized the way people
   communicate and share information in various contexts, such as in
   cities. In today's ``smart{''} cities, massive amounts of multiple forms
   of geolocated content is generated daily in social media, out of which
   knowledge for social interactions and urban dynamics can be derived.
   This work addresses the problem of detecting urban social activity
   patterns and interactions, by modeling cities into ``dynamic areas{''},
   i.e., coherent geographic areas shaped through social activities. Social
   media users provide the information on such social activities and
   interactions in cases when they are on the move around the city
   neighborhoods. The proposed approach models city places as feature
   vectors which represent users visiting patterns (social activity), the
   time of observed visits (temporal activity), and the context of
   functionality of visited places category. To uncover the dynamics of
   city areas, a clustering approach is proposed which considers the
   derived feature vectors to group people's activities with respect to
   location, time, and context. The proposed methodology has been
   implemented on the DYNAMICITY platform which demonstrates neighborhood
   analytics via a Web interface that allows end-users to explore
   neighborhoods dynamics and gain insights for city cross-neighborhood
   patterns and inter-relationships. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose of this study is to examine the trends in retail consumers'
   consumption dynamics and patterns of purchase behavior within this
   new-technology-mediated environment. A behavioral purchase model was
   developed and tested to understand the ways social networks influence
   the decision making of individuals planning to visit a theme park. In
   particular, the proposed model delineates how online social networking
   (OSN) experience factors affect actual use (AU) of social media for
   purchasing of theme park services through an assessment of perceived
   usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU). An electronic survey
   was conducted with members of a theme park's brand fan page on the
   Facebook social media site namely, the E-da World theme park in the
   southern Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung. Smart PLS 3, a partial least
   squares analysis, was employed to examine a series of eleven research
   hypotheses. The findings revealed a series of statistically significant
   influences from five exogenous variables on PU and PEOU, as well as the
   mediating role of PU on the PEOU-AU relationship. The results also
   provide important practical implications both for academics and
   practitioners by shedding light on the way social media works to
   encourage and support online purchasing of amusement services. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper examines the relationship between smart growth policies and
   other social and physical characteristics and the supply of multifamily
   housing units in 202 core-based metropolitan statistical areas (CBSAs)
   in the USA. Data for this study were gathered from the GeoLytics
   Neighborhood Change Database for the 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010 US
   Census. The smart growth characteristics of each CBSA are determined by
   a smart growth index and a catalogue of urban containment rankings,
   while other social and physical characteristics are obtained from the US
   Census. This allows us to examine potential differences in development
   patterns between CBSAs with varying levels of sprawl and growth
   containment policies. Two regression models are used to determine
   statistically significant relationships between multifamily development
   patterns and growth management policies, as well as other social and
   physical characteristics. The results indicate that high levels of
   sprawl are associated with relatively fewer multifamily units,
   especially in suburban areas. In addition, several population
   demographics that may potentially benefit from multifamily units, such
   as senior citizens, the population in poverty and smaller households,
   are less likely to live in areas with higher rates of multifamily units.
   These findings indicate that planners and policymakers should consider
   the needs of more diverse communities when planning for housing,
   especially in suburban areas, where housing diversity is constricted.}},

Abstract = {{Public special events, like sports games, concerts and festivals are
   well known to create disruptions in transportation systems, often
   catching the operators by surprise. Although these are usually planned
   well in advance, their impact is difficult to predict, even when
   organisers and transportation operators coordinate. The problem highly
   increases when several events happen concurrently. To solve these
   problems, costly processes, heavily reliant on manual search and
   personal experience, are usual practice in large cities like Singapore,
   London or Tokyo. This paper presents a Bayesian additive model with
   Gaussian process components that combines smart card records from public
   transport with context information about events that is continuously
   mined from the Web. We develop an efficient approximate inference
   algorithm using expectation propagation, which allows us to predict the
   total number of public transportation trips to the special event areas,
   thereby contributing to a more adaptive transportation system.
   Furthermore, for multiple concurrent event scenarios, the proposed
   algorithm is able to disaggregate gross trip counts into their most
   likely components related to specific events and routine behavior. Using
   real data from Singapore, we show that the presented model outperforms
   the best baseline model by up to 26 percent in R-2 and also has
   explanatory power for its individual components.}},

Abstract = {{A location-aware publish/subscribe (pub/sub) system is gaining more and
   more interest in both industry and academia with the rapid progress of
   mobile Internet and the rising popularity of smart-phones. Nowadays,
   with the booming of E-commerce, OTO (online-to-offline) services are
   gaining more and more popularity, which results in millions of products
   with different structured descriptions and locations. To meet this
   requirement, a pub/sub system should handle subscriptions with
   location-aware boolean expressions to present users' interests. In this
   paper, we propose an efficient location-aware pub/sub index for boolean
   expressions, called RP-trees. RP-trees integrates an R-tree index and a
   boolean expression index together, can efficiently and simultaneously
   prune boolean expressions and spatial dimensions. RP-trees is also
   extensible to support complex environment such as prefix-matching and
   subscriptions in format of CNF and DNF. Our experimental results show
   that RP-trees achieves good performance on a synthetic dataset and two
   real-world datasets (58 city and ebay).}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the major cities of the world have to solve problems that were
   unthinkable in past decades. Due to the population growing rate, new
   issues are still arising, but technology can be used to address such
   issues and improve life quality in big cities. In that scenario,
   surveillance is a highly desired service and most governments are
   already using different types of devices to provide high levels of
   security. Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) can be used to monitor
   every part of a city without the cost of running cables all over it.
   However, there must be an efficient way to gather all information
   collected by the sensors and cameras, with reduced energy consumption
   and average latency. This work proposes a new algorithm to position
   multiple mobile sinks in WVSN deployed along roads and streets. A
   relevance based approach was designed to position sinks closer to source
   nodes with higher sensing relevance, since they are expected to transmit
   more data packets. The proposed algorithm can detect forbidden and
   disconnected zones, making sure sinks will be positioned in permitted
   areas, which makes this approach very suitable for realistic smart city
   applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{73-91}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Supply-demand systems in Smart City sectors such as energy,
   transportation, telecommunication, are subject of unprecedented
   technological transformations by the Internet of Things. Usually, supply
   demand systems involve actors that produce and consume resources, e.g.
   energy, and they are regulated such that supply meets demand, or demand
   meets available supply. Mismatches of supply and demand may increase
   operational costs, can cause catastrophic damage in infrastructure, for
   instance power blackouts, and may even lead to social unrest and
   security threats. Long-term, operationally offline and top-down
   regulatory decision-making by governmental officers, policy makers or
   system operators may turn out to be ineffective for matching
   supply-demand under new dynamics and opportunities that Internet of
   Things technologies bring to supply-demand systems, for instance,
   interactive cyberphysical systems and software agents running locally in
   physical assets to monitor and apply automated control actions in
   real-time. e.g. power flow redistributions by smart transformers to
   improve the Smart Grid reliability. Existing work on online regulatory
   mechanisms of matching supply-demand either focuses on game-theoretic
   solutions with assumptions that cannot be easily met in real-world
   systems or assume centralized management entities and local access to
   global information. This paper contributes a generic decentralized
   self-regulatory framework, which, in contrast to related work, is shaped
   around standardized control system concepts and Internet of Things
   technologies for an easier adoption and applicability. The framework
   involves a decentralized combinatorial optimization mechanism that
   matches supply-demand under different regulatory scenarios. An
   evaluation methodology, integrated within this framework, is introduced
   that allows the systematic assessment of optimality and system
   constraints, resulting in more informative and meaningful comparisons of
   self-regulatory settings. Evidence using real-world datasets of energy
   supply-demand systems confirms the effectiveness and applicability of
   the self-regulatory framework. It is shown that a higher informational
   diversity in the options, from which agents make local selections,
   results in a higher system-wide performance. Several strategies with
   which agents make selections come along with measurable performance
   trade-offs creating a vast potential for online adjustments incentivized
   by utilities, system operators and policy makers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A Smart City is a cyber-physical system improving urban behavior and
   capabilities by providing ICT-based functionalities. An infrastructure
   for Smart City has to be geographically and functionally extensible, as
   it requires both to grow up with the physical environment and to meet
   the increasing in needs and demands of city users/inhabitants. In this
   paper, we propose iSapiens, an IoT-based platform for the development of
   general cyber-physical systems suitable for the design and
   implementation of smart city services and applications. As
   distinguishing features, the iSapiens platform implements the edge
   computing paradigm through both the exploitation of the agent metaphor
   and a distributed network of computing nodes directly scattered in the
   urban environment. The platform promotes the dynamic deployment of new
   computing nodes as well as software agents for addressing geographical
   and functional extensibility. iSapiens provides a set of abstractions
   suitable to hide the heterogeneity of the physical sensing/actuator
   devices embedded in the system, and to support the development of
   complex applications. The paper also furnishes a set of methodological
   guidelines exploitable for the design and implementation of smart city
   applications by properly using iSapiens. As a significant case study,
   the design and implementation of a real Smart Street in the city of
   Cosenza (Italy) are shown, which provides decentralized urban
   intelligence services to citizens. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The new Internet of Things (IoT) applications are enabling Smart City
   initiatives worldwide. It provides the ability to remotely monitor,
   manage and control devices, and to create new insights and actionable
   information from massive streams of real-time data. The main features of
   a smart city include a high degree of information technology integration
   and a comprehensive application of information resources. The essential
   components of urban development for a smart city should include smart
   technology, smart industry, smart services, smart management and smart
   life. The Internet of Things is about installing sensors (RFID, IR, GPS,
   laser scanners, etc.) for everything, and connecting them to the
   internet through specific protocols for information exchange and
   communications, in order to achieve intelligent recognition, location,
   tracking, monitoring and management. With the technical support from
   IoT, smart city need to have three features of being instrumented,
   interconnected and intelligent. Only then a Smart City can be formed by
   integrating all these intelligent features at its advanced stage of IOT
   development. The explosive growth of Smart City and Internet of Things
   applications creates many scientific and engineering challenges that
   call for ingenious research efforts from both academia and industry,
   especially for the development of efficient, scalable, and reliable
   Smart City based on IoT. New protocols, architectures, and services are
   in dire needs to respond for these challenges. The goal of the special
   issue is to bring together scholars, professors, researchers, engineers
   and administrators resorting to the state-of-the-art technologies and
   ideas to significantly improve the field of Smart City based on IoT. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel mobility monitoring system and some of its
   applications to address problems that would be solved in a Smart City,
   such as the optimization of traffic flows in terms of trip-time and
   security (Smart Traffic), and the improvement of security or energetic
   issues inside buildings. The system tracks the movement of people and
   vehicles monitoring the radioelectric space, catching the WiFi and
   Bluetooth signals emitted by personal (smartphones) or on-board
   (hands-free) devices. A study has been conducted in four different real
   scenarios, i.e. with real data gathered by the system: two related with
   people's mobility (a public building and a discotheque); and two focused
   in traffic tracking (urban and intercity roads). The analysis has
   consisted on the application of different data mining techniques to
   extract useful knowledge, traffic forecasting methods to perform
   accurate predictions, and statistical analyses to model and validate the
   system reliability (comparing to other real data sources). The obtained
   results show the viability and utility of the system in all the cases,
   along with some of its multiple applications for solving different
   issues in a city. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As the deployment of Internet of Things and other enabling technologies
   is still in an initial phase worldwide, few research studies have
   addressed the associated business models. This paper aims to fill this
   gap. The main objective of this research is to gain a deeper knowledge
   about practical business models matching into a real-life smart city
   ecosystem. Hence, a benchmarking of eight urban services provided in the
   city of Santander has been carried out: waste management; water supply;
   traffic management; street lighting; augmented reality and tourism;
   incidences management, parks and gardens and citizen participation.
   Among the main results of our study, we highlight that those public
   services properly managed embedding loT technology convey cost
   reductions in the long term. There is also a reduction in energy
   consumption and environmental impact with the consequent social impact.
   It should also be highlighted that most data are managed with the same
   platform. Last but not least, an emerging ecosystem of incentivized
   citizens has been proved to be arising. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The race to achieve smart cities is producing a continuous effort to
   adapt new developments and knowledge, for administrations and citizens.
   Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the
   key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors
   (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within
   the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of
   resources.
   The proliferation of these ``smart things{''} is producing significant
   deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are
   proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they
   provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility
   of these solutions in the current smart city developments.
   This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both
   hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically
   in a university campus. For this integration, GlScience comes into play,
   where it offers different open standards that allow full control over
   ``smart things{''} as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this. To
   test our system, we have deployed a network of different sensorized
   platforms inside the university campus, in order to monitor
   environmental phenomena. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Smart Cities use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to
   manage more efficiently the resources and services offered by a city and
   to make them more approachable to all its stakeholders (citizens,
   companies and public administration). In contrast to the view of big
   corporations promoting holistic ``smart city in a box{''} solutions,
   this work proposes that smarter cities can be achieved by combining
   already available infrastructure, i.e., Open Government Data and sensor
   networks deployed in cities, with the citizens' active contributions
   towards city knowledge by means of their smartphones and the apps
   executed in them. In addition, this work introduces the main
   characteristics of the IES Cities platform, whose goal is to ease the
   generation of citizen-centric apps that exploit urban data in different
   domains. The proposed vision is achieved by providing a common access
   mechanism to the heterogeneous data sources offered by the city, which
   reduces the complexity of accessing the city's data whilst bringing
   citizens closely to a prosumer (double consumer and producer) role and
   allowing to integrate legacy data into the cities' data ecosystem. (C)

Abstract = {{Smart Cities need to be designed to allow the inclusion of all kinds of
   citizens. For instance, motor disabled people like wheelchair users may
   have problems to interact with the city. Internet of Things (IoT)
   technologies provide the tools to include all citizens in the Smart City
   context. For example, wheelchair users may not be able to reach items
   placed beyond their arm's length, limiting their independence in
   everyday activities like shopping, or visiting libraries. We have
   developed a system that enables wheelchair users to interact with items
   placed beyond their arm's length, with the help of Augmented Reality
   (AR) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies. Our
   proposed system is an interactive AR application that runs on different
   interfaces, allowing the user to digitally interact with the physical
   items on the shelf, thanks to an updated inventory provided by an RFID
   system. The resulting experience is close to being able to browse a
   shelf, clicking on it and obtaining information about the items it
   contains, allowing wheelchair users to shop independently, and providing
   autonomy in their everyday activities. Fourteen wheelchair users with
   different degrees of impairment have participated in the study and
   development of the system. The evaluation results show promising results
   towards more independence of wheelchair users, providing an opportunity
   for equality improvement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Smart Cities are advancing towards an instrumented, integrated, and
   intelligent living space, where Internet of Things (IoT), mobile
   technologies and next generation networks are expected to play a key
   role. In smart cities, numerous loT-based services are likely to be
   available and a key challenge is to allow mobile users perform their
   daily tasks dynamically, by integrating the services available in their
   vicinity. Semantic Service Oriented Architectures (SSOA) abstract the
   environment's services and their functionalities as Semantic Web
   Services (SWS). However, existing service composition approaches based
   on SSOA do not support dynamic reasoning on user tasks and service
   behaviours to deal with the heterogeneity of loT domains. In this paper,
   we present an adaptive service composition framework that supports such
   dynamic reasoning. The framework is based on wEASEL, an abstract service
   model representing services and user tasks in terms of their signature,
   specification (i.e., context-aware preconditions, post-conditions and
   effects) and conversation (i.e., behaviour with related data-flow and
   context-flow constraints). To evaluate our composition framework, we
   develop a novel OWLS-TC4-based testbed by combining simple and composite
   services. The evaluation shows that our wEASEL-based system performs
   more accurate composition and allows end-users to discover and
   investigate more composition opportunities than other approaches. (C)

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things is arriving to our homes or cities through fields
   already known like Smart Homes, Smart Cities, or Smart Towns. The
   monitoring of environmental conditions of cities can help to adapt the
   indoor locations of the cities in order to be more comfortable for
   people who stay there. A way to improve the indoor conditions is an
   efficient temperature control, however, it depends on many factors like
   the different combinations of outdoor temperature and humidity.
   Therefore, adjusting the indoor temperature is not setting a value
   according to other value. There are many more factors to take into
   consideration, hence the traditional logic based in binary states cannot
   be used. Many problems cannot be solved with a set of binary solutions
   and we need a new way of development. Fuzzy logic is able to interpret
   many states, more than two states, giving to computers the capacity to
   react in a similar way to people. In this paper we will propose a new
   approach to control the temperature using the Internet of Things
   together its platforms and fuzzy logic regarding not only the indoor
   temperature but also the outdoor temperature and humidity in order to
   save energy and to set a more comfortable environment for their users.
   Finally, we will conclude that the fuzzy approach allows us to achieve
   an energy saving around 40\% and thus, save money. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Pareto optimization for the two-agent scheduling problems with linear

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (loT) enables these objects to collect and
   exchange data and it is an important character of smart city.
   Multi-agent scheduling is one necessary part of Internet of Things. In
   this paper, we investigate the Pareto optimization scheduling on a
   single machine with two competing agents and linear non-increasing
   deterioration, which is Multi-agent scheduling problems often occurred
   in the Internet of Things. In the scheduling setting, each of the two
   competing agents wants to optimize its own objective which depends on
   the completion times of its jobs only. The assumption of linear
   non-increasing deterioration means that the actual processing time of a
   job will decrease linearly with the starting time. The objective
   functions in consideration are the maximum earliness cost and the total
   earliness. Two Pareto optimization scheduling problems are studied in
   this paper. In the first problem, each agent has the maximum earliness
   cost as its objective function. In the second problem, one agent has the
   maximum earliness cost as its objective function and the other agent has
   the total earliness as its objective function. The goal of a Pareto
   optimization scheduling problem is to find all Pareto optimal points
   and, for each Pareto optimal point, a corresponding Pareto optimal
   schedule. In the literature, the two corresponding constrained
   optimization scheduling problems are solved in polynomial time under the
   assumption that the inverse cost function of each job is available. In
   this paper, we extend these results to the setting without the
   availability assumption. Furthermore, by estimating the number of Pareto
   optimal points, we show that the above two Pareto optimization
   scheduling problems are solved in polynomial time. Hence, our results
   have much more theoretically meaningful constructs. Experimentation
   results show that the algorithms presented in this paper are efficient.

Abstract = {{Could we use Computer Vision in the Internet of Things for using
   pictures as sensors? This is the principal hypothesis that we want to
   resolve. Currently, in order to create safety areas, cities, or homes,
   people use IP cameras. Nevertheless, this system needs people who watch
   the camera images, watch the recording after something occurred, or
   watch when the camera notifies them of any movement. These are the
   disadvantages. Furthermore, there are many Smart Cities and Smart Homes
   around the world. This is why we thought of using the idea of the
   Internet of Things to add a way of automating the use of IP cameras. In
   our case, we propose the analysis of pictures through Computer Vision to
   detect people in the analysed pictures. With this analysis, we are able
   to obtain if these pictures contain people and handle the pictures as if
   they were sensors with two possible states. Notwithstanding, Computer
   Vision is a very complicated field. This is why we needed a second
   hypothesis: Could we work with Computer Vision in the Internet of Things
   with a good accuracy to automate or semi-automate this kind of events?
   The demonstration of these hypotheses required a testing over our
   Computer Vision module to check the possibilities that we have to use
   this module in a possible real environment with a good accuracy. Our
   proposal, as a possible solution, is the analysis of entire sequence
   instead of isolated pictures for using pictures as sensors in the
   Internet of Things. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The massive introduction of internet, architect of the Internet of
   Thingsparadigm, was expected to facilitate the spread of people out of
   the urban spaces. However, the reality is that increasingly people are
   moving to cities, which generates many challenges for the cities of
   tomorrow. In this context, the Smart Cityconcept emerges, where
   Information and Communication Technologies have a key role. This
   situation has revealed an important issue that needs to be addressed:
   the lack of an ubiquitous communication architecture able to deal with
   the expected requirements of a SC. To this end, a wide review of the
   existing communication frameworks and city services have been performed,
   which showed that existing proposals are classical fixed ad-hocsolutions
   for very specific problems with no resilience and common thread. By
   rethinking the nature of cities and considering them as living
   organisms, it is possible to relate the nervous systems with the
   communication architecture of a city. Therefore, this work proposes a
   novel communication architecture, ubiquitous and resilient, inspired in
   the human nervous system by the definition of Smart Gateways, able to
   satisfy the needs of a real SCand adaptable to the growing and specific
   requirements of every single city. Additionally, the research also
   includes the simulation of the communication channel with different

Abstract = {{IoV based traffic control at intersections has been recently studied
   widely to realize intelligent transportation. However, existing
   solutions usually suffer from high communication cost, which may cause
   serious packet interference and long time delays. In this paper, we
   design a new algorithm to realize intersection control via vehicular ad
   hoc networking. We basically adopt the approach of mutual exclusion,
   which can let vehicles at an intersection compete for the privilege of
   passing, via message exchange. Different from existing works, we adopt a
   group based privilege competition design. By letting only group head
   handling requests from other lanes, message cost can be significantly
   reduced. Reducing communication cost is a significant issue in IoV based
   intersection control because high communication cost will cause packet
   interference and packet losses, which further result in safety problems.
   The key challenges lie in deterring group size and recognizing group
   head. Compared similar works, our new algorithm can conduct intersection
   control with much less message cost, and its advantage is validated by
   simulations using ns3. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid growth of Internet services in smart cities, large
   network flow has caused network congestion among users, thereby
   deteriorating network service quality and user experience. In this
   study, a distributed proxy cache management platform based on autonomous
   decision is proposed. The platform realizes highly efficient automatic
   cache management by taking the advantages of autonomous perception and
   decision. First, the platform establishes the autonomous management
   framework of proxy cache on the basis of the idea of feedback loop.
   Next, the URL is distributed evenly among cache nodes through the hash
   ring storage mechanism with virtual nodes. Cache status adjustment
   strategies are made based on historical status sequences and the gray
   prediction model. A method that is used to predict content hot-rank
   based on domain name set is proposed to reduce loads of cache nodes.
   Second, the platform designs a distributed proxy cache management system
   by depending on the autonomous management framework of proxy cache and
   the cache management mechanism of autonomous decision, and the Cache Hot
   Spots Migrate algorithm is suggested for the dynamic migration and
   integration of virtual nodes on the hash ring. A system knowledge base
   is established through status sequence and corresponding adjustment

Title = {{Object detection among multimedia big data in the compressive

Abstract = {{Multimedia big data is difficult to handle because of its enormous
   amount and the elusive property of underlying information. To study how
   to explore valuable information among multimedia big data with low
   complexity, this paper proposes an object detection method of big data,
   which is in compressive measurement domain under a mobile distributed
   computing architecture. It includes the sparse representation and object
   detection processes. Considering the unbalanced computation capacity
   between a mobile center cloud and mobile edge sites, we shift large
   storage burden into the cloud, while performing the dictionary learning
   by using compressive measurements in the mobile edge sites.
   Specifically, after getting the measurements at the edge sites, we
   perform dictionary learning to obtain the sparse representation in pixel
   domain, then select significant images and their feature vectors to be
   stored in the center cloud. In addition, we also analyze the trained
   dictionary in the measurement domain employing measurements. In order to
   reveal the two kinds of dictionaries' relationship, we conduct a
   formulation process into each of them and find that the relationship
   depends on the uniqueness relation between the original signal and the
   sparse coefficient in the measurement domain. At the same time, we keep
   coefficients for a certain time period at the mobile edge sites in order
   to realize real time object detection, taking the advantage of low
   latency of the mobile edge computing ends. Since the sparse coefficients
   and the original signal have a one-to-one correspondence relationship,
   we can just search for the matched coefficients of the image block for
   detecting object. Experimental results show that Hadamard measurement
   matrix can better preserve the characteristics of the original signal
   than Gaussian matrix and that the proposed method can achieve a
   favorable detection performance. Meanwhile, the computation cost and
   storage cost of the proposed detection process can be significantly
   reduced compared with traditional methods, which is suitable for the
   multimedia big data. This can also be used in smart cities for looking
   for lost children and other specific events. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{With the growing popularity of Internet of Things (loT) technologies and
   sensors deployment, more and more cities are leaning towards smart
   cities solutions that can leverage this rich source of streaming data to
   gather knowledge that can be used to solve domain-specific problems. A
   key challenge that needs to be faced in this respect is the ability to
   automatically discover and integrate heterogeneous sensor data streams
   on the fly for applications to use them. To provide a domain-independent
   platform and take full benefits from semantic technologies, in this
   paper we present an Automated Complex Event Implementation System
   (ACEIS), which serves as a middleware between sensor data streams and
   smart city applications. ACEIS not only automatically discovers and
   composes IoT streams in urban infrastructures for users' requirements
   expressed as complex event requests, but also automatically generates
   stream queries in order to detect the requested complex events, bridging
   the gap between high-level application users and low-level information
   sources. We also demonstrate the use of ACEIS in a smart travel planner
   scenario using real-world sensor devices and datasets. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{The recently coined Internet of Things (loT) paradigm leverages a large
   volume of heterogeneous Network Elements (NEs) demanding broad
   connectivity anywhere, anytime and anyhow, fueling the deployment of
   innovative Internet services, such as Cloud or Fog Computing, Data
   Center Networks (DCN5), Smart Cities or Smart Transportation. The proper
   deployment of these novel Internet services is imposing hard
   connectivity constraints, such as high transmission capacity, reliable
   communications, as well as an efficient control scheme capable of
   enabling an agile coordination of actions in large heterogeneous
   scenarios. In recent years, novel control schemes, such as the so-called
   Path Computation Element (PCE) has gained momentum in the network
   research community turning into real PCE implementations. Indeed, there
   is a wealth of studies assessing the PCE performance, clearly showing
   the potential benefits of decoupling routing control tasks from the
   forwarding nodes. Nevertheless, recognized the need for a control
   solution in IoT scenarios, there is not much published information
   analyzing PCE benefits in these loT scenarios. In this paper, we distill
   how the PCE may gracefully provide for service composition in an agile
   manner, handling the specific constraints and requirements found in loT
   scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel PCE strategy referred to as
   Service Oriented PCE (SPCE), which enables network-aware service
   composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) in today's smart environments has many
   applications in gerontology, health care, transportation, and smart
   cities. Many challenges still exist in developing IoT-based smart
   environments. Dynamic generation of action strategies based on multiple
   IoT object's input is one of the major challenges. In this paper,
   stochastic Petri nets and game theory are combined to create stochastic
   game nets (SGNs) for IoT-based smart environment where each IoT device
   acts as a player with predefined place and action sets. Complete SGN
   will be created dynamically using individual sensor SGNs which will make
   IoT-based smart environments highly interoperable and scalable. Proposed
   model is used to predict activities performed by two-single person in
   their respective home with more than 70 sensors. Simulation results show
   suitability of proposed model in smart environments. Proposed model is
   tested for smart homes, but it can be used in any IoT-based smart

   waste heat on the DH supply was also assessed. In the reference year
   (2013) two out of four interconnections proved to be economically
   viable. The results for the future energy system (2029) showed that
   interconnecting geographically distributed DH grids reduces primary
   energy supply by 9.5\%, CO2 emissions by 11.1\% and total system costs
   by 6.3\%. Inclusion of industrial waste heat in the fully interconnected
   DH grid reduced primary energy supply for an additional 3\%, CO2
   emissions for an additional 2.2\% and total system costs for an
   additional 1.3\%. The case of the future energy supply system with
   interconnected DH grids and installed industrial waste heat recuperation
   results in the lowest primary energy demand, emissions and costs.
   Finally, the benefits of the interconnected DH grid, in terms of system
   flexibility, CO2 emissions, total costs and energy efficiency, proved to
   be much greater in the future energy system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Future district heating systems (so called 4th Generation District
   Heating (4GDH) systems) have to address challenges such as integration
   of (de)centralized renewable energy sources and storage, low system
   temperatures and high fluctuation of the supply temperature. This paper
   presents a novel framework for representing and simplifying on-grid
   energy systems as well as for dynamic thermohydraulic simulation and
   optimization of district heating and cooling systems. We describe
   physically precise and numerically robust models for simulation and
   continuous optimization. Futthermore, we propose a novel method to
   decompose a mixed-integer-optimal control problem into two sub-problems,
   separating the discrete part from the continuous. Two use cases show the
   applicability of the framework. An existing district heating system,
   with more than 100 consumers is adapted to test the framework based on
   simulation requirements of 4GDH systems. The second case presents the
   continuous optimization of a district heating system in a virtual city
   district. A main advantage of combining equation based modelling and
   nonlinear optimization is the possibility of including model coherences
   based on physical laws into the optimization formulation. Results show
   that the framework is well-suited for simulating larger scale 4GDH
   systems and that the solution time of the continuous optimization
   problem is sufficiently low for real-time applications. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{The aim of this letter is to raise some critical concerns and gaps in
   the booming literature on Smart Cities; concerns that we think deserve
   greater attention from scientists, policy makers and urban planners.
   Using an urban ecology lens, we provide some reflections that need to
   forgo any wider-scale implementation of the Smart City-model with the
   goal to enhance urban sustainability. We discuss that the Smart City
   literature must better include analysis around social sustainability
   issues for city dwellers. Focus here should start on health issues and
   more critical analysis about whom the Smart City is for. Also, the
   literature must address issues of resilience and cyber security,
   including how Smart City solutions may affect the autonomy of urban
   governance, personal integrity and how it may affect the resilience of
   infrastructures that provide inhabitants with basic needs, such as food,
   energy and water security. A third major gap in this literature is how
   smart city developments may change human-nature relations. Focus here
   should start on how Smart City technologies may hinder or support
   children's learning towards a stronger psychological connection with
   nature. Discussions are also needed on how the Smart City model may
   affect pro-environmental behavior more broadly. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Industry is double-edge sword to urban sustainability: on the one hand,
   it provides employment and GDP economic, one the other hand, brings
   pollutions to cities. The concept of urban industrial symbiosis offers a
   smart solution for city to coordinate the relationship among industries
   and between industry and city. While internationally, this idea has been
   promoted more than two decades, in China, which is ideal laboratory to
   test such practices, related research is rather few, especially
   quantitative studies. With this circumstance, this study conducts a case
   study to test the urban industrial symbiosis promotion in one typical
   industrial city named Liuzhou, in southern China, of which heavy
   industries play an important role. A hybrid evaluation model integrating
   process based life cycle assessment (LCA) and input-output (IO) model is
   established to assess the environmental benefits in the whole supply
   chain. Based on local conditions, innovative urban industrial symbiosis
   is designed and analyzed. Five new waste/energy synergies named waste
   plastics recycling, scrap tire recycling, coal flying ash recycling,
   biomass utilization and carbon capture by slag carbonization are
   selected for scenarios analysis. We particular focus on the carbon
   mitigations. Compared with business as usual scenario, planned symbiosis
   enables to reduce CO2 emissions by 29.66, 557.42 and 520.13 kt-CO2/year
   in power purchase, material consumption and waste disposal stage.
   Results highlight that urban industrial symbiosis is not only able to
   green the industries, but also utilize industry contribute to urban
   development. Finally, policy implications and countermeasures to address
   the barriers of promoting the urban industrial symbiosis are discussed.
   Our research would be critical for future sustainable urban planning and
   shed a light on regional eco-industrial development in China. (C) 2017

Title = {{Communicating the promise, risks, and ethics of large-scale, open space
   microbiome and metagenome research}},
Journal = {{MICROBIOME}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 4}},
Abstract = {{The public commonly associates microorganisms with pathogens. This
   suspicion of microorganisms is understandable, as historically
   microorganisms have killed more humans than any other agent while
   remaining largely unknown until the late seventeenth century with the
   works of van Leeuwenhoek and Kircher. Despite our improved understanding
   regarding microorganisms, the general public are apt to think of
   diseases rather than of the majority of harmless or beneficial species
   that inhabit our bodies and the built and natural environment. As long
   as microbiome research was confined to labs, the public's exposure to
   microbiology was limited. The recent launch of global microbiome
   surveys, such as the Earth Microbiome Project and MetaSUB (Metagenomics
   and Metadesign of Subways and Urban Biomes) project, has raised ethical,
   financial, feasibility, and sustainability concerns as to the public's
   level of understanding and potential reaction to the findings, which,
   done improperly, risk negative implications for ongoing and future
   investigations, but done correctly, can facilitate a new vision of
   ``smart cities.{''} To facilitate improved future research, we describe
   here the major concerns that our discussions with ethics committees,
   community leaders, and government officials have raised, and we expound
   on how to address them. We further discuss ethical considerations of
   microbiome surveys and provide practical recommendations for public
   engagement.}},

Title = {{Guiding cities to pursue a smart mobility paradigm: An example from
   vehicle routing guidance and its traffic and operational effects}},
Journal = {{RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS}},

Abstract = {{The concept of `smart cities' is rooted on the approach taken by cities
   to reconcile the three often conflicting objectives of economic
   efficiency, environmental quality and social equity. The expectation
   that smart cities may promote the adoption of scalable solutions that
   take advantage of information and communication technologies (ICT) to
   increase their effectiveness, reduce costs and to improve the quality of
   life is great among academia, business and governmental stakeholders.
   Traffic management systems in its multiple applications (including
   re-routing) are an example of ICT solutions that can expectably lead to
   the purpose pursued by `smart cities'. This paper develops a performance
   evaluation of re-routing for passenger and commercial vehicles with a
   case study in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. The paper examines how the
   provision of guidance information to drivers affects traffic
   performance, operational costs and environmental conditions at different
   spatial references, namely route level and urban network level. The
   simulation results indicate that the re-routing can not only reduce
   travel times, but also enhance the efficiency of roads in the city
   network and as well the traffic performance at the route level of
   analysis. The improvement at local route levels (such as corridor/route)
   is more significant than at the city network level. For the urban
   network level, simulation results suggest that re-routing can bring
   variations in travel and delays that may reach 2\% and 6\%,
   respectively, when a 10\% drivers' compliance rate is considered.
   Individual drivers are more likely to comply to deviate than urban
   logistics drivers and bus drivers. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{As visions of smart urbanism gain traction around the world, it is
   crucial that we question the benefits that an increasingly technologised
   urbanity promise. It is not about the technology, but bettering peoples'
   lives, insist smart city advocates. In this paper, I question the
   progressive potential of the smart city drawing on the case of
   Singapore's Smart Nation initiative. Using the case studies of the smart
   home and `learning to code' movement, I highlight the limits of such
   `smart' interventions as they are stunted by the
   neoliberal-developmental logics of the state, thereby facilitating
   authoritarian consolidation in Singapore. As such, this paper
   distinguishes itself from previous works on the neoliberal smart city by
   situated smart urbanism within the socio-political dynamics of
   neoliberalism-as-developmental strategy. For smart urbanism to better
   peoples' everyday lives, technological `solutionism' needs to be
   replaced with more human-centric framings and understandings of urban
   challenges.}},

Journal = {{COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{668-684}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We are living in an increasingly interdependent and crisis hit
   globalized world, not least in Europe, including Central and Eastern
   Europe. Many Hungarian local communities feel that they lost rather than
   gained from the political transition of the early nineties and the
   socio-economic development in Hungary over the last twenty-five years,
   as the country has opened up to globalization and joined European Union
   integration processes. These people are marginalized and lack both
   material and non-material stability due to unemployment, the erosion of
   social ties and scarcity of resources. In this research article, our
   first assumption is that there is a way out of this desperate situation
   even for local communities living in the poorest, most neglected rural
   or urban areas. Escaping the poverty trap requires creative and
   innovative self-help, trust and solidarity to be sustainable in the long
   term. The second assumption is that some self-help communities can
   successfully be maintained largely in cities (by means of `favour' or
   time banks), while others (using micro-credit or self-sustaining
   community models) can effectively operate only in rural areas, which can
   then be followed by other communities as models of best practice.
   Looking beyond these differences, the common feature of these
   community-based models is that they represent forms of social or
   solidarity economy. To build up and then sustain these models in the
   long run, the local community, and especially their leaders, should be
   supported by high levels of social capital, most importantly trust, as
   the quintessential element of social capital.}},

Abstract = {{Smart card payment systems provide a convenient billing mechanism for
   public transportation providers and passengers. In this paper, a smart
   card-based transit log is used to reveal functionally related regions in
   a city, which are called zones. To discover significant zones based on
   the transit log data, two algorithms, minimum spanning trees and
   agglomerative hierarchical clustering, are extended by considering the
   additional factors of geographical distance and adjacency. The
   hierarchical spatial geocoding system, called Geohash, is adopted to
   merge nearby bus stops to a region before zone discovery. We identify
   different urban zones that contain functionally interrelated regions
   based on passenger trip data stored in the smart card-based transit log
   by manipulating the level of abstraction and the adjustment parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper contributes to the literature on social sustainability in
   urban governance, with a focus on how this concept may be integrated
   into a Smart City strategy, so that excessive enthusiasm for smart
   technologies does not lead to neglect of the social implications of
   certain policies or programmes. By relying on a case study-based
   analysis, this work explores the path followed by the municipal
   government of Milan, and shows that integration of social sustainability
   into the Smart City strategy can be pursued by focusing both on the
   `content' and the `process' of strategy building. Rather than playing a
   strong leadership role, the planning department on the internal front
   and the entire municipality on the external front have chosen a role
   based on co-creation with citizens and other relevant stakeholders. The
   benefits of this approach may include the bottom-up character of several
   projects, better responsiveness and greater opportunities for different
   categories of actors; the drawbacks may include greater difficulty in
   ensuring that certain objective are reached (e.g. in terms of fairness
   and representativeness) and a higher risk of the dispersion of
   resources. This case also points to the difficulty of assessing the
   social sustainability of multiple rather than individual projects and
   programmes combined in a Smart City strategy: projects may reinforce
   each other in their social impact, or otherwise hinder possible
   benefits; also, a municipality may choose a combination of smart
   projects and programmes that attach different weights to economic,
   environmental and social sustainability objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable drainage systems are an alternative and holistic approach to
   conventional urban stormwater management that use and enhance natural
   processes to mimic pre-development hydrology, adding a number of
   well-recognized, although not so often quantified benefits. However,
   transitions towards regenerative urban built environments that widely
   incorporate sustainable drainage systems are ``per se{''} innovative
   journeys that encounter barriers which include the limited evidence on
   the performance of these systems which, in many countries, are still
   unknown to professionals and decision makers. A further important
   barrier is the frequently poor interaction among stakeholders; key items
   such as sustainable drainage systems provide collective benefits which
   also demand collective efforts. With the aim of overcoming such
   innovation-driven barriers, six showcase projects (including rain
   gardens acting as infiltration basins, swales and a green roof) to
   demonstrate the feasibility and suitability of sustainable drainage
   systems were developed and/or retrofitted in two cities of the Valencian
   region of Spain as a part of an European project, and their performance
   was monitored for a year. The data acquired, after being fully analyzed
   and presented to a group of key regional stakeholders, is proving to be
   a valuable promoter of the desired transition (for instance in
   influencing the support to SuDS in recent regional legislation). This
   paper presents detailed data on how these urban ecological drainage
   infrastructure elements reduce runoff (peak flows and volumes) and
   improve its quality, contributing to the goal of healthier and livable
   cities. The data show that the pilots have good hydraulic performance
   under a typical Mediterranean climate and also provided water quality
   benefits. Furthermore, it shows how engagement can contribute to smarter
   governance in the sense of smoothing the difficulties faced by
   innovation when being presented, understood, and endorsed by
   professionals and decision-makers in the field of stormwater management.
   Finally, activities undertaken in the demonstration sites monitored,
   show how they have been drivers of innovation and transition towards a
   new stormwater paradigm in Spain, serving as a reference to other urban
   areas in the Mediterranean. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to connect billions of smart objects
   to the Internet, which can bring a promising future to smart cities.
   These objects are expected to generate large amounts of data and send
   the data to the cloud for further processing, especially for knowledge
   discovery, in order that appropriate actions can be taken. However, in
   reality sensing all possible data items captured by a smart object and
   then sending the complete captured data to the cloud is less useful.
   Further, such an approach would also lead to resource wastage (e.g.,
   network, storage, etc.). The Fog (Edge) computing paradigm has been
   proposed to counterpart the weakness by pushing processes of knowledge
   discovery using data analytics to the edges. However, edge devices have
   limited computational capabilities. Due to inherited strengths and
   weaknesses, neither Cloud computing nor Fog computing paradigm addresses
   these challenges alone. Therefore, both paradigms need to work together
   in order to build a sustainable IoT infrastructure for smart cities. In
   this article, we review existing approaches that have been proposed to
   tackle the challenges in the Fog computing domain. Specifically, we
   describe several inspiring use case scenarios of Fog computing, identify
   ten key characteristics and common features of Fog computing, and
   compare more than 30 existing research efforts in this domain. Based on
   our review, we further identify several major functionalities that ideal
   Fog computing platforms should support and a number of open challenges
   toward implementing them, to shed light on future research directions on
   realizing Fog computing for building sustainable smart cities.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{LoRaWAN is a flagship Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology
   that has highly attracted much attention from the community in recent
   years. Many LoRaWAN end-devices, such as sensors or actuators, are
   expected not to be powered by the electricity grid; therefore, it is
   crucial to investigate the energy consumption of LoRaWAN. However,
   published works have only focused on this topic to a limited extent. In
   this paper, we present analytical models that allow the characterization
   of LoRaWAN end-device current consumption, lifetime and energy cost of
   data delivery. The models, which have been derived based on measurements
   on a currently prevalent LoRaWAN hardware platform, allow us to quantify
   the impact of relevant physical and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer
   LoRaWAN parameters and mechanisms, as well as Bit Error Rate (BER) and
   collisions, on energy performance. Among others, evaluation results show
   that an appropriately configured LoRaWAN end-device platform powered by
   a battery of 2400 mAh can achieve a 1-year lifetime while sending one
   message every 5 min, and an asymptotic theoretical lifetime of 6 years
   for infrequent communication.}},

Title = {{An Anomalous Noise Events Detector for Dynamic Road Traffic Noise
   Mapping in Real-Life Urban and Suburban Environments}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{One of the main aspects affecting the quality of life of people living
   in urban and suburban areas is their continued exposure to high Road
   Traffic Noise (RTN) levels. Until now, noise measurements in cities have
   been performed by professionals, recording data in certain locations to
   build a noise map afterwards. However, the deployment of Wireless
   Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) has enabled automatic noise mapping in
   smart cities. In order to obtain a reliable picture of the RTN levels
   affecting citizens, Anomalous Noise Events (ANE) unrelated to road
   traffic should be removed from the noise map computation. To this aim,
   this paper introduces an Anomalous Noise Event Detector (ANED) designed
   to differentiate between RTN and ANE in real time within a predefined
   interval running on the distributed low-cost acoustic sensors of a WASN.
   The proposed ANED follows a two-class audio event detection and
   classification approach, instead of multi-class or one-class
   classification schemes, taking advantage of the collection of
   representative acoustic data in real-life environments. The experiments
   conducted within the DYNAMAP project, implemented on ARM-based acoustic
   sensors, show the feasibility of the proposal both in terms of
   computational cost and classification performance using standard Mel
   cepstral coefficients and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The two-class
   GMM core classifier relatively improves the baseline universal GMM
   one-class classifier F1 measure by 18.7\% and 31.8\% for suburban and
   urban environments, respectively, within the 1-s integration interval.
   Nevertheless, according to the results, the classification performance
   of the current ANED implementation still has room for improvement.}},

   leakage and the communication is error-free. An energy harvesting sensor
   can transmit data to the fusion center whenever being scheduled only if
   it has enough energy for data transmission. We investigate average
   throughput of Round-Robin type myopic policy both analytically and
   numerically under an average reward (throughput) criterion. We show that
   Round-Robin type myopic policy achieves optimality for some class of
   energy harvesting processes although it is suboptimal for a broad class
   of energy harvesting processes.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are becoming increasingly popular since
   they can gather information from different locations without wires. This
   advantage is exploited in applications such as robotic systems,
   telecare, domotic or smart cities, among others. To gain independence
   from the electricity grid, WSNs devices are equipped with batteries,
   therefore their operational time is determined by the time that the
   batteries can power on the device. As a consequence, engineers must
   consider low energy consumption as a critical objective to design WSNs.
   Several approaches can be taken to make efficient use of energy in WSNs,
   for instance low-duty-cycling sensor networks (LDC-WSN). Based on the
   LDC-WSNs, we present LOKA, a LOw power Konsumption Algorithm to minimize
   WSNs energy consumption using different power modes in a sensor mote.
   The contribution of the work is a novel algorithm called LOKA that
   implements two duty-cycling mechanisms using the end-device of the
   ZigBee protocol (of the Application Support Sublayer) and an external
   microcontroller (Cortex M0+) in order to minimize the energy consumption
   of a delay tolerant networking. Experiments show that using LOKA, the
   energy required by the sensor device is reduced to half with respect to
   the same sensor device without using LOKA.}},

Title = {{Developing Policy Scenarios for Sustainable Urban Growth Management: A
   Delphi Approach}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In many parts of the world, a rapid urbanization process is taking place
   at an unprecedented scale, and its drastic impacts on societies and the
   environment are evident. To combat the externalities of such rapid, and
   to a degree uncontrolled, development, many cities around the globe
   introduced various urban growth management policies. However, policy
   makingto provide sustainable outcomes, while generating growth
   opportunitieshas been a daunting task for urban administrators. To ease
   the task, scenario-based planning methods are introduced to produce
   alternative visions for managing urban growth in sustainable ways by
   incorporating various socio-environmental issues. However, even though
   modelling urban growth and associated impacts based on these scenarios
   have emerged to strengthen and quantify the future of urban policies and
   related planning actions, this process has a number of glitches. Major
   issues include the uncertainties associated with the selection of
   suitable methods to generate scenarios, identify indicators to be used
   to assess scenarios, evaluate scenarios to prioritize for policy
   formulation, and assess the impacts of policy scenarios. This paper aims
   to address the challenge of developing suitable policy scenarios for
   sustainable urban growth. As for the methodological approach, the study
   undertakes a thorough review of the literature and current practices,
   and conducts a two-round Delphi surveyinvolving experts from public,
   private and academic sectors specialized in the fields of urban
   planning, environmental planning, social planning, transportation
   modelling, and economic development. The expert driven policy scenarios
   are validated in a local context by comparing findings against the
   policy options as proposed in the South East Queensland Regional Plan
   2017 (Australia). The findings offer valuable guidelines for planners,
   modellers, and policy makers in adopting suitable methods, indicators,
   and policy priorities, and thus, easing the daunting task of generating
   sustainable policy solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Fog/edge computing has been proposed to be integrated with Internet of
   Things (IoT) to enable computing services devices deployed at network
   edge, aiming to improve the user's experience and resilience of the
   services in case of failures. With the advantage of distributed
   architecture and close to end-users, fog/edge computing can provide
   faster response and greater quality of service for IoT applications.
   Thus, fog/edge computing-based IoT becomes future infrastructure on IoT
   development. To develop fog/edge computing-based IoT infrastructure, the
   architecture, enabling techniques, and issues related to IoT should be
   investigated first, and then the integration of fog/edge computing and
   IoT should be explored. To this end, this paper conducts a comprehensive
   overview of IoT with respect to system architecture, enabling
   technologies, security and privacy issues, and present the integration
   of fog/edge computing and IoT, and applications. Particularly, this
   paper first explores the relationship between cyber-physical systems and
   IoT, both of which play important roles in realizing an intelligent
   cyber-physical world. Then, existing architectures, enabling
   technologies, and security and privacy issues in IoT are presented to
   enhance the understanding of the state of the art IoT development. To
   investigate the fog/edge computing-based IoT, this paper also
   investigate the relationship between IoT and fog/edge computing, and
   discuss issues in fog/edge computing-based IoT. Finally, several
   applications, including the smart grid, smart transportation, and smart
   cities, are presented to demonstrate how fog/edge computing-based IoT to

Abstract = {{The development of technologies related to the Internet of Things (IoT)
   provides a new perspective on applications pertaining to smart cities.
   Smart city applications focus on resolving issues facing people in
   everyday life, and have attracted a considerable amount of research
   interest. The typical issue encountered in such places of daily use,
   such as stations, shopping malls, and stadiums is crowd dynamics
   management. Therefore, we focus on crowd dynamics management to resolve
   the problem of congestion using IoT technologies. Real-time crowd
   dynamics management can be achieved by gathering information relating to
   congestion and propose less crowded places. Although many crowd dynamics
   management applications have been proposed in various scenarios and many
   models have been devised to this end, a general model for evaluating the
   control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management has not yet been
   developed in IoT research. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model
   to evaluate the performance of crowd dynamics management applications.
   In other words, the objective of this paper is to present the
   proof-of-concept of control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management.
   Our model uses feedback control theory, and enables an integrated
   evaluation of the control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management
   methods under various scenarios. We also provide extensive numerical
   results to verify the effectiveness of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Internet of things (IOT) is emerging as sensing paradigms in many
   domain-specific monitoring applications in smart cities, such as
   structural health monitoring (SHM) and smart grid monitoring. Due to the
   large size of the monitoring objects (e.g., civil structure or the power
   grid), plenty of sensors need to be deployed and organized to be a large
   scale of multihop wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which tends to have
   quite high transmission cost. In-network processing is an efficient way
   to reduce the transmission cost in WSNs. However, implementing
   in-network processing for above domain-specific monitoring usually
   requires to losslessly distribute a dedicate domain-specific algorithm
   into WSNs, which is much different from most existing in-network
   processing works. This paper conducts a case study of a classic
   centralized SHM algorithm, i.e., eigensystem realization algorithm
   (ERA), and shows how to losslessly and optimally in-network process ERA,
   especially the typical feature extraction method, i.e., that is singular
   value decomposition (SVD) therein, in a WSN. Based on whether the
   intermediate data can be processed together or not by sensor nodes, we
   respectively implement tree-based in-network processing of SVD and
   chain-based in-network processing of SVD in WSNs. We prove that using an
   appropriate shallowlight tree as routes for tree-based in-network
   processing of SVD, can achieve the approximation ratio 1 + root 2 (in
   terms of transmission cost), while for the chain-based in-network
   processing of SVD, we design two efficient heuristic algorithms for
   searching the optimal routes. Extensive simulation results validate the
   efficiency of these proposed schemes that are customized for SVD-based
   IOT applications.}},

Abstract = {{Data intensive analysis is the major challenge in smart cities because
   of the ubiquitous deployment of various kinds of sensors. The natural
   characteristic of geodistribution requires a new computing paradigm to
   offer location-awareness and latency-sensitive monitoring and
   intelligent control. Fog Computing that extends the computing to the
   edge of network, fits this need. In this paper, we introduce a
   hierarchical distributed Fog Computing architecture to support the
   integration of massive number of infrastructure components and services
   in future smart cities. To secure future communities, it is necessary to
   integrate intelligence in our Fog Computing architecture, e.g., to
   perform data representation and feature extraction, to identify
   anomalous and hazardous events, and to offer optimal responses and
   controls. We analyze case studies using a smart pipeline monitoring
   system based on fiber optic sensors and sequential learning algorithms
   to detect events threatening pipeline safety. A working prototype was
   constructed to experimentally evaluate event detection performance of
   the recognition of 12 distinct events. These experimental results
   demonstrate the feasibility of the system's city-wide implementation in
   the future.}},

Abstract = {{The need to develop policies that improve energy and environmental
   sustainability as well as technological innovation is the basis for the
   increase of the smartness of cities around the world. In the European
   Union, protocols were developed to measure the smartness of cities
   through indicators. These indicators however are tailored for large
   cities and do not fit the case of small cities in a satisfactory way.
   The paper develops a methodology for assessing smartness through
   indicators that is applicable to small and medium-size cities. The
   choice of the indicators is consistent with the ISO 37120 standard and
   it is inspired by the environmental indicators used in the Sustainable
   Energy Action Plan of the EU. The proposed methodology could be seen as
   an expansion of Governance strategies already partially adopted by many
   cities. The methodology is applied to 3 municipalities of northern Italy
   and the results obtained are discussed in the paper.}},

Title = {{Wi-Fi based city users' behaviour analysis for smart city}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISUAL LANGUAGES AND COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring, understanding and predicting city user behaviour (hottest
   places, trajectories, flows, etc.) is one the major topics in the
   context of Smart City management. People flow surveillance provides
   valuable information about city conditions, useful not only for
   monitoring and controlling the environmental conditions, but also to
   optimize the delivering of city services (security, clean,
   transport,..). In this context, it is mandatory to develop methods and
   tools for assessing people behaviour in the city. This paper presents a
   methodology to instrument the city via the placement of Wi-Fi Access
   Points, AP, and to use them as sensors to capture and understand city
   user behaviour with a significant precision rate (the understanding of
   city user behaviour is concretized with the computing of heat-maps,
   origin destination matrices and predicting user density). The first
   issue is the positioning of Wi-Fi AP in the city, thus a comparative
   analyses have been conducted with respect to the real data (i.e., cab
   traces) of the city of San Francisco. Several different positioning
   methodologies of APs have been proposed and compared, to minimize the
   cost of AP installation with the aim of producing the best origin
   destination matrices. In a second phase, the methodology was adopted to
   select suitable AP in the city of Florence (Italy), with the aim of
   observing city users behaviour. The obtained instrumented Firenze Wi-Fi
   network collected data for 6 months. The data has been analysed with
   data mining techniques to infer similarity patterns in AP area and
   related time series. The resulting model has been validated and used for
   predicting the number of AP accesses that is also related to number of
   city users. The research work described in this paper has been conducted
   in the scope of the EC funded Horizon 2020 project Resolute
   (http://www.resolute-eu.org ), for early warning and city resilience.

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A study of spatial variability of PM10 elemental components was
   conducted in Terni city (Central Italy), situated in an intramountain
   depression characterized by the presence of several particulate matter
   emission sources. The meteorological conditions of the Terni basin limit
   the dispersion and enhance the accumulation of atmospheric pollutants.
   Thanks to the utilization of new smart samplers, used for the first time
   and working in parallel at 23 sampling sites, spatially resolved data
   were obtained. Localizations of the samplers were chosen in order to
   evaluate the impact of different local PM10 sources. Chemical
   composition of the samples was determined in combination with a chemical
   fractioning procedure that allowed us to discriminate water-soluble and
   residual fractions of analyzed elements in which proved to be a valuable
   approach for increasing selectivity of elements as source tracers.
   Spatial variability of elements underlined the contribution of local
   emission sources and the different dispersion capacity of each element.
   The city of Terni resulted to be an ideal area to test and validate a
   new experimental method for the acquisition of spatially resolved data
   providing the possibility to properly evaluate the spatial variability
   of PM10 and its chemical components.}},

   Identification and Analysis of Electricity Consumption Behaviors}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The large amount of data collected by smart meters is a valuable
   resource that can be used to better understand consumer behavior and
   optimize electricity consumption in cities. This paper presents an
   unsupervised classification approach for extracting typical consumption
   patterns from data generated by smart electric meters. The proposed
   approach is based on a constrained Gaussian mixture model whose
   parameters vary according to the day type (weekday, Saturday or Sunday).
   The proposed methodology is applied to a real dataset of Irish
   households collected by smart meters over one year. For each cluster,
   the model provides three consumption profiles that depend on the day
   type. In the first instance, the model is applied on the electricity
   consumption of users during one month to extract groups of consumers who
   exhibit similar consumption behaviors. The clustering results are then
   crossed with contextual variables available for the households to show
   the close links between electricity consumption and household
   socio-economic characteristics. At the second instance, the evolution of
   the consumer behavior from one month to another is assessed through
   variations of cluster sizes over time. The results show that the
   consumer behavior evolves over time depending on the contextual
   variables such as temperature fluctuations and calendar events.}},

Abstract = {{The number of connected devices is increasing worldwide. Not only in
   contexts like the Smart City, but also in rural areas, to provide
   advanced features like smart farming or smart logistics. Thus, wireless
   network technologies to efficiently allocate Internet of Things (IoT)
   and Machine to Machine (M2M) communications are necessary. Traditional
   cellular networks like Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) are
   widely used worldwide for IoT environments. Nevertheless, Low Power Wide
   Area Networks (LP-WAN) are becoming widespread as infrastructure for
   present and future IoT and M2M applications. Based also on a
   subscription service, the LP-WAN technology SIGFOX((TM)) may compete
   with cellular networks in the M2M and IoT communications market, for
   instance in those projects where deploying the whole communications
   infrastructure is too complex or expensive. For decision makers to
   decide the most suitable technology for each specific application,
   signal coverage is within the key features. Unfortunately, besides
   simulated coverage maps, decision-makers do not have real coverage maps
   for SIGFOX((TM)), as they can be found for cellular networks. Thereby,
   we propose Internet of THings Area Coverage Analyzer (ITHACA), a signal
   analyzer prototype to provide automated signal coverage maps and
   analytics for LP-WAN. Experiments performed in the Gran Canaria Island,
   Spain (with both urban and complex topographic rural environments),
   returned a real SIGFOX((TM)) service availability above 97\% and above
   11\% more coverage with respect to the company-provided simulated maps.
   We expect that ITHACA may help decision makers to deploy the most
   suitable technologies for future IoT and M2M projects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel model for the optimal design and power
   management of a microgrid. The key objective of the proposed model is to
   indicate the benefits of cooperation in terms of energy cost savings,
   carbon emission reduction and provision of energy self-sufficiency. The
   proposed cooperative configuration considers that buildings with
   different load patterns exchange power through a common DC bus, so that
   an optimum utilization of the energy generated by local renewables is
   achieved. The problem of selecting the optimal capacities of
   photovoltaic arrays, energy storage systems and inverters, as well as of
   determining the optimal daily power operation plan is formulated as a
   mixed integer linear programming problem, where the objective function
   is optimized based on the Nash bargain method. The impact of the daily
   scheduling of the energy storage systems and electric vehicles, as well
   as the impact of power exchanges on the equipment sizing and vice versa
   is also highlighted. We demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness
   of the proposed cooperative system on a representative Superblock of
   Barcelona; the results indicate that the proposed approach achieves
   significant operation cost (15.7\%) and carbon emissions (12.9\% in
   average) reduction compared to the case where no power exchange occurs.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of things' data on the Web and Web linking for things'
   description and discovery is leading the way towards smart
   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The data generated in CPS represents
   observations gathered by sensor devices about the ambient environment

   Alongside this, the growing use of social networks offers near real-time
   citizen sensing capabilities as a complementary information source. The
   resulting Cyber-Physical-Social System (CPSS) can help to understand the

   manipulation, including identification of data sources, processing and
   fusion of different types and scales of data. To gain an understanding
   of the existing methods and techniques which can be useful for a
   data-oriented CPSS implementation, this paper presents a survey of the

Title = {{An Integrated Risk Index Model Based on Hierarchical Fuzzy Logic for
   Underground Risk Assessment}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},

Abstract = {{Available space in congested cities is getting scarce due to growing
   urbanization in the recent past. The utilization of underground space is
   considered as a solution to the limited space in smart cities. The
   numbers of underground facilities are growing day by day in the
   developing world. Typical underground facilities include the transit
   subway, parking lots, electric lines, water supply and sewer lines. The
   likelihood of the occurrence of accidents due to underground facilities
   is a random phenomenon. To avoid any accidental loss, a risk assessment
   method is required to conduct the continuous risk assessment and report
   any abnormality before it happens. In this paper, we have proposed a
   hierarchical fuzzy inference based model for under-ground risk
   assessment. The proposed hierarchical fuzzy inference architecture
   reduces the total number of rules from the rule base. Rule reduction is
   important because the curse of dimensionality damages the transparency
   and interpretation as it is very tough to understand and justify
   hundreds or thousands of fuzzy rules. The computation time also
   increases as rules increase. The proposed model takes 175 rules having
   eight input parameters to compute the risk index, and the conventional
   fuzzy logic requires 390,625 rules, having the same number of input
   parameters to compute risk index. Hence, the proposed model
   significantly reduces the curse of dimensionality. Rule design for fuzzy
   logic is also a tedious task. In this paper, we have also introduced new
   rule schemes, namely maximum rule-based and average rule-based; both
   schemes can be used interchangeably according to the logic needed for
   rule design. The experimental results show that the proposed method is a
   virtuous choice for risk index calculation where the numbers of
   variables are greater.}},

Abstract = {{School safety is a high priority for road safety agencies worldwide due
   to the growing concerns about student safety and emphasis on community
   livability. However, the lack of consistent data available at schools
   makes it challenging for engineers to understand the safety issues faced
   accurately. Traffic conflicts have been advocated in the literature as a
   surrogate safety measure due to the advantages it offers for road safety
   evaluations. This paper demonstrates the capability of automated traffic
   safety diagnosis at a school using computer vision techniques. The
   selected school is located in a residential area in the City of
   Edmonton, Alberta, and is on a main roadway in the neighbourhood. The
   age group of the school is from 5 to 16 years old (corresponding to
   Grade 1 to 9 respectively). Data are collected during the fall and
   winter terms. The severity and frequency of conflicts and traffic
   violations were analyzed to quantify the safety concerns. These concerns
   included driving violations, jaywalking violations as well as conflicts
   between pedestrians and vehicles as well as between vehicles and each
   other. Hourly and seasonal trends were observed and analyzed to assist
   in the selection of treatments and recommendations to improve the safety
   around schools. The results show that pedestrian safety has improved in
   winter due to lower vehicle speeds.}},

Title = {{Effects of urban land-use regulations on greenhouse gas emissions}},
Journal = {{CITIES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{135-152}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This article describes a model-based exploration of the greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions impacts of urban land use regulations. Two forms of
   regulation are considered: floor area ratio (FAR) restrictions and urban
   growth boundaries (UGBs). The model is designed so that regulation
   causes an endogenous adjustment of urban spatial structure, which in
   turn leads to changes in residential and transportation emissions. A
   novel aspect of the framework is that it captures regulation-induced
   inter-city migration. Results indicate that cities with low emission
   intensities should be cautious about adopting smart growth controls for
   climate change mitigation purposes. Even if such a regulation reduces
   per capita emissions everywhere, it can have the unintended consequence
   of increasing total emissions by pushing households to cities with
   higher emission intensities. Model variations reveal that this outcome
   is less likely if migration is costly or all urban areas are subject to
   some degree of regulation. Reducing emissions through land-use
   regulation generally carries a high abatement cost because consumers
   suffer from higher housing prices. Nevertheless, it could be an
   attractive mitigation option if policies are deployed in the right
   places, coordinated across cities, or generate substantial co-benefits
   (e.g., improved air quality, agglomeration economies, avoided
   infrastructure expansion).}},

   System environments}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{68-83}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems typically consist of a combination of mobile
   devices, embedded systems and computers to monitor, sense, and actuate
   with the surrounding real world. These computing elements are usually
   wireless, interconnected to share data and interact with each other,
   with the server part and also with cloud computing services. In such a
   heterogeneous environment, new applications arise to meet
   ever-increasing needs and these are an important challenge to the
   processing capabilities of devices. For example, automatic driving
   systems, manufacturing environments, smart city management, etc. To meet
   the requirements of said application contexts, the system can create
   computing processes to distribute the workload over the network and/or a
   cloud computing server. Multiple options arise in relation to what
   network nodes should support the execution of the processes. This paper
   focuses on this problem by introducing a distributed computational model
   to dynamically share these tasks among the computing nodes and
   considering the inherent variability of the context in these
   environments. Our novel approach promotes the integration of the
   computing resources, with externally supplied cloud services, to fulfill
   modern application requirements. A prototype implementation for the
   proposed model has been built and an application example has been
   designed to validate the proposal in a real working environment. (C)

Abstract = {{During the transition to the market economy the Central and Eastern
   European (CEE) countries were concerned with the creation of the legal
   and institutional framework for environmental preservation as an
   important component of sustainable development strategy, in line with
   the EU accession requirements. Nevertheless, without denying the efforts
   to create a real environmental culture, the economic and social problems
   like production decline and growing unemployment made public concern
   shift away to more immediately stressful issues such as real wages or
   job insecurity. Later on, in the post accession period the Cohesion
   Policy created a more stimulating framework for dealing with the
   sustainable development objectives. In the current programme period,
   2014-2020, in accordance with the ``Europe 2020{''} Strategy, the
   sustainable growth is closely related to smart and inclusive growth
   within the strategic objective of the Cohesion Policy, offering each
   member state multiple instruments and funding opportunities for
   complying with sustainability criteria. They are particularly supportive
   for CEE countries, whose internal resources are below the required
   levels in this respect. This paper proposes a spotlight on the
   sustainability issues in CEE cities, considered development vehicles for
   the regions they belong to, and thus major participants in the efforts
   to promote economic growth and diminish inter-regional disparities. An
   evolutionary perspective is applied, aiming to reveal how these cities
   responded to sustainability requirements in both pre- and post-accession
   periods. In addition, we test the variance of green performance between
   different groups of CEE cities (Baltic, Central or East European cities;
   large, medium and small cities; growing, stagnating and declining
   cities). In the final part of the paper, a special emphasis is placed on
   the policies able to create synergies between smart specialization and
   sustainable development approaches. To this end, the paper investigates
   how sustainable and smart growth policies complement each other in
   supporting eco-innovation, eco-system services and resource efficiency
   at the city level in CEE countries. Meanwhile, the paper looks for those
   smart policy mixes that rationally combine knowledge-based investments
   in areas with competitive advantages and coherent support measures for a
   greener economy, as a pre-requisite for territorial cohesion and
   competitiveness in Europe. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyses the contribution of territorial sensitive resources
   related to natural and cultural features (environmental dimension),
   innovation capabilities and specialization patterns (smart
   specialization) to regional sustainable development (spatial
   sustainability). In the context of a fast and continuous expansion of
   tourism activities, particular attention is given to their impacts. The
   results of our path model suggest that different patterns of tourism
   dynamics coexist in European regions and that, for those where this
   sector assumes larger socio-economic importance, the contribution to the
   achievement of the ``Millennium Goals{''}, as proposed by the United
   Nations, is relatively poor. Regions particularly endowed in natural
   resources reveal a weak socio-economic performance, while showing high
   levels of specialization in tourism, based on large scale and low
   value-added products and services, suggesting that new approaches to
   territorial design are required. This also leads to important spatial
   unbalances, with the most tourism -dependent European regions revealing
   relatively low levels of regional gross domestic product and high levels
   of unemployment. Despite their relatively good performance in terms of
   CO2-emissions, it seems important for those regions' sustainable
   development to increase the value added in tourism, by reinforcing the
   linkages with other relevant regional economic sectors. Information and
   communication technologies can contribute to these achievements, through
   the integration of knowledge and innovations into the products and
   services comprising the smart tourism experiences (smart development)
   and their connections with related sectors (smart specialization). (C)

Abstract = {{Besides enabling an enhanced mobile broadband, the next generation of
   mobile networks (5G) are envisioned for the support of massive
   connectivity for heterogeneous Internets of Things. These IoTs are
   envisioned for a large number of use cases including smart cities,
   environment monitoring, smart vehicles, and so on. Unfortunately, most
   IoTs have very limited computing and storage capabilities and need cloud
   services. Hence, connecting these devices through 5G systems requires
   huge spectrum resources in addition to handling massive connectivity and
   improved security. This article discusses the challenges facing the
   support of IoTs through 5G systems. The focus is devoted to discussing
   physical layer limitations in terms of spectrum resources and radio
   access channel connectivity. We show how sparsity can be exploited for
   addressing these challenges, especially in terms of enabling wideband
   spectrum management and handling the connectivity by exploiting
   device-to-device communications and edge cloud. Moreover, we identify
   major open problems and research directions that need to be explored

Abstract = {{Network slicing is a fundamental capability for future 5G networks to
   properly support current and envisioned future application scenarios.
   Network slicing facilitates a cost-effective deployment and operation of
   multiple logical networks over a common physical network infrastructure
   such that each network is customized to best serve the needs of specific
   applications (e.g., mobile broad-band, Internet of Things applications)
   and/or communications service providers (e.g., special purpose service
   providers for different sectors such as public safety, utilities, smart
   city, and automobiles). Slicing a RAN becomes particularly challenging
   due to the inherently shared nature of the radio channel and the
   potential influence that any transmitter may have on any receiver. In
   this respect, this article analyzes the RAN slicing problem in a
   multi-cell network in relation to the RRM functionalities that can be
   used as a support for splitting the radio resources among the RAN
   slices. Four different RAN slicing approaches are presented and compared
   from different perspectives, such as the granularity in the assignment

Abstract = {{Analyzing public movement in transportation networks in a city is
   significant in understanding the life of citizen and making improved
   city plans for the future. This study focuses on investigating the flow
   orientation of major activity regions based on smart card transit data.
   The flow orientation based on the real movements such as transit data
   can provide the easiest way of understanding public movement in the
   complicated transportation networks. First, high inflow regions (HIRs)
   are identified from transit data for morning and evening peak hours. The
   morning and evening HIRs are used to represent major activity regions
   for major daytime activities and residential areas, respectively.
   Second, the directional orientation of flow is then derived through the
   directional inflow vectors of the HIRs to show the bias in directional
   orientation and compare flow orientation among major activity regions.
   Finally, clustering analysis for HIRs is applied to capture the main
   patterns of flow orientations in the city and visualize the patterns on
   the map. The proposed methodology was illustrated with smart card
   transit data of bus and subway transportation networks in Seoul, Korea.
   Some remarkable patterns in the distribution of movements and
   orientations were found inside the city. The proposed methodology is
   useful since it unfolds the complexity and makes it easy to understand
   the main movement patterns in terms of flow orientation.}},

Abstract = {{Smart city improves quality of life for urban residents by using
   multiple information and communication technologies. As the network
   infrastructure of smart city, GLObal MObility NETwork (GLOMONET) can
   offer seamless network connection service for mobile subscribers.
   Whereas, because of the opening characteristics of wireless channel and
   various attacks, security becomes a vital issue in GLOMONET. Recently,
   Karuppiah and Saravanan proposed an enhanced user authentication for
   roaming service in GLOMONET. Unfortunately, their scheme lacks the
   features of session key update and perfect forward secrecy, and the
   session key can be revealed by home agent. Besides, their scheme faces
   clock synchronization problem and efficiency problem. In order to
   provide secure authentication service, a novel ECC (elliptic curve
   cryptosystem)based user authentication scheme for roaming service in
   smart city is proposed in this manuscript. The security features of the
   proposed scheme are formally evaluated by using provable security method
   under random oracle model and also present informal analysis. In
   addition, comparative analysis is given among our scheme and relevant
   protocols. The results of comparative analysis illustrate that the
   proposed protocol provides robust and efficient for roaming service in
   smart city.}},

Abstract = {{In smart city construction, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are normally
   deployed to collect and transmit real-time data. The nodes of the WSN
   are embedded facility that integrated sensors and data processing
   modules. For security and privacy concerns, cryptography methods are
   required for data protection. However, the RivestShamir-Adleman (RSA)
   cryptosystem, known as the the most popular and deployed public key
   algorithm, is still hardly implemented on embedded devices because of
   the intense computation required from its inherent arithmetic
   operations. Even though, different methods have being proposed for more
   efficient RSA implementations such as utilizing the Chinese remainder
   theorem, various modular exponentiation methods, and optimized modular
   arithmetic methods. In this paper, we propose an efficient
   multiplication for long integers on the sensor nodes equipped with
   16-bit microcontrollers. Combined with this efficient multiplication, we
   obtain a faster Montgomery multiplication. The combined optimized
   Montgomery multiplication, the Chinese remainder theorem, and the m-ary
   exponentiation method allowed for execution times of less than 44.6 x
   10(6) clock cycles for RSA decryption, a new speed record for the RSA
   implementation on MSP430 microcontrollers.}},

Abstract = {{As a more ubiquitous concept, smart health (shealth) is the
   context-aware complement of mobile health within smart cities, and it
   has made an increasing number of people turn to cloud-based services. In
   a practical s-health system, security and privacy issues are of great
   importance and have to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a secure
   s-health system which realizes fine-grained access control on s-health
   cloud data and hence ensures users' privacy protection. The key
   technique is a promising cryptographic primitive called
   ciphertext-policy attributebased encryption. In order to trace malicious
   behaviors in the proposed s-health system, two kinds of key abuse
   problems are considered: malicious key sharing among colluding users and
   key escrow problem of the semi-trusted authority. In the proposed
   s-health system, any malicious behavior of a user including illegal key
   sharing can be traced. For the semi-trusted authority, it can be
   accountable for its misbehavior including illegal key re-distribution.
   Particularly, the proposed system supports large universe and attributes
   do not need to be pre-specified during the system initialization phase.
   Besides, our system is proven fully secure in the random oracle model
   and it allows any monotonic access policies. Theoretical analysis and
   experimental results indicate that the proposed s-health system is
   suitable for smart city environment.}},

Abstract = {{As healthcare is one of major socioeconomic problems in cities, mobile
   healthcare network becomes one of core components of smart cities, which
   would improve urban healthcare environment. However, there are wide
   privacy concerns as personal health information is outsourced to
   untrusted cloud servers. It is a promising method to encrypt the health
   data before outsourcing, but how to do diagnosis computations on the
   encrypted health data remains an important challenge. In this paper, we
   propose a general architecture of the mobile healthcare network, and
   define three typical secure medical computations, which include the
   average heart rate, the long QT syndrome detection, and the chi-square
   tests. To achieve computations on the ciphertext, we leverage fully
   homomorphic encryption (FHE) to encrypt the health data. Different from
   previous related works, we use more efficient Dowlin's FHE scheme to
   implement above three medical computations. In our implementation of the
   average heart rate, only one ciphertext is sent back to the receiver, so
   homomorphic decryption is needed once. We take an efficient l-bits
   comparator to implement the long QT syndrome detection, which only needs
   l XOR operations and one homomorphic multiplication. We first implement
   the chisquare tests by homomorphic additions and homomorphic
   multiplications, which can be used to study whether varicose veins is
   relevant to overweight. Extensive simulations and analytical results
   show the scalability and efficiency of our proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{A smart city can utilize information and communication technologies to
   minimize energy, waste, and resource consumption and attain
   high-efficiency services, so it directly improves the life quality of
   all residents. However, it also brings about some security and privacy
   challenges. For instance, once the ubiquitous network in the smart city
   is attacked, all of the sensitive information and residents' identities
   will be revealed. In many application scenarios, the anonymity of
   residents is a desirable security property. After all, nobody wants to
   be traced for his daily activity or personal habits. In this paper, we
   propose a generic identity-based broadcast encryption scheme which can
   satisfy information's confidentiality and users' anonymity
   simultaneously under chosen-ciphertext attacks. What is different from
   our previous work which was published in ACISP 2016 is that we present
   the proof of confidentiality and focus on the application environment.
   The generic IBBE construction has a desirable property that its public
   parameter size and private key size are constant as well as its
   decryption cost is independent of the number of receivers. Thus, no
   matter from which point of views, the construction is very appropriate
   for smart city information system.}},

Abstract = {{One of the interesting secure applications in the smart city is
   broadcasting information to legitimate users, desirably with user
   privacy. Broadcast encryption has been considered as a useful tool to
   protect the data security and provide data access control. Most works in
   broadcast encryption are about the data security, while less attention
   is paid to the data access control and the identity privacy. In this
   paper, based on broadcast encryption, we present a scheme called Fully
   Privacy-Preserving and Revocable Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption,
   which preserves the data privacy and the identity privacy of the
   receiver as well as the revoked user. The data can be securely protected
   and only the authorized user can access the data. The revocation process
   does not reveal any information about the data contents and the receiver
   identity. The public learns nothing about the receiver identity and the
   revoked user identity. These properties lead to nice applications in the
   smart city where identity privacy is desirable. The security of our
   scheme is proved to be semantically secure in the random oracle model.}},

Abstract = {{Smart cities involve the provision of advanced services for road traffic
   users. Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a promising communication
   technology in this regard. Preservation of privacy is crucial in these
   services to foster their acceptance. Previous approaches have mainly
   focused on PKI-based or ID-based cryptography. However, these works have
   not fully addressed the minimum information disclosure principle. Thus,
   questions such as how to prove that a driver is a neighbour of a given
   zone, without actually disclosing his identity or real address, remain
   unaddressed. A set of techniques, referred to as Attribute-Based
   Credentials (ABCs), have been proposed to address this need in
   traditional computation scenarios. In this paper, we explore the use of
   ABCs in the vehicular context. For this purpose, we focus on a set of
   use cases from European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
   Basic Set of Applications, specially appropriate for the early
   development of smart cities. We assess which ABC techniques are suitable
   for this scenario, focusing on three representative ones-Idemix, U-Prove
   and VANETupdated Persiano systems. Our experimental results show that
   they are feasible in VANETs considering state-of-theart technologies,
   and that Idemix is the most promising technique for most of the
   considered use cases.}},

Abstract = {{Smart city has been greatly promoted by the adoption of information and
   communication technology. At the same time, data integrity becomes an
   urgent necessity in cloud storage scenario. When smart city meets cloud,
   if the data are damaged or corrupted, it will be a serious security
   loophole of smart city. Recently, numerous remote data auditing (RDA)
   protocols have been presented, among which Sookhak et al. put forward a
   dynamic remote data auditing protocol to deal with this major concern.
   In this paper, we found that this protocol has inherent security flaws,
   thus fails to achieve its original goal. Specifically, this protocol is
   vulnerable to two types of attacks, namely replace attack and replay
   attack. We show the details that how a malicious server can deceive data
   owners to believe that the data are maintained well by launching such
   attacks. Then, we describe an improved RDA protocol with provable
   security by utilizing algebraic signature to fix those security flaws.
   We employ the rank-based Merkle Hash Tree to achieve verifiable dynamic
   data operations for our RDA protocol. We also provide detailed security
   proof of the proposed RDA protocol.}},

Abstract = {{People are experiencing an evolution of smart cities. Building a smart
   city will enhance economic competitiveness, social cohesion, and quality
   of life of its citizens. But smart cities accumulate and process large
   amount of files, which raises security and privacy concerns at
   individual and community levels. In the case of file sharing in smart
   cities, security should be considered to embrace file confidentiality,
   file integrity, receiver privacy, and sender privacy. In this paper, we
   propose a privacy-preserving identity-based file sharing (PIFS) scheme
   to meet these security goals. In PIFS, identity managers for receivers
   and senders designate them secret keys associated with their identities,
   respectively. Receivers and senders can register their identities to the
   group managers without leaking their secret keys. Then a sender can
   share confidential files with a peer, leaking neither identity of them.
   However, in case of dispute, the receiver group manager and sender open
   authority can trace the receiver and the sender, respectively. The
   security properties of our scheme are formally proven. Analysis shows
   that our scheme is efficient and practical.}},

Abstract = {{Security and privacy for smart cities have attached much attention. As
   cloud computing can provide secure and reliable data storage and data
   sharing, it has become an important infrastructure for smart cities.
   However, in the cloud storage system, the cloud server cannot be fully
   trusted. Therefore, new solutions of access control of cloud data need
   to be proposed. In this paper, we construct a proxy-assisted access
   control scheme. We use the method of ciphertext policy attribute-based
   encryption (CP-ABE) to realize access control of cloud data for smart
   cities. Since major computation of decryption is outsourced to the cloud
   server, our scheme can achieve efficient user decryption. We also
   present an efficient user and attribute revocation method for our scheme
   which achieves both forward security and backward security. Finally, we
   give secure and performance analysis of our scheme, which show that our
   scheme is secure and highly efficient.}},

Abstract = {{In the smart city construction, massive data collected from various
   fields need to be outsourced to the cloud for convenience and resource
   saving. However, integrity and confidentiality of the data in cloud
   remains a challenge issue due to the loss of data possession. As a
   solution, some public data auditing schemes have been proposed in last
   several years. Most recently, Li et al. proposed an efficient public
   auditing scheme and claimed that it could reduce the cost of clients on
   generating verification metadata. In this paper, we analyze the security
   of Li et al.'s scheme and point out two weaknesses in it. We demonstrate
   that it cannot achieve the confidentiality for outsourced data and it is
   vulnerable to the proof forgery attack. To address these weaknesses, we
   propose an improved public auditing scheme, which can not only preserve
   the data privacy but also resist the proof forgery attack. Security
   analysis shows that our scheme is provably secure in a robust security
   model. Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme can overcome
   the weaknesses in Li et al.'s scheme at the cost of increasing
   computation overhead slightly.}},

Title = {{A communication efficient distributed learning framework for smart
   environments}},
Journal = {{PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{46-68}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Due to the pervasive diffusion of personal mobile and IoT devices, many
   ``smart environments'' (e.g., smart cities and smart factories) will be,
   among others, generators of huge amounts of data. To provide value-add
   services in these environments, data will have to be analysed to extract
   knowledge. Currently, this is typically achieved through centralised
   cloud-based data analytics services. However, according to many studies,
   this approach may present significant issues from the standpoint of data
   ownership, and even wireless network capacity. One possibility to cope
   with these shortcomings is to move data analytics closer to where data
   is generated. In this paper we tackle this issue by proposing and
   analysing a distributed learning framework, whereby data analytics are
   performed at the edge of the network, i.e., on locations very close to
   where data is generated. Specifically, in our framework, partial data
   analytics are performed directly on the nodes that generate the data, or
   on nodes close by (e.g., some of the data generators can take this role
   on behalf of subsets of other nodes nearby). Then, nodes exchange
   partial models and refine them accordingly. Our framework is general
   enough to host different analytics services. In the specific case
   analysed in the paper we focus on a learning task, considering two
   distributed learning algorithms. Using an activity recognition and a
   pattern recognition task, both on reference datasets, we compare the two
   learning algorithms between each other and with a central cloud solution
   (i.e., one that has access to the complete datasets). Our results show
   that using distributed machine learning techniques, it is possible to
   drastically reduce the network overhead, while obtaining performance
   comparable to the cloud solution in terms of learning accuracy. The
   analysis also shows when each distributed learning approach is
   preferable, based on the specific distribution of the data on the nodes.

Title = {{Zero knowledge based client side deduplication for encrypted files of
   secure cloud storage in smart cities}},
Journal = {{PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{41}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{As typical applications in the field of the cloud computing, cloud
   storage services are popular in the development of smart cities for
   their low costs and huge storage capacity. Proofs-of-ownership (PoW) is
   an important cryptographic primitive in cloud storage to ensure that a
   client holds the whole file rather than part of it in secure client side
   data deduplication. The previous PoW schemes worked well when the file
   is in plaintext. However, the privacy of the clients' data may be
   vulnerable to honest-but-curious attacks. To deal with this issue, the
   clients tend to encrypt files before outsourcing them to the cloud,
   which makes the existing PoW schemes inapplicable any more. In this
   paper, we first propose a secure zero-knowledge based client side
   deduplication scheme over encrypted files. We prove that the proposed
   scheme is sound, complete and zero-knowledge. The scheme can achieve a
   high detection probability of the clients' misbehavior. Then we
   introduced a proxy re-encryption based key distribution scheme. This
   scheme ensures that the server knows nothing about the encryption key
   even though it acts as a proxy to help distributing the file encryption
   key. It also enables the clients who have gained the ownership of a file
   to share the file with the encryption key generated without establishing
   secure channels among them. It is proved that the clients' private key
   cannot be recovered by the server or clients collusion attacks during
   the key distribution phase. Our performance evaluation shows that the
   proposed scheme is much more efficient than the existing client side
   deduplication schemes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues the role of the University in the Smart City
   transformation strategy. The theoretical structure takes as reference
   the recent Complexity theory for city development and their application
   to the networks of the Connected city. The approach is based on a

   a deductive and interpretivist method interviewing 19 senior experts
   whole profiles represent the different forces of the Triple Helix model.
   Our results show the Barcelona city hall has the objective to implement
   five main innovative services which are fuelled by six main emerging
   technologies. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the universities
   curriculum is not aligned with the city hall's objectives and a gap
   exists to prepare the undergraduates to the professions required for the
   Smart City. We recommend six propositions to reshape the University
   program curricula and leverage the application of Complexity theory to
   network. The originality of this study is to propose a 3-phases method

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Street view (panoramic view) services have begun to shift from PC
   platforms to mobile smart devices. Considering the capabilities of smart
   terminal devices, a 360 degrees spherical level of detail (LoD) model
   for mobile street view services that renders panoramic images on the
   inner surface of a sphere via LoD is proposed in this article. Panoramic
   images are segmented into tiles and organized in a pyramid tile
   structure for LoD rendering to improve the rendering efficiency of the
   proposed model. A projection model between panoramic images and the
   spherical surface is presented to map the panoramic tiles on the
   spherical graticule. A street view-rendering algorithm of panoramic
   images is proposed with the rendering function of OpenGL for Embedded
   Systems (OpenGL ES). A street view service app running on Android, based
   on the proposed approach, is implemented to assess two aspects of the
   panoramic view model, namely visualization effect and efficiency.
   Experiment results reveal that the 360 degrees spherical LoD model of
   the panoramic image can display 3D street view scenes better than the
   cubic panoramic view model. The proposed model also has an excellent 3D
   visualization effect and high-efficiency rendering ability for mobile
   street view services. Therefore, it is applicable in large-scale mobile
   street view services both online and offline and in augmented reality

Abstract = {{Modern cities and their architectural structures undergo significant
   functional and physical changes. In recent years, the interventions on
   building envelopes have increased. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse
   potential remodeling of glass facades, along with applying the concept
   of smart technologies, in order to increase energy efficiency of the
   existing buildings. This paper analyses the modernization process of
   devastated glass fagade of the tall Slavija hotel, built in 1960s in
   Belgrade, Serbia, taking into consideration some positive examples of
   transformation and reskinning of buildings, where the aspect of
   medialization is an active part of urban renewal. The subject of this
   paper is the analysis of research findings about the improved thermal
   comfort of this building, after performing the replacement of its glass
   fagade and converting the hotel building into an office building.
   Special attention was paid to the implementation of media technologies
   and final effects on energy balance of the newly designed facade.
   The proposed solution is supposed to evaluate the improved thermal
   comfort that was achieved by a radical renovation of the facade and by
   replacing the existing facade with a new single facade (double and
   triple glazed units), with media elements as well as without them. The
   research results are presented as proposals for improving EE public
   buildings by implementing the latest system of curtain walls in order to
   increase the value of the buildings. One of the most important criteria
   included in the process of energy refurbishment is technological
   improvement of the existing buildings, along with the presentation of
   media facades. The case study is based on EnergyPlus simulations. (C)

Abstract = {{The global warming threats, the presence of policies on support of
   renewable energies, and the desire for clean smart cities are the major
   drives for most recent researches on developing small wind turbines in
   urban environments. VAWTs (vertical axis wind turbines) are most
   appealing for energy harvesting in the urban environment. This is
   attributed due to structural simplicity, wind direction independency, no
   yaw mechanism required, withstand high turbulence winds, cost
   effectiveness, easier maintenance, and lower noise emission of VAWTs.
   This paper reviews recent published works on CFD (computational fluid
   dynamic) simulations of Darrieus VAWTs. Recommendations and guidelines
   are presented for turbulence modeling, spatial and temporal
   discretization, numerical schemes and algorithms, and computational
   domain size. The operating and geometrical parameters such as tip speed
   ratio, wind speed, solidity, blade number and blade shapes are fully
   investigated. The purpose is to address different progresses in
   simulations areas such as blade profile modification and optimization,
   wind turbine performance augmentation using guide vanes, wind turbine
   wake interaction in wind farms, wind turbine aerodynamic noise
   reduction, dynamic stall control, self-starting characteristics, and
   effects of unsteady and skewed wind conditions. (C) Published by

Abstract = {{Low-powered devices are ubiquitous in this modern age especially their
   application in the urban and built environment. The myriad of low-energy

   the future of smart cities providing power for extended operation with

   integrated with aero-elastic belts (electromagnetic transduction type)
   was presented. The simulation used a gable-roof type building model with
   a 27 degrees pitch obtained from the literature. The atmospheric
   boundary layer flow was employed for the simulation of the incident
   wind. The work investigates the effect of various wind speeds and
   aeroelastic belt locations on the performance of the device giving
   insight on the potential for integration of the harvester into the built
   environment.
   The apex of the roof of the building yielded the highest power output
   for the aero-elastic belt due to flow speed-up maximisation in this
   region. This location produced the largest power output under the 45
   angle of approach, generating an estimated 62.4 mW of power under
   accelerated wind in belt position of up to 6.2 m/s. For wind velocity of
   10 m/s, wind in this position accelerated up to approximately 14.4 m/s
   which is a 37.5\% speed-up at the particular height. This occurred for
   an oncoming wind 30 relative to the building facade. For velocity equal
   to 4.7 m/s under 0 wind direction, airflows in facade edges were the
   fastest at 5.4 m/s indicating a 15\% speed-up along the edges of the
   building. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, with more than 50 \% of the world's population living in urban
   areas, cities are facing important environmental challenges. Among them,
   air pollution has emerged as one of the most important concerns, taking
   into account the social costs related to the effect of polluted air.
   According to a report of the World Health Organization, approximately
   seven million people die each year from the effects of air pollution.
   Despite this fact, the same report suggests that cities could greatly
   improve their air quality through local measures by exploiting modern
   and efficient solutions for smart infrastructures. Ideally, this
   approach requires insights of how pollutant levels change over time in
   specific locations. To tackle this problem, we present an evolutionary
   system for the prediction of pollutants levels based on a recently
   proposed variant of genetic programming. This system is designed to
   predict the amount of ozone level, based on the concentration of other
   pollutants collected by sensors disposed in critical areas of a city. An
   analysis of data related to the region of Yuen Long (one of the most
   polluted areas of China), shows the suitability of the proposed system
   for addressing the problem at hand. In particular, the system is able to
   predict the ozone level with greater accuracy with respect to other
   techniques that are commonly used to tackle similar forecasting
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{Wi-Fi Direct has become vastly popular in the last few years. Due to its
   fast network setup and the provision of high transmission rates, it is
   expected to be the piggyback technology for high speed device-to-device
   communications in smart cities. The increasing demand on Wi-Fi Direct
   networks and its co-location in the same band with other Wi-Fi ad-hoc
   and infrastructure networks have entailed the need for developing new
   adaptive techniques to utilize the wireless spectrum efficiently. In
   this paper, we introduce, analyze and implement a self-organizing
   algorithm designed specifically for pop-up Wi-Fi Direct networks. The
   algorithm dynamically changes the operating channels of pop-up Wi-Fi
   Direct networks according to their performance in a non-cooperative
   manner. It utilizes the spectrum efficiently, reduces congestion and
   enhances performance. Moreover, the modified Wi-Fi Direct network
   running the proposed algorithm is interoperable with all other Wi-Fi
   network modes and setups and does not affect their functionalities. On
   the contrary, it enhances their performance implicitly. We implement the
   algorithm using the driver of RTL8188CUS chipset in a Linux environment
   and conduct experiments to evaluate its performance. The obtained
   results illustrate the benefits of using the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper gives a detailed description of the ETEM-SG model, which
   provides a simulation of the long -term development of a regional

   sources connected at the transmission network like, e.g., wind farms, or
   the distribution networks like, e.g., roof top PV panels). The model
   takes into account the options to optimize the power system provided by
   grid-friendly flexible loads and distributed energy resources, including
   variable speed drive powered CHP micro-generators, heat pumps, and
   electric vehicles. One deals with uncertainties in some parameters by
   implementing robust optimization techniques. A case study, based on the

Abstract = {{The human mobility patterns have drew much attention from researchers
   for decades, considering about its importance for urban planning and
   traffic management. In this study, the taxi GPS trajectories, smart card
   transaction data of subway and bus from Beijing are utilized to model
   human mobility in space. The original datasets are cleaned and processed
   to attain the displacement of each trip according to the origin and
   destination locations. Then, the Akaike information criterion is adopted
   to screen out the best fitting distribution for each mode from candidate
   ones. The results indicate that displacements of taxi trips follow the
   exponential distribution. Besides, the exponential distribution also
   fits displacements of bus trips well. However, their exponents are
   significantly different. Displacements of subway trips show great
   specialties and can be well fitted by the gamma distribution. It is
   obvious that human mobility of each mode is different. To explore the
   overall human mobility, the three datasets are mixed up to form a fusion
   dataset according to the annual ridership proportions. Finally, the
   fusion displacements follow the power-law distribution with an
   exponential cutoff. It is innovative to combine different transportation
   modes to model human mobility in the city. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The main technical issues regarding smart city solutions are related to
   data gathering, aggregation, reasoning, data analytics, access, and
   service delivering via Smart City APIs (Application Program Interfaces).
   Different kinds of Smart City APIs enable smart city services and
   applications, while their effectiveness depends on the architectural
   solutions to pass from data to services for city users and operators,
   exploiting data analytics, and presenting services via APIs.
   Therefore, there is a strong activity on defining smart city
   architectures to cope with this complexity, putting in place a
   significant range of different kinds of services and processes. In this
   paper, the work performed in the context of Sii-Mobility smart city
   project on defining a smart city architecture addressing a wide range of
   processes and data is presented. To this end, comparisons of the state
   of the art solutions of smart city architectures for data aggregation
   and for Smart City API are presented by putting in evidence the usage
   semantic ontologies and knowledge base in the data aggregation in the
   production of smart services. The solution proposed aggregate and
   re-conciliate data (open and private, static and real time) by using
   reasoning/smart algorithms for enabling sophisticated service delivering
   via Smart City API. The work presented has been developed in the context
   of the Sii-Mobility national smart city project on mobility and
   transport integrated with smart city services with the aim of reaching a
   more sustainable mobility and transport systems. Sii-Mobility is
   grounded on Km4City ontology and tools for smart city data aggregation,
   analytics support and service production exploiting smart city API. To
   this end, Sii-Mobility/Km4City APIs have been compared to the state of
   the art solutions. Moreover, the proposed architecture has been assessed
   in terms of performance, computational and network costs in terms of
   measures that can be easily performed on private cloud on premise. The
   computational costs and workloads of the data ingestion and data
   analytics processes have been assessed to identify suitable measures to
   estimate needed resources. Finally, the API consumption related data in
   the recent period are presented. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Temperature levels play a key role in the thermal energy demand of urban
   contexts affecting their associated primary energy consumption and
   Renewable Energy Fraction. A Smart Heating strategy accounts for those
   supply features requiring new solutions to be effectively renewable and
   to solve the RES capacity firming. Power-to-Gas (P2G) is the way to
   decarbonize the energy supply chain as fraction of Hybrid fuels,
   combination of fossil ones and Renewable Hydrogen, as immediate
   responsive storage solution. While, Power-To-Heat is conceived as the
   strategy to modernize the high and medium temperature heating systems by
   electricity-driven machines to switch from Fuel-to-Heat to
   Electricity-to-Heat solutions. The authors investigated on different
   urban energy scenarios at RES share increase from 25\% up to 50\% in the
   energy mix to highlight strengths and weaknesses of the P2G
   applications. Primary Energy Consumption was chosen as the objective
   function. Three Reference Cities were chosen as reference scenarios.
   Moreover, the analytical models of P2G was designed and implemented in
   the reference energy system. The results of the twelve scenarios, four
   for each Reference City were evaluated in terms of amount of Renewable
   Heat delivered. Finally, the interaction between P2G and renewable heat
   production was evaluated. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Abstract = {{Due to the lack of solar radiation measurement stations, prediction of
   solar radiation had a great interest in the recent years. In the present
   work, fourteen solar radiation models had been used to assess monthly
   mean global solar radiation on a horizontal surface. Since we observed
   that each model was adequate for some months of the year, one model
   can't be sufficient for the prediction of the whole year, that is why we
   proposed a smart hybrid system, based on intelligent rules, which could
   select the most suitable prediction model from the fourteen models
   listed herein. In order to test and evaluate the proposed models, the
   southern Algerian city; Tamanrasset was selected for this study. Five
   years (2000-2004) of meteorological data sets were collected from the
   Algerian National Office of Meteorology (NOM), and from the two spatial
   databases. Thus, the reached results indicated that the new hybrid model
   could be able to predict global solar radiation with an excellent
   accuracy in this location. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As an open integrated environment deployed with wired and wireless
   infrastructures, the smart city heavily relies on the wireless-optical
   broadband access network. Smart home data are usually sent to neighbor
   optical network units (ONUs) through front-end wireless mesh networks
   (WMNs) and finally reach the optical line terminal (OLT) for decision
   making via the passive optical network (PON) backhaul. To reduce
   backhaul bandwidth saturated by this conventional approach, smart edge
   devices (EDs) should be deployed at sensors and ONUs so that
   collaborative edge computing can be performed in front-end WMNs.
   Moreover, the cooperation of EDs at different ONUs is also promising for
   computing tasks that cannot be handled within front-end WMNs due to the
   local bottleneck, leading to collaborative edge computing in the PON
   backhaul. In this paper, network virtualization is utilized to support
   the coordination of computing and network resources. We also describe
   the relationship between virtual networks and requirements of computing
   tasks for substrate resources. First, a graph-cutting algorithm is
   employed to embed as many virtual networks as possible onto the common
   network infrastructure in front-end WMNs, aiming at minimizing the total
   transmitting power. Next, we transform impossibly embedded virtual
   networks into new ones that must be processed through the PON backhaul
   where the wavelength consumption will be optimized. Simulations results
   demonstrate that 1) the total transmitting power assigned for nodes is
   effectively reduced using the graph-cutting algorithm if all computing
   tasks can be solved by front-end WMNs; 2) otherwise, our method accepts
   more virtual networks with the improvement ratio of 77\%, through the
   PON backhaul. In addition, there is a good match between the algorithm
   result and the optimal number of consumed wavelengths per optical fiber
   cable.}},

Abstract = {{Smart LED streetlight system is one of the enabling technologies for a
   smart city, giving low-cost, low power outdoor lighting also with
   benefits for vehicle users as well as pedestrians. Integration of
   sensors and ZigBee-based wireless sensor modules can furnish an optimal
   platform for an innovative LED streetlight application. Psychological
   studies suggest that a different level of color temperature can
   significantly affect human circadian rhythm. For this reason, correlated
   color temperature (CCT)-based illumination gives a significant lighting
   performance both in terms of energy efficiency and in overcoming traffic
   accidents in low visibility areas. Previous works usually assume only
   specific platform and did not consider CCT-based illumination toward
   smart LED streetlight system. In this paper, we consider the importance
   of CCT-based illumination and propose a novel integration of public
   weather data awareness, ZigBee-based wireless communication, and dynamic
   web-based management system for the state-of-art of smart LED
   streetlight system applicable to smart city. In particular, we design a
   central web server that can receive weather information and real-time
   sensor data from each LED streetlights and provides a dynamic and
   flexible web interface for authorized users. Furthermore, real-time
   implementation of the proposed system shows perfect
   transmission-reception parameters, such as throughput and signal
   strength among the different LED streetlights, which fulfills the
   wireless communication range and signal quality between each LED
   streetlights.}},

   early warning information}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{134-147}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{An innovative technique for seismic retrofit of a case study highway
   bridge is presented herein. It is done by means of the friction pendulum
   isolators (FPS) combined with smart magnetorheological dampers (MR), the
   latter calibrated through the use of a Seismic Early Warning System
   (SEWS). Hybrid systems, widely investigated by researchers in last
   years, generally represent a suitable solution in case of base isolated
   bridges. As a matter of facts, the introduction of an isolation system
   allows to reduce shear and bending moment in piers, but may increase
   decks' relative displacements. A possible effective strategy for
   limiting this undesired effect may be the adoption of a dissipative
   system. Herein the passive smart use of MR devices is proposed. The MR
   dampers are smart in the sense that their mechanical properties can be
   tuned almost in real time, once before the earthquake strikes the site.
   A properly designed control algorithm modifies dampers' characteristics
   according to the intensity of the seismic event is going to occur, as
   forecasted by the SEWS. This retrofit strategy makes the structure
   someway adaptive, leading to a significant enhancement of the seismic
   performance against earthquakes even very different one each other. The
   case study is an existing reinforced concrete highway bridge built in
   the 70's; located in the city of Naples, southern Italy. (C) 2017

   relaying networks with wireless power transfer-aware channel}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{In terms of modern applications of wireless sensor networks in smart
   cities, relay terminals can be employed to simultaneously deliver both
   information and energy to a designated receiver by harvesting power via
   radio frequency (RF). In this paper, we propose time switching aware
   channel (TSAC) protocol and consider a dual-hop full-duplex (FD)
   relaying system, where the energy constrained relay node is powered by
   RF signals from the source using decode-and-forward (DF) relaying
   protocols. In order to evaluate system performance, we provide an
   analytical expression of the achievable throughput of two different
   communication modes, including instantaneous transmission and
   delay-constrained transmission. In addition, the optimal harvested power
   allocation policies are studied for these transmission modes. Most
   importantly, we propose a novel energy harvesting (EH) policy based on
   FD relaying which can substantially boost the systemthroughput compared
   to the conventional half-duplex (HD) relaying architecture in other
   transmission modes. Numerical results illustrate that our proposed
   protocol outperforms the conventional protocol under the optimal
   received power for energy harvesting at relay. Our numerical findings
   verify the correctness of our derivations and also prove the importance
   of FD transmission mode.}},

Abstract = {{Although vast amounts of data have been opened by several levels of
   government around the world and high hopes continue to be expressed with
   respect to open data's potential for innovation, whether open government
   data (OGD) will live up to expectations is still questioned. Up to now,
   the OGD literature has focused mostly on the technical side of open
   data, with little focus on network aspects. We argue that a definition
   of what an OGD platform is, and what is within its scope, is lacking. In
   this exploratory article, we use three knowledge epistemologies -
   cognitivist, connectionist, and autopoietic - as a lens to examine OGD
   platforms and to define three different platform types. To validate and
   further enrich the platform types and to identify which types are most
   prevalent in case study research and which are underrepresented, we
   performed a literature review of case studies on OGD platforms published
   in the main e-government outlets between 2009 and 2016. Looking for
   elements of each OGD platform type in the case study literature resulted
   in a pressing question for more empirical research focusing on the
   network aspects of OGD platforms. We also highlighted the
   underrepresentation of the autopoietic OGD platform type in case study
   research. We conclude this article by providing a research agenda for
   OGD platforms.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of information and communication technology (ICT)
   applications for the development of innovative, sustainable, and smart
   cities has become a new model for municipal cooperation between
   government and corporations. Smart cities contribute to social stability
   and economic prosperity by encouraging and enabling corporations to
   invest their resources and expertise in the cities, and by providing
   more prosperity and contentment for their citizens. Smart city services
   provide citizens with an improved living environment and increase their
   overall quality of life. Since the citizens are the users of the
   services, it is vitally important that their ideas and perspectives are
   taken into account during the planning and management of such services.
   This study surveyed citizens in Taiwanese cities that had all
   participated in the Intelligent Community Forum smart city campaigns at
   least once. The findings reveal that citizens are willing to accept and
   use ICT-based smart city services if the services are designed with
   innovative concepts that secure their privacy and offer a high quality
   of services. The more they use the services, the higher the quality of
   life achieved. The only factor that does not influence citizens'
   acceptance and usage of ICT-based smart city services is their city
   engagement. The study contributes to the academic literature and also
   provides practical pointers for cities and technology suppliers
   embarking on smart city initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{Buildings are the largest contributors to households' energy footprints.
   If both the energy for household mobility and the embodied energy are
   added to the energy for heating/cooling, domestic hot water, lighting,
   buildings are by far the main problem of energy consumption in France.
   This paper presents a review of the evolution of the main drivers of
   CO(2)emissions by buildings in France. Eventually, the paradox of the
   effect of density is discussed. Lower density of cities increases the
   energy spent per inhabitant, in particular for transport, but may also
   increase the production of low-carbon renewable energies, shifting the
   global energy balance and influencing the prospective studies of future,
   energy efficient, smart cities. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{The concepts of ``Smart Cities{''} and ``Smart Manufacturing{''} are
   different data-driven domains, although both rely on intelligent
   information technology and data analysis. With the application of linked
   data and affordance-based approaches, both domains converge, paving the
   way for new and innovative viewpoints regarding the comparison of urban
   tasks with indoor manufacturing tasks. The present study builds on the
   work, who state that cities are scaled versions of each other, by
   extending this thesis towards indoor manufacturing environments. Based
   on their structure and complexity, these environments are considered to
   form ecosystems of their own, comparable to ``small cities{''}. This
   conceptual idea is demonstrated by examining the process of human
   problem-solving in transportation situations from both perspectives
   (i.e., city-level and manufacturing-level). In particular, the authors
   model tasks of human operators that are used to support transportation
   processes in indoor manufacturing environments based on affordances and
   spatial-temporal data. This paper introduces the fundamentals of the
   transformation process of outdoor tasks and process planning activities
   to indoor environments, particularly to semiconductor manufacturing
   environments. The idea is to examine the mapping of outdoor tasks and
   applications to indoor environments, and vice-versa, based on an example
   focusing on the autonomous transportation of production assets in a
   manufacturing environment. The approach is based on a spatial graph
   database, populated with an indoor navigation ontology and instances of
   indoor and outdoor objects. The results indicate that human
   problem-solving strategies can be applied to indoor manufacturing
   environments to support decision-making in autonomous transportation
   tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Although there are many initiatives to create incentives for investors
   and developers to invest in and redevelop brownfield sites, efficient
   prioritization of brownfields by taking into account environmental,
   economic, and social constraints remains a challenge. This study
   introduces a method to screen numerous brownfields over large geographic
   areas by using geographic information systems (GIS) and to assess and
   prioritize such sites for green building suitability based on leadership
   in energy and environmental design (LEED) criteria. A case study was
   completed for the greater Bridgeport, Connecticut region. With 279
   brownfield sites, the city has among the highest number of brownfields
   in the state. Variables chosen to determine suitability and
   prioritization were based on LEED version 4 for New Construction and
   Major Renovation. Chosen variables input into GIS make up 13 points on
   the LEED checklist. The developed method proved to be efficient for
   analyzing large numbers of brownfields, making it a viable option for
   governments and developers alike to make informed decisions for
   brownfield redevelopment. The study demonstrates that GIS can be used to
   streamline prioritization of brownfield sites, while at the same time
   guiding site selection for green buildings. (C) 2017 American Society of

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impacts of two different urban development
   strategies (infill and suburban new town development) on changes in the
   land surface temperature (LST) in the Seoul metropolitan area. One
   large-scale infill site and three suburban new towns developed between

   retrieved LSTs and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from
   remote sensing images for both of the years, and combined them with
   parcel-based land use information. The descriptive and statistical
   results showed a substantial LST reduction at the infill site, whereas
   the LST rose in the suburban new towns. In particular, the improved NDVI
   in the residential area of the infill site contributed to a reduction in
   the LST. The findings suggested that environmentally friendly and
   well-designed infill development can be a good development strategy for
   achieving urban sustainability by mitigating the urban heat island

   Based Social Networks Data}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{During the past few years, the analysis of data generated from
   Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) have aided in the identification
   of urban patterns, understanding activity behaviours in urban areas, as
   well as producing novel recommender systems that facilitate users'
   choices. Recognizing crowd-mobility patterns in cities is very important
   for public safety, traffic managment, disaster management, and urban
   planning. In this article, we propose a framework for Recognizing the
   Crowd Mobility Patterns in Cities using LBSN data. Our proposed
   framework comprises four main components: data gathering, recurrent
   crowd mobility patterns extraction, temporal functional regions
   detection, and visualization component. More specifically, we employ a
   novel approach based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Gaussian
   Kernel Density Estimation for extracting the recurrent crowd-mobility
   patterns in cities illustrating how crowd shifts from one area to
   another during each day across various time slots. Moreover, the
   framework employs a hierarchical clustering-based algorithm for
   identifying what we refer to as temporal functional regions by modeling
   functional areas taking into account temporal variation by means of
   check-ins' categories. We build the framework using a spatial-temporal
   dataset crawled from Twitter for two entire years (2013 and 2014) for
   the area of Manhattan in New York City. We perform a detailed analysis
   of the extracted crowd patterns with an exploratory visualization
   showing that our proposed approach can identify clearly obvious mobility
   patterns that recur over time and location in the urban scenario. Using
   same time interval, we show that correlating the temporal functional
   regions with the recognized recurrent crowd-mobility patterns can yield
   to a deeper understanding of city dynamics and the motivation behind the
   crowd mobility. We are confident that our proposed framework not only
   can help in managing complex city environments and better allocation of
   resources based on the expected crowd mobility and temporal functional
   regions but also can have a direct implication on a variety of
   applications such as personalized recommender systems, anomalous event
   detection, disaster resilience management systems, and others.}},

Title = {{The relationship between transit rich neighborhoods and transit

Abstract = {{The concept of transit-rich neighborhoods (TRNs) has become a focus of
   more interest as it relates to rapidly growing and congested
   communities, and it has received national attention because of its
   contribution to smart growth in the United States. Although most
   investment in transit services has been concentrated in denser central
   cities, where most transit users, including those of low income, reside,
   the trend toward the decentralization of poverty has become evident in
   many metropolitan areas and underscored the need to improve suburban
   transit services. Many studies pertaining to transit ridership have
   focused on the physical characteristics of stations, their catchment
   areas, and equity issues for low-income riders, particularly in central
   cities, without accounting for the evolving socioeconomic
   characteristics of the neighborhoods being served. To address this
   issue, this paper categorizes TRNs based on changing socioeconomic and
   spatial characteristics and uses multiple regression to examine the
   relationship between types of TRNs and transit ridership in the Atlanta
   metropolitan area, focusing on the decentralization of poverty. The
   results show that suburban TRNs became more diverse in terms of income
   and race between 2000 and 2009, which suggests that investment in
   commuter rail transit is an important contribution to social and
   economic equality at the regional level. Furthermore, poverty rates in
   suburban areas, compared to those in their downtown and inner-city
   counterpart TRNs, positively influence the percentage of transit
   ridership. The increased use of suburban transit services suggests the
   potential presence of increased latent demand, which is further
   supported by the decentralization of poverty. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

   transportation systems, and clean and green vehicles. This study is
   based on a critical review of literature in order to establish a
   framework of social behavioral change policies, particularly developed
   and tested for urban mobility and traffic congestion. First, various
   mega cities were compared on different sustainability indicators to
   better understand the case of Istanbul. Then, selected policy
   potentials, namely Travel Demand Management (TDM), were evaluated for
   Istanbul following a set of personal interview surveys aiming to reveal
   travel patterns of residents, their perceptions and attitudes on current
   transport system performance, and their opinions for possible TDM
   interventions in the future. We proposed a multiplicative model to
   process data from these surveys as inputs, which would then be used to
   determine travel demand. A simulation model was constructed using
   PTV-VISSIM tool and validated with current traffic congestion metrics
   obtained from field measurements in a selected district of Istanbul.
   Based on this validated simulation model, projections of traffic
   conditions in the future under different TDM scenarios were predicted
   with the help of determined TDM potentials obtained from the survey
   results. As a result of this study, it was revealed that the traffic
   congestion levels in Istanbul tend to become worse year by year under
   existing conditions, but it was also found that the TDM policies offer
   significant potential for reducing congestion, hence its consequent
   hazards, via increased use of sustainable mobility modes without the
   need for new infrastructure investments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a critical understanding of the smart city by
   investigating the values and ideas that underpin this concept and how
   they are translated into practice. It suggests that, despite private
   companies and municipalities promoting the smart city as a revolutionary
   utopia, this utopia is, on the contrary, an expression of the neoliberal
   ideology. The case study of the Italian city of Genoa shows that the
   smart city utopia acts as a generator of a collective imaginary while
   promoting the interests of business elites and diverting the attention
   away from urgent urban problems, such as urbanization. The neoliberal
   ideology influences the framing of these problems by favoring
   business-led technological solutions rather than political and long-term
   urban planning. The study suggests that this business-led utopia has
   important implications in terms of accountability of the actors
   involved.}},

Abstract = {{Smart cities are comprised of diverse and interconnected components
   constantly exchanging data and facilitating improved living for a
   nation's population. Our view of a typical smart city consists of four
   key components, namely, Smart Grids, Building Automation Systems (BAS),
   Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Smart Vehicles; with enabling Internet
   of Things (IoT) sensors and the Cloud platform. The adversarial threats
   and criminal misuses in a smart city are increasingly heterogenous and
   significant, with provisioning of resilient and end-to-end security
   being a daunting task. When a cyber incident involving critical
   components of the smart city infrastructure occurs, appropriate measures
   can be taken to identify and enumerate concrete evidence to facilitate
   the forensic investigation process. Forensic preparedness and lessons
   learned from past forensic analysis can help protect the smart city
   against future incidents. This paper presents a holistic view of the
   security landscape of a smart city, identifying security threats and
   providing deep insight into digital investigation in the context of the

   geography and the new human condition}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{156}},
Pages = {{147-154}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The New Human Condition (NHC) is perhaps the largest cognitive challenge
   in history to human intelligence and agency and concerns our species'
   ability to cope with the consequences and responsibilities of being the
   major driver of planetary change in the twenty-first century (Palsson et
   al., 2013; Holm et al., 2015). But despite long held assumptions about
   intra-disciplinary engagements between its ``human{''} and
   ``physical{''} branches, geography's weakness as a discipline is that it
   has yet to gather sufficient momentum to collectively shape and
   implement practical and sustainable climate change policies and actions
   (Castree, 2014a). However, by considering together the heuristic values
   of the concepts of the Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries, the
   Anglo-American sphere of geography recognizes in either ironic, or
   unconscious manners that a new strand of environmental determinism
   (discredited by geographical thought and practice in the early twentieth
   century) has re-emerged to elide the role of human agency and broadly
   dominate the discussion of climate change. Mike Hulme (2011, 247) states
   that ``climate determinism{''} is ``a form of analysis and prediction in
   which climate is first extracted from the matrix of interdependencies
   that shape human life within the physical world{''}. Within this
   discourse it is often the biophysical sphere that is employed to explain
   the course of human behavior; consequently, this dominating perspective
   threatens to skew our predictions and understandings of future
   societies, cultures, climates and destinies. Climate change will
   certainly constrain human agency, but it also creates the potential for
   geography to play to its intra and inter disciplinary strengths and
   begin discussing and addressing human-environmental dilemmas in
   practical and realistic ways; and secondly, seize the climate change
   crisis as an opportunity to study where, why and for whom global
   environmental change matters. Firstly, this paper considers a
   theoretical balance between the NHC, the Anthropocene and Planetary
   Boundaries as a way forward for geography to begin addressing the common
   dilemma of climate change. Within this consideration it engages Anne
   Buttimer's geographical translation of Martin Heidegger's lebenswelt as
   a dimension of the NHC. Secondly, the paper discusses how GeoHumanities
   and GlScience integrations with phenomenology, the digital and
   environmental humanities and social media generated ``Big-Data{''} can
   explore the perceptual scales and scopes of the
   NHC/Anthropocene/Planetary Boundaries conceptual triad. Lastly, it
   argues that such integrations are salient to the study of emerging Smart
   City Lifeworlds as a means to engage the increasing urban agencies of
   global climate change driven by the vagaries of the human condition. (C)

Abstract = {{Two major extreme-weather events occurred in New York State between 2011
   and 2012. Each with the odds of a 100-year occurrence suggesting that
   such extreme events are the region's ``new normal.{''} City and state
   policy-makers, in response, are studying how to develop a network of
   robust, resilient critical infrastructure facilities. These studies,
   however, typically fail to address interdependencies among critical
   infrastructures and lack a quantitative tool to investigate the maximum
   resilience possessed by a given infrastructure facility in the face of
   climate-change-induced hazards.
   We propose a multi-stage stochastic mathematical program to maximize
   network resilience given: i) random arrival of extreme events; ii) the
   network's inherent capacity to withstand and cope with the aftermath of
   exogenous shocks; iii) pre-, during-, and post-event strategies
   available to enhance system operability; and iv) budgeting and
   technological restrictions facing policy-makers. Our approach allows
   both qualitative and quantitative paradigms to interact.
   Our model thus clarifies how to allocate resources proactively and how
   the network's absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities can be
   coordinated to enhance overall system resilience. Our findings suggest
   that an integrated planning approach combined with smart allocation of
   resources across a network's main elements creates a greater degree of
   resilience while utilizing less costly resilience-enhancing strategies.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Despite the impressive growth of smart city initiatives worldwide, an
   organizational theory of smart city has yet to be developed, and we lack
   models addressing the unprecedented organizational and management
   challenges that emerge in smart city contexts. Traditional models are
   often of little use, because smart cities pursue different goals than
   traditional organizations, are based on networked, cross-boundary
   activity systems, rely on distributed innovation processes, and imply
   adaptive policy-making. Complex combinations of factors may lead to
   vicious or virtuous cycles in smart city initiatives, but we know very
   little about how these factors may be identified and mapped. Based on an
   inductive study of a set of primary and secondary sources, we develop a
   framework for the configurational analysis of smart cities viewed as
   place-specific organizational fields. This framework identifies five key
   dimensions in the configurations of smart city fields; these five
   dimensions are mapped through five sub-frameworks, which can be used
   both separately as well as for an integrated analysis. Our contribution
   is conceived to support longitudinal studies, natural experiments and
   comparative analyses on smart city fields, and to improve our
   understanding of how different combinations of factors affect the
   capability of smart innovations to translate into city resilience,
   sustainability and quality of life. In addition, our results suggest
   that new forms of place-based entrepreneurship constitute the engine
   that allows for the dynamic collaboration between government, citizens
   and research centers in successful smart city organizational fields.}},

Abstract = {{Green space exposure has been positively correlated with better
   mental-health indicators in several high income countries, but has not
   been examined in low-and middle-income countries undergoing rapid
   urbanization. Building on a study of mental health in adults with a
   pre-existing chronic condition, we examined the association between park
   availability and major depression among 1208 adults surveyed in Delhi,
   India. Major depression was measured using the Mini International
   Neuropsychiatric Interview. The ArcGIS platform was used to quantify
   park availability indexed as (i) park distance from households, (ii)
   area of the nearest park; and within one km buffer area around
   households - the (iii) number and (iv) total area of all parks.
   Mixed-effects logistic regression models adjusted for socio-demographic
   characteristics indicated that relative to residents exposed to the
   largest nearest park areas (tertile 3), the odds {[}95\% confidence
   interval] of major depression was 3.1 {[}1.4-7.0] times higher among
   residents exposed to the smallest nearest park areas (tertile 1) and 2.1
   {[}0.9-4.8] times higher in residents with mid-level exposure (tertile
   2). There was no statistically significant association between other
   park variables tested and major depression. We hypothesized that
   physical activity in the form of walking, perceived stress levels and
   satisfaction with the neighborhood environment may have mediating
   effects on the association between nearest park area and major
   depression. We found no significant mediation effects for any of our
   hypothesized variables. In conclusion, our results provide preliminary
   and novel evidence from India that availability of large parks in the
   immediate neighborhood positively impacts mental well-being of
   individuals with pre-existing chronic conditions, at the opportune time
   when India is embarking on the development of sustainable cities that
   aim to promote health through smart urban design - one of the key
   elements of which is the inclusion of urban green spaces.}},

Abstract = {{The United Nations (UN) reports that the global population reached 7
   billion in 2011, and today, it stands at about 7.3 billion. This
   dramatic increase has been driven largely by the extension of people's
   lifetime. The urban population has been also increasing, which causes a
   lot of issues for cities, such as congestion and increased demand for
   resources, including energy, water, sanitation, education, and
   healthcare services. A smart city has been expected a lot to solve those
   issues. The concept of a smart city is not new. Due to the progress of
   information and communication technology (ICT), including the Internet
   of Things (IoT) and big data (BD), the concept of a smart city has been
   being realized in various aspects. This paper introduces the concept and

Abstract = {{More than a decade ago, Akhil Gupta and James Ferguson set out to define
   a research program with their essay `Spatializing States: Toward an
   Ethnography of Neoliberal Governmentality' (2002). Exploring the
   relation between what they referred to as `the spatial and statist
   orders,' they argued that conceptualizations of the nature of the state
   have not attended adequately to the ways in which states are spatialized
   and endeavored to show, through ethnography, how people come to
   experience the state as an entity with certain spatial characteristics
   and properties. Building on these ideas, but also moving beyond their
   taken-for-granted assumptions about the state's spatiality, this essay
   makes use of one ethnographic case example in an effort to offer a
   fine-grained illustration of the spatial dimensions of the project of
   state securitization in the urban landscape. I do this by looking
   closely at the field of urban mobility in Beirut, Lebanon, and the
   Twitter account for the city's Traffic Management Center, launched in
   late 2013 by the Ministry of Interior. Through my analysis of the
   spatial modes of statecraft that are produced through this Twitter
   account, I develop an argument about how the social media technology of
   Twitter serves as a portal through which to view how the state secures
   its legitimacy and naturalizes its authority in both virtual and
   physical space, while, at the same time, this technology - if only
   fleetingly - can be harnessed to issue challenges to this legitimacy and
   authority. What is at stake in the Traffic Management Center's Twitter
   account, I suggest, is the production of the state as an entity that is
   not just powerful in the sense of being vertical to society and
   encompassing of urban space, but the very idea that the state offers
   security and protection to its citizens.}},

Abstract = {{Safety issues while driving in smart cities are considered to be
   top-notch priority in contrast to traveling. Today's fast paced society,
   often leads to accidents. In order to reduce the road accidents, one key
   area of research is monitoring the driving behavior of drivers.
   Understanding the driver behavior is an essential component in
   Intelligent Driver Assistance Systems. One of potential cause of traffic
   fatalities is aggressive driving behavior. However, drivers are not
   fully aware of their aggressive actions. So, in order to increase
   awareness and to promote driver safety, a novel system has been
   proposed. In this work, we focus on DTW based event detection technique,
   which have not been researched in motion sensors based time series data
   to a great extent. Our motivation is to improve the classification
   accuracy to detect sudden braking and aggressive driving behaviors using
   sensory data collected from smartphone. A very significant feature of
   DTW is to be able to automatically cope with time deformations and
   different speeds associated with time-dependent data which makes it
   suitable for our chosen application where data might get affected due to
   factors such as: high variability in road and vehicle conditions,
   heterogeneous smartphone sensors, etc. Our technique is novel as it uses
   fusion of sensors to enhance detection accuracy. The experimental
   results show that proposed algorithm outperforms the existing machine
   learning and threshold-based techniques with 100\% detection rate of
   braking events and 97\% \& 86.67\% detection rate of normal left \&
   right turns and aggressive left \& right turns respectively. (C) 2017

Title = {{An approach to geometry-based dynamic location referencing}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Introduction An important requirement for knowledge infrastructures in
   smart cities is the continuous updating of location-based information.
   Protocols for dynamic location referencing like e.g. OpenLR or AGORA-C
   tackle the problem of accurately matching locations between dissimilar
   digital maps. They are map-agnostic and aim at limiting the amount of
   descriptive data to reduce bandwidth. However, there are applications
   for which the weaker requirement of map-independence is completely
   adequate, and for some there are even no restrictions in bandwidth (e.g.
   in the EC-funded project ROSATTE, and in the DLR projects MobiLind and
   KeepMoving), and with relaxed constraints it is possible to learn from
   methods in similar areas like road network matching and map conflation,
   in order to achieve a more accurate solution. Following this path, this
   paper presents a map-independent approach developed in the ongoing DLR
   project I. MoVe, which can be combined with a bandwidth-efficient
   dynamic location referencing method like e.g. OpenLR to target
   applications with bandwidth restrictions.
   Methods The proposed new approach works line-oriented and is guided by a
   measure of geometric dissimilarity. It is a top-down approach,
   recursively splitting up the source route into parts, thereby following
   a divide-and-conquer strategy to reduce the problem until it can be
   solved trivially.
   Results It is currently capable of mapping closed line locations (i.e.
   circular routes, representing either the boundaries of areas or the
   tours of e.g. delivery trucks) from a TeleAtlas map to a NAVTEQ map
   on-the-fly with a success rate of 97.5\% (OpenLR: only 82.5\%), and also
   capable of mapping short line locations (i.e. linear routes) on-the-fly
   between the same maps, with a success rate of 99.7\% (OpenLR: 91.9\%).
   Conclusion In conclusion, the new approach to match linear or circular
   routes between two dissimilar maps is highly accurate and
   map-independent, but access to both involved maps is required. The
   approach can also be combined with a bandwidth-efficient dynamic
   location referencing method like e.g. OpenLR to obtain a compact format
   before the descriptive data is transmitted.}},

Title = {{Smart urban freight planning process: integrating desk, living lab and
   modelling approaches in decision-making}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This paper proposes an innovative approach to decision-making
   processes for urban freight planning that could easily be transferred
   across cities while capable of jointly taking into account: (1) all the
   conceivable and updated urban freight transport (UFT) measures that
   should apply to the specific city culture, structure and evolution, (2)
   all the relevant stakeholders and successfully involve them from the
   beginning, (3) behavioural, technical, operational, organisational and
   financial issues.
   Methods The methodology is organised and deployed in three phases,
   following three different approaches, i.e.: a ``desk approach{''} for
   data acquisition and knowledge-based policy rankings; a ``living lab
   approach{''} to foster stakeholders' engagement in co-creating policies;
   a ``modelling approach{''} to evaluate policies and find/define an
   optimised mix of shared applicable/effective policies.
   Results The three-phase methodology supports public authorities in: (a)
   increasing knowledge and understanding of the most innovative
   context-specific UFT policies; (b) integrating UFT policies in strategic
   urban planning via collaborative participation/governance processes; (c)
   developing an ex-ante behaviourally consistent, financially robust and
   technically compatible assessment of shared UFT policy mixes while
   providing appropriate instruments to facilitate policy adoption and
   deployment.
   Conclusions The proposed methodology contributes to the identification
   and development of effective UFT solutions. Bringing together knowledge
   acquisition, policy co-creation, behaviour change analysis within a
   single methodological approach, aimed at identifying an optimised policy
   package, is both new and needed.}},

Abstract = {{Post-cold-war-era conflicts and the humanitarian political economy have
   driven two disparate yet concurrent shifts within the humanitarian
   field. On one hand, new public management-style reforms have
   increasingly focused organizations on efficiency, deliverables and
   technical proficiency. On the other, an international rights regime has
   demanded that humanitarian interventions and actions become more
   explicitly political. Nowhere are the tensions between neutral
   humanitarian expertise and the need for overt political engagement more
   visible than for organizations promoting refugee protection in fluid,
   politically pluralistic urban sites. Building on fieldwork in
   Johannesburg, Kampala and Nairobi, we argue that neutrality, technical
   fixes and demands for direct and targeted service delivery can undermine
   long-term urban protection. Rather, protection requires enhanced local
   literacy and pursuing back routes to rights through engagement with
   municipal authorities, local actors and policy sectors. In other words,
   humanitarian organizations must work smarter, smaller and stealthier.
   But, to do this, the sector requires substantial shifts in its funding
   regime-including reconsidering demands for measurable outputs, strictly
   targeted services and rapid direct service delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic congestion is a major mobility problem, which generates enormous
   economic resources and causes serious problems for the most dense of
   cities. Intelligent transportation systems based on vehicular ad-doc
   network (VANET) communications will improve many services, expressively,
   related to transport, security, reliability, management and including
   the assistance in the reduction of traffic congestion. In this context,
   we propose an intelligent system based, firstly, on a new clustering
   technique to control and maintain the stability of routes during
   inter-vehicular communications, and secondly, a bio-inspired
   systematically conducting mobility measurement of agent, intervening in
   cases of traffic congestion, in order to find new routes to those
   offered by the global positioning system. Obviously, by providing an
   appropriate route selection process, such routing concept could be
   helpful in exchanging control messages to inform the nearest medics
   willing to give first aid and routing of another alert to the nearest
   ambulance. Thus, in order to deal with these sophisticated optimization
   techniques, we evaluate in this article means of simulation experiments.
   According to that, we have anticipated particular incidents suitable to
   estimate the pertinence of the proposed system. The analysis and
   implementation in VANET will be based on three simulators, especially,
   SUMO, MOVE and NS2. The results prove the effectiveness of the approach
   by reducing fuel consumption and emissions along with the rest of

Abstract = {{Purpose: Studies on how the interaction of psychological and
   environmental characteristics influences walking are limited, and the
   results are inconsistent. Our aim is to examine how the attitude toward
   walking and neighborhood environments interacts to influence walking.
   Design: Cross-sectional phone and mail survey.
   Setting: Participants randomly sampled from 6 study sites including Los
   Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore, Minneapolis, Manhattan, and Bronx Counties
   in New York City, and Forsyth and Davidson Counties in North Carolina.
   Participants: The final sample consisted of 2621 persons from 2011 to
   2012.
   Measures: Total minutes of walking for travel or leisure, attitude
   toward walking, and perceptions of the neighborhood environments were
   self-reported. Street Smart (SS) Walk Score (a measure of walkability
   derived from a variety of geographic data) was obtained for each
   residential location.
   Analysis: Linear regression models adjusting for age, gender,
   race/ethnicity, education, and income.
   Results: Attitude toward walking was positively associated with walking
   for both purposes. Walking for travel was significantly associated with
   SS Walk Score, whereas walking for leisure was not. The SS Walk Score
   and selected perceived environment characteristics were associated with
   walking in people with a very positive attitude toward walking but were
   not associated with walking in people with a less positive attitude.
   Conclusion: Attitudes toward walking and neighborhood environments
   interact to affect walking behavior.}},

Title = {{Enhancing reliability in Wireless Sensor Networks for adaptive river
   monitoring systems: Reflections on their long-term deployment in Brazil}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{41-52}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Several adaptive systems have been proposed that are based on the
   concepts of smart cities, Which can be successfully adapted to natural
   disasters or other public safety concerns. Since these systems are
   embedded in a critical and dynamic environment, it is really important
   to have an infrastructure that is capable of providing real-time
   environmental information. This paper discusses two research questions
   that arise from adaptive ubicomp systems: (i) what are the key
   requirements to provide a reliable WSN-based system (e.g. a river
   monitoring system)? and (ii) how can an adaptable and reliable WSN-based
   system be developed? This paper seeks to respond to the former question
   with the aid of the RESS standard platform. The latter question is
   answered by employing a generic approach for adaptation. The term
   ``critical systems{''}, means that any error may result in the loss of
   human life. We devised the RESS standard after deploying the WSN-based
   river monitoring system in Brazil for five years. Our prototype
   underwent several trials, sometimes leading to failure or damage, before
   we came up with a more reliable solution, which is outlined in this
   article. Finally, while our RESS platform is policy-free, it is
   extensible/adaptable and hence can naturally be adapted to new policies.

Title = {{SIMONI (SMART INTEGRATED MONITORING) AS A NOVEL BIOANALYTICAL STRATEGY
   FOR WATER QUALITY ASSESSMENT: PART II-FIELD FEASIBILITY SURVEY}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Because it is impossible to chemically analyze all relevant
   micropollutants, the implementation of bioanalytical tools is essential
   to estimate ecological risks of chemical mixtures in regular
   water-monitoring programs. The first tier of the Smart Integrated
   Monitoring (SIMONI) strategy, which was described in part I, is based on
   the combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical measurements.
   Bioassay responses are compared with effect-based trigger values (EBT),
   and an overall SIMONI score on all bioassay data was designed to
   indicate environmental risks. The present study is focused on analyzing
   the feasibility of the hazard identification tier by evaluating results
   of 45 field campaigns at sites with different pollution profiles near
   the city of Amsterdam. A Daphnia assay was performed in situ, while
   silicon rubber or polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS)
   extracts were tested with 4 nonspecific (daphnids, algae, bacteria, and
   cell culture) and 10 specific (9 Chemical Activated Luciferase Gene
   Expression {[}CALUX] assays and antibiotics scan) bioassays. Sensitivity
   analyses demonstrated the relevance of 2 classification variables in the
   SIMONI score formula on all bioanalytical data. The model indicated
   increased risks for the ecosystem at surface waters in greenhouse areas
   and undiluted wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The choice of
   testing specific bioassays on either polar or nonpolar passive sampling
   extracts is cost-effective and still provided meaningful insights on
   micropollutant risks. Statistical analyses revealed that the model
   provides a relevant overall impact assessment based on bioassay
   responses. Data analyses on the chemically determined mixture toxic
   pressure and bioanalytical methods provided similar insights in relative
   risk ranking of water bodies. The SIMONI combination of passive sampling
   and bioanalytical testing appears to be a feasible strategy to identify
   chemical hazards. (C) 2017 SETAC}},

Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{52-70}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, it has been attempted to present a temperature control
   method for the building and, simultaneously, reduce costs of providing
   energy in hybrid heating systems. In the present work, a building in
   Tehran city has been investigated as a sample during a single day and
   applying intelligent control methods in the presence of two gas and
   solar heat sources. Furthermore, the influence of each of these methods
   has been studied on reducing costs as well as regulating indoor
   temperature. In the next step, the utilized controllers have been
   redesigned for the laboratory model and their capability has been
   evaluated through experimental tests. Based on the acquired results, it
   is deduced that, compared to other methods, utilizing a PID controller
   optimized by genetic algorithm not only reduces 50\% of energy providing
   costs, but also regulates the inner temperature of the Lab model with an
   error lower than 1\%. This method is faster than the others in
   regulating the model temperature. However, in the real building modeling
   case, the efficiency of this method has been reduced relative to the
   laboratory model, mostly because of variable conditions such as variable
   solar emission intensity during different hours of the day. Yet,
   acceptable results have been acquired by performing MPC and correct
   modeling. These results show that, as the variable parameters increase,
   the MPC presents higher capability compared to other methods In this
   case, the MPC has similar costs to the genetic algorithm while it
   regulates the temperature faster and with lower error. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Traffic signals play a critical role in smart cities for mitigating
   traffic congestions and reducing the emission in metropolitan areas.
   This paper proposes a bi-level optimization framework to settle the
   optimal traffic signal setting problem. The upper-level problem
   determines the traffic signal settings to minimize the drivers' average
   travel time, while the lower-level problem aims for achieving the
   network equilibrium using the settings calculated at the upper level.
   Genetic algorithm is employed with the integration of
   microscopic-traffic-simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) to
   decouple the complex bi-level problem into tractable single-level
   problems, which are solved sequentially. Case studies on a synthetic
   traffic network and a real-world traffic subnetwork are conducted to
   examine the effectiveness of the proposed model and relevant solution
   methods. Additional strategies are provided for the extension of the
   proposed model and the acceleration of solution process in large-area

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This article questions the strict parallelism of demographic and
   economic development in characterising urban shrinkage in Germany. As
   the cases of several Ruhr cities and East German cities prove, urban
   economic growth can be achieved thanks to the substantial presence of
   modern industries and business services, and despite declines in
   population size. Serious shrinkages of Halle, Cottbus and Schwerin are
   primarily due to failures in the post-industrial transformation process.
   Recent policy measures strongly oriented towards slowing the downsizing
   process of population (via e.g. urban regeneration strategies) do not
   appear to be sufficient for achieving urban resurgence in these cities.
   More active industrial policy measures are required there to create a
   competitive high-tech manufacturing sector, to stimulate innovation
   activities and to boost its growth interdependence with modern local
   services and R\&D infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Residential relocation choice is affected by numerous factors, but
   gasoline prices as a potential factor have not been investigated. This
   study examines gasoline price changes and residential relocation choice
   using 1996-2008 American Housing Survey data. We found higher gasoline
   prices are associated with a higher percentage of movers choosing
   locations closer to workplaces. The findings have implications for
   addressing the impacts of volatile gasoline prices on land use planning
   and policies; resilient smart cities or communities are one possible
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{The incorporation of electronics by embedding the relevant sensors in
   the physical devices in home and office, vehicles of all types,
   buildings in the smart cities and in all possible spheres of life form a
   network of devices termed as internet of things (IoT). It is being
   realized that vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) which are responsible
   for the reliable and secure communication among vehicles is a primary
   area of research in IoT and hence ensuring security in this area is
   essential. Thus, this work introduces a novel approach to improve the
   existing authentication support to VANETs. In this proposed framework,
   first an anonymous authentication approach for preserving the privacy is
   proposed which not only performs the vehicle user's anonymous
   authentication but preserves the message integrity of the transmitting
   messages as well. Although many anonymous authentication schemes have
   been proposed in VANETs until now, the existing schemes suffer from a
   high computation cost during the signature and certificate verification
   process which leads to delayed authentication. Consequently, the
   vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) cannot authenticate more number of
   vehicles per second in VANETs. Second, an efficient anonymous group key
   distribution protocol is proposed in this paper for securely
   distributing the group key to the group of vehicles in the communication
   range of an RSU. The RSUs can send location based information to the
   group of vehicles in a secure manner using this group key. Experimental
   analysis portrays that the results of this new privacy preserving
   anonymous authentication and key management schemes are promising and
   efficient with regard to signature verification cost and computational
   cost in comparison with the existing schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Firms that want to exploit Smart City's opportunities need to cooperate
   with local governments. From a managerial point of view, there is scant
   research on how to select public partners in Smart City projects. In
   fact, while there are several cities claiming to be smart', not all
   cities fulfil the essential requirements for successful Smart City
   projects. This paper shows how to build successful public-private
   alliances in Smart Cities and, more specifically, how to select the
   right city to test, develop or sell smart technologies. This study uses
   a multiple-case research design and follows an exploratory and
   qualitative methodology. The results show that firms improve the success
   of their projects if they assess three main aspects of partner
   selection, these being partner complementarity, commitment and
   compatibility. The paper, therefore, provides several managerial
   implications regarding how firms may be more effective in selecting
   where to start their Smart City projects and how public organisations
   may become more attractive. Finally, academic implications, limitations
   and future lines of research are presented.}},

Title = {{A novel hybrid forwarding strategy for content delivery in wireless
   information-centric networks}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{104-116}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Information-centric networking (ICN) is a promising solution for content
   delivery in multi-hop wireless networks. In these environments, the ICN
   forwarding strategies typically rely on broadcasting, which facilitates
   content distribution by taking advantage of the shared medium, but
   brings about undesirable side effects. To avoid the broadcast-related
   issues of packet redundancy and unreliability due its unacknowledged
   mode, a few recent proposals advocated unicasting as the communication
   mode to resort to, once the content provider has been discovered.
   However, unicasting may suffer from connectivity breakages due to node
   mobility and harsh propagation conditions, and, generally, limits the
   data sharing capability of the wireless medium.
   In this paper, we design a robust ICN-based forwarding strategy, called
   Ad Hoc Dynamic Unicast (ADU), that wisely harnesses unicast and
   broadcast primitives on top of IEEE 802.11-based wireless networks. ADU
   relies on unicasting for content dissemination after the provider
   discovery, and promptly falls back to broadcast to find a new content
   provider in case of a link failure notified by the Medium Access Control
   (MAC) layer. Extensive simulations in two different multi-hop wireless
   scenarios, i.e., mobile and vehicular ad hoc networks, under different
   load settings, assess the ADU performance against benchmark ICN
   forwarding schemes, representative of broadcast-based and unicast-based
   solutions. Results show that ADU outperforms them in all circumstances,
   proving its better responsiveness to link failures, which guarantees a
   shorter content retrieval delay and a lower message overhead and energy
   consumption. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The increasingly pervasive phenomenon of light pollution spans several
   different fields of concern, including the loss of the night sky, energy
   wastage, and the effects of artificial light on circadian rhythms and
   nocturnal ecology. Although the scale of the problem has grown
   significantly in recent decades, the underlying dynamics remain only
   partially understood beyond the identification of specific technological
   pathways such as the rise of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or the
   capitalist transformation of the nocturnal realm. It is suggested that
   current approaches to the study of light, including the identification
   of urban atmospheres, the elaboration of existing approaches to urban
   ecology, or the extension of smart city type discourses, do not capture
   the full complexity of the politics of light under late modernity.

Abstract = {{As a new form of sustainable development, the concept ``Smart Cities{''}
   knows a large expansion during the recent years. It represents an urban
   model, refers to all alternative approaches to metropolitan IC's case to
   enhance quality and performance of urban service for better interaction
   between citizens and government. However, the smart cities based on
   distributed and autonomous information infrastructure contains millions
   of information sources that will be expected more than 50 billion
   devices connected by using IoT or other similar technologies in 2020. In
   Information Technology, we often need to process and reason with
   information coming from various sources (sensors, experts, models).
   Information is almost always tainted with various kinds of imperfection:
   imprecision, uncertainty, ambiguity, we need a theoretical framework
   general enough to allow for the representation, propagation and
   combination of all kinds of imperfect information. The theory of belief
   functions is one such Framework. Real-time data generated from
   autonomous and distributed sources can contain all sorts of
   imperfections regarding on the quality of data e.g. imprecision,
   uncertainty, ignorance andlor incompleteness. Any imperfection in data
   within smart city can have an adverse effect over the performance of
   urban services and decision making. In this context, we address in this
   article the problem of imperfection in smart city data. We will focus on
   handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and
   data integration and we will create an evidential database by using the
   evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. The
   expected outcomes from this paper are (1) to focus on handling
   imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data
   integration (2) to create an evidential database by using the evidence
   theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. As
   experimentation we present a special case of modeling imperfect data in
   the field of Healthcare. An evidential database will be built which will
   contain all the perfect and imperfect data. These data come from several
   Heterogeneous sources in a context of Smart Cities. Imperfect aspects in
   the evidential database expressed by the theory of beliefs that will
   present in this paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper (a substantial extension of the short version presented at
   REM2016 on April 19-21, Maldives {[} 1]), multi-objective power
   dispatching is discussed in the scope of microgrids located in smart
   cities. The proposed system considers the use of Plug-in Electric
   Vehicle (PEV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as storage units. The
   problem involves distinct types of vehicles and a community, composed of
   small houses, residential areas and different Renewable Energy
   Resources. In order to highlight possibilities for power dispatching,
   the optimization of three distinct goals is considered in the analysis:
   mini/microgrid total costs; usage of vehicles batteries; and maximum
   grid peak load. Sets of non-dominated solutions are obtained using a
   mathematical programming based heuristic (Matheuristic). By analyzing
   cases of study composed with up to 70 vehicles, we emphasize that PEVs
   and UAVs can effectively contribute for renewable energy integration
   into mini/microgrid systems. Smart cities policy makers and citizens are

Abstract = {{As the new generation of smart sensors is evolving towards high sampling
   acquisitions systems, the amount of information to be handled by
   learning algorithms has been increasing. The Graphics Processing Unit
   (GPU) architecture provides a greener alternative with low energy
   consumption for mining big data, bringing the power of thousands of
   processing cores into a single chip, thus opening a wide range of
   possible applications. In this paper (a substantial extension of the
   short version presented at REM2016 on April 19-21, Maldives {[}1]), we
   design a novel parallel strategy for time series learning, in which
   different parts of the time series are evaluated by different threads.
   The proposed strategy is inserted inside the core a hybrid metaheuristic
   model, applied for learning patterns from an important mini/microgrid
   forecasting problem, the household electricity demand forecasting. The
   future smart cities will surely rely on distributed energy generation,
   in which citizens should be aware about how to manage and control their
   own resources. In this sense, energy disaggregation research will be
   part of several typical and useful microgrid applications. Computational
   results show that the proposed GPU learning strategy is scalable as the
   number of training rounds increases, emerging as a promising deep
   learning tool to be embedded into smart sensors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Trajectory-based vehicle tracking at low frame rates}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{46-57}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{In smart cities, an intelligent traffic surveillance system plays a
   crucial role in reducing traffic jams and air pollution, thus improving
   the quality of life. An intelligent traffic surveillance should be able
   to detect and track multiple vehicles in real-time using only limited
   resources. Conventional tracking methods usually run at a high
   video-sampling rate, assuming that the same vehicles in successive
   frames are similar and move only slightly. However, in cost effective
   embedded surveillance systems (e.g., a distributed wireless network of
   smart cameras), video frame rates are typically low because of limited
   system resources. Therefore, conventional tracking methods perform
   poorly in embedded surveillance systems because of discontinuity of the
   moving vehicles in the captured recordings. In this study, we present a
   fast and light algorithm that is suitable for an embedded real-time
   visual surveillance system to detect effectively and track multiple
   moving vehicles whose appearance and/or position changes abruptly at a
   low frame rate. For effective tracking at low frame rates, we propose a
   new matching criterion based on greedy data association using appearance
   and position similarities between detections and trackers. To manage
   abrupt appearance changes, manifold learning is used to calculate
   appearance similarity. To manage abrupt changes in motion, the next
   probable centroid area of the tracker is predicted using trajectory
   information. The position similarity is then calculated based on the
   predicted next position and progress direction of the tracker. The
   proposed method demonstrates efficient tracking performance during rapid
   feature changes and is tested on an embedded platform (ARM with
   DSP-based system). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) will transform our daily life by making
   different aspects of life smart like smart home, smart workplace, smart
   health and smart city etc. IoT is based on network of physical objects
   equipped with sensors and actuators that can gather and share data with
   other objects or humans. Secure communication is required for successful
   working of IoT. In this paper, a total of 13 lightweight cryptographic
   algorithms are evaluated based on their implementation results on 8-bit,
   16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers and their appropriateness is
   examined for resource-constrained scenarios like IoT. These algorithms
   are analysed by dissecting them into their logical and structural
   elements. This paper tries to investigate the relationships between the
   structural elements of an algorithm and its performance. Association
   rule mining is used to find association patterns among the constituent
   elements of the selected ciphers and their performance. Interesting
   results are found on the type of element used to improve the cipher in
   terms of code size, RAM requirement and execution time. This paper will
   serve as a guideline for cryptographic designers to design improved
   ciphers for resource constrained environments like IoT.}},

Abstract = {{Current worldwide energy challenges require the synergy of
   multidisciplinary actions and activities affecting different
   stakeholders, such as governments, utility companies, and citizens. In
   recent years, these needs are being addressed through the integration of
   the Smart Grid paradigm with the so-called Internet of Things, in order
   to make energy decisions aware of data from devices that are physically
   deployed on a smart city. However, to address such concerns, many of the
   scenarios from this resulting ecosystem, require huge amounts of data in
   order to make efficient and effective decisions about energy
   distribution and saving. In this sense, the application of proper
   security mechanisms to allow the selective disclosure of information to
   the intended parties is crucial to guarantee that users' privacy is not
   harmed. In this work, we propose the application of specific
   attribute-based access control technologies to protect the energy data
   that are outsourced from different devices. This integration is part of
   the ongoing work within MiMurcia Smart City project, which is intended

Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Dye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs) have niche prospects for
   electricity-generating windows that could equip buildings for
   energy-sustainable future cities. However, this `smart window'
   technology is being held back by a lack of understanding in how the dye
   interacts with its device environment at the molecular level. A better
   appreciation of the dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2
   interfacial structure of the DSC working electrodes would be
   particularly valuable since associated structure-function relationships
   could be established; these rules would provide a `toolkit' for the
   molecular engineering of more suitable DSC dyes via rational design.
   Previous materials characterisation efforts have been limited to
   determining this interfacial structure within an environment exposed to
   air or situated in a solvent medium. This study is the first to reveal
   the structure of this buried interface within the functional device
   environment, and represents the first application of in situ neutron
   reflectometry to DSC research. By incorporating the electrolyte into the
   structural model of this buried interface, we reveal how lithium cations
   from the electrolyte constituents influence the dye center dot center
   dot center dot TiO2 binding configuration of an organic sensitiser,
   MK-44, via Li+ complexation to the cyanoacrylate group. This dye is the
   molecular congener of the high-performance MK-2 DSC dye, whose
   hexa-alkyl chains appear to stabilise it from Li+ complexation. Our in
   situ neutron reflectometry findings are built up from auxiliary
   structural models derived from ex situ X-ray reflectometry and
   corroborated via density functional theory and UV/vis absorption
   spectroscopy. Significant differences between the in situ and ex situ
   dye center dot center dot center dot TiO2 interfacial structures are
   found, highlighting the need to characterise the molecular structure of
   DSC working electrodes while in a fully assembled device.}},

Abstract = {{India's ever increasing population has made it necessary to develop
   alternative modes of transportation with electric vehicles being the
   most preferred option. The major obstacle is the deteriorating impact on
   the utility distribution system brought about by improper setup of these
   charging stations. This paper deals with the optimal planning (siting
   and sizing) of charging station infrastructure in the city of Allahabad,
   India. This city is one of the upcoming smart cities, where electric
   vehicle transportation pilot project is going on under Government of
   India initiative. In this context, a hybrid algorithm based on genetic
   algorithm and improved version of conventional particle swarm
   optimization is utilized for finding optimal placement of charging
   station in the Allahabad distribution system. The particle swarm
   optimization algorithm re-optimizes the received sub-optimal solution
   (site and the size of the station) which leads to an improvement in the
   algorithm functionality and enhances quality of solution. The genetic
   algorithm and improved version of conventional particle swarm
   optimization algorithm will also be compared with a conventional genetic
   algorithm and particle swarm optimization. Through simulation studies on
   a real time system of Allahabad city, the superior performance of the
   aforementioned technique with respect to genetic algorithm and particle
   swarm optimization in terms of improvement in voltage profile and

Title = {{Convolution integral vs. finite difference for the inverse problem of
   detection of a contamination source in rivers}},

Abstract = {{The identification of the source of a contamination in a river, either
   accidental or intentional, is of extreme interest for both the technical
   and scientific communities. To this aim, the recent development of
   innovative wireless sensors, coupled with computational tools capable of
   analyzing big data almost in real-time, offers novel opportunities to
   develop early warning systems for the protection of surface waters. In
   the present paper, a novel approach is discussed, in which the unknown
   location and magnitude of pollution are looked through the solution of
   an inverse problem, based on the experimental detection of a
   contamination pattern and on a suitable mathematical model of the
   governing system. Provided that the geometry, the hydraulic parameters
   and the boundary conditions are sufficiently simple, the equations
   describing the conservation of contaminant mass can be solved formally.
   On the other hand, for more general conditions there is no alternative
   to the numerical solution. Benefits and drawback of these two
   alternatives are analyzed in the present paper for a hypothetical case
   study concerning the Volturno river reach, close to the city of Caserta
   in Southern Italy, schematized as a one-dimensional (1-D) steady uniform
   flow. Namely, the response to the contamination pattern is computed by
   both the exact solution based on the convolution of the pulse response
   and the finite difference Crank-Nicolson discretization of the governing
   equations. The comparison between the two approaches, provides
   interesting results in terms of effectiveness, computational complexity
   (central processing unit time) and model limitations, which may be of
   valuable help in the implementation of an identification network based
   on smart sensors.}},

Title = {{Platform as a service gateway for the Fog of Things}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{243-257}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT), one of the key research topics in recent
   years, together with concepts from Fog Computing, brings rapid
   advancements in Smart City, Monitoring Systems, industrial control,
   transportation and other fields. These applications require a
   reconfigurable sensor architecture that can span multiple scenarios,
   devices and use cases that allow storage, networking and computational
   resources to be efficiently used on the edge of the network. There are a
   number of platforms and gateway architectures that have been proposed to
   manage these components and enable application deployment. These
   approaches lack horizontal integration between multiple providers as
   well as higher order functionalities like load balancing and clustering.
   This is partly due to the strongly coupled nature of the deployed
   applications, a lack of abstraction of device communication layers as
   well as a lock-in for communication protocols. This limitation is a
   major obstacle for the development of a protocol agnostic application
   environment that allows for single application to be migrated and to
   work with multiple peripheral devices with varying protocols from
   different local gateways. This research looks at existing platforms and
   their shortcomings as well as proposes a messaging based modular gateway
   platform that enables clustering of gateways and the abstraction of
   peripheral communication protocol details. These novelties allow
   applications to send and receive messages regardless of their deployment
   location and destination device protocol, creating a more uniform
   development environment. Furthermore, it results in a more streamlined
   application development and testing while providing more efficient use
   of the gateway's resources. Our evaluation of a prototype for the system
   shows the need for the migration of resources and the QoS advantages of
   such a system. The examined use case scenarios show that clustering
   proves to be an advantage in certain use cases as well as presenting the
   deployment of a larger testing and control environment through the
   platform. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of a knowledge and innovative-based society and economy,
   smart and creative cities are attracting an increasing number of young
   people, most of them being gifted, very talented students and
   high-skilled workforce, with multiple competences. These young people
   are pro-active and they involve themselves on enhancing the progress of
   the community in which they are living. Many cities are facing a higher
   rate of brain drain, as a consequence of the quality of life and the low
   level of wages considering also a reduce level of acceptance and
   implementation of innovative solutions. In the last decades migration
   phenomenon had been amplified and there is an increased young people
   migration from emergent countries to the innovation driven countries,
   witch assure more financial stability and favourable conditions to
   contribute to both personal and professional development for its
   residents.
   Through an empiric research, we have identified the most important
   factors which contribute to the amplified migration among youths. We
   have also highlighted the motivational elements for returning to
   homeland, when the socio-economic situation is favourable. The paper
   includes also a set of recommendations that could create a proper
   framework to attract talented, skilled and creative youth, regardless

Abstract = {{This paper aims to develop a low-cost, high-performance and
   high-reliability computing system to process large-scale data using
   common data mining algorithms in the Internet of Things (IoT) computing
   environment. Considering the characteristics of IoT data processing,
   similar to mainstream high performance computing, we use a GPU (Graphics
   Processing Unit) cluster to achieve better IoT services. Firstly, we
   present an energy consumption calculation method (ECCM) based on WSNs.
   Then, using the CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) Programming
   model, we propose a Two-level Parallel Optimization Model (TLPOM) which
   exploits reasonable resource planning and common compiler optimization
   techniques to obtain the best blocks and threads configuration
   considering the resource constraints of each node. The key to this part
   is dynamic coupling Thread-Level Parallelism (TLP) and Instruction-Level
   Parallelism (ILP) to improve the performance of the algorithms without
   additional energy consumption. Finally, combining the ECCM and the
   TLPOM, we use the Reliable GPU Cluster Architecture (RGCA) to obtain a
   high-reliability computing system considering the nodes' diversity,
   algorithm characteristics, etc. The results show that the performance of
   the algorithms significantly increased by 34.1\%, 33.96\% and 24.07\%
   for Fermi, Kepler and Maxwell on average with TLPOM and the RGCA ensures
   that our IoT computing system provides low-cost and high-reliability
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have many applications, such as climate
   monitoring systems, fire detection, smart homes, and smart cities. It is
   expected that WSNs will be integrated into the Internet of Things
   (IoT)and participate in various tasks. WSNs play an important role
   monitoring and reporting environment information and collecting
   surrounding context. In this paper we consider a WSN deployed for an
   application such as environment monitoring, and a mobile sink which acts
   as the gateway between the Internet and the WSN. Data gathering is a
   challenging problem in WSNs and in the IoT because the information has
   to be available quickly and effectively without delays and redundancies.
   In this paper we propose several distributed algorithms for composite
   event detection and reporting to a mobile sink. Once data is collected
   by the sink, it can be shared using the IoT infrastructure. We analyze
   the performance of our algorithms using WSNet simulator, which is
   specially designed for event-based WSNs. We measure various metrics such
   as average residual energy, percentage of composite events processed
   successfully at the sink, and the average number of hops to reach the

Abstract = {{The smart city has become a popular topic of investigation. How to focus
   large amounts of distributed information resources to efficiently cope
   with public emergencies and provide support for personalized
   decision-making is a vitally important issue in the construction of
   smart cities. In this paper, an event-driven focusing service (EDFS)
   method that uses cyber-physical infrastructures for emergency response
   in smart cities is proposed. The method consists of a focusing service
   model at the top level, an informational representation of the model and
   a focusing service process to operate the service model in emergency
   response. The focusing service method follows an event-driven mechanism
   that allows the focusing service process to be triggered by public
   emergencies sensed by wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and mobile crowd
   sensing, and it integrates the requirements of different societal
   entities with regard to response to emergencies and information
   resources, thereby providing comprehensive and personalized support for
   decision-making. Furthermore, an EDFS prototype system is designed and
   implemented based on the proposed method. An experiment using a
   real-world scenariothe gas leakage in August 2014 in Taiyuan, Chinais
   presented demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method for
   assisting various societal entities in coping with and efficiently

Abstract = {{This study presents a model for district-level electricity demand
   forecasting using a set of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) (parallel
   ANNs) based on current energy loads and social parameters such as
   occupancy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is conducted to select
   the inputs of the ANN by considering external weather conditions,
   occupancy type, main income providers' employment status and related
   variables for the fuel poverty index. Moreover, a detailed parameter
   tuning is conducted using various configurations for each individual
   ANN. The study also demonstrates the strength of the parallel ANN models
   in different seasons of the years. In the proposed district level energy
   forecasting model, the training and testing stages of parallel ANNs
   utilise dataset of a group of six buildings. The aim of each individual
   ANN is to predict electricity consumption and the aggregated demand in
   sub-hourly time-steps. The inputs of each ANN are determined using
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Regression Analysis
   (MRA) methods. The accuracy and consistency of ANN predictions are
   evaluated using Pearson coefficient and average percentage error, and
   against four seasons: winter, spring, summer, and autumn. The lowest
   prediction error for the aggregated demand is about 4.51\% for winter
   season and the largest prediction error is found as 8.82\% for spring
   season. The results demonstrate that peak demand can be predicted
   successfully, and utilised to forecast and provide demand-side
   flexibility to the aggregators for effective management of district
   energy systems.}},

Abstract = {{Many cities and countries are now striving to create intelligent
   transportation systems that utilize the current abundance of multisource
   and multiform data related to the functionality and the use of
   transportation infrastructure to better support human mobility,
   interests, and lifestyles. Such intelligent transportation systems aim
   to provide novel services that can enable transportation consumers and
   managers to be better informed and make safer and more efficient use of
   the infrastructure. However, the transportation domain is characterized
   by both complex data and complex problems, which calls for visual
   analytics approaches. The science of visual analytics is continuing to
   develop principles, methods, and tools to enable synergistic work
   between humans and computers through interactive visual interfaces. Such
   interfaces support the unique capabilities of humans (such as the
   flexible application of prior knowledge and experiences, creative
   thinking, and insight) and couple these abilities with machines'
   computational strengths, enabling the generation of new knowledge from
   large and complex data. In this paper, we describe recent developments
   in visual analytics that are related to the study of movement and
   transportation systems and discuss how visual analytics can enable and
   improve the intelligent transportation systems of the future. We provide
   a survey of literature from the visual analytics domain and organize the
   survey with respect to the different types of transportation data,
   movement and its relationship to infrastructure and behavior, and
   modeling and planning. We conclude with lessons learned and future
   directions, including social transportation, recommender systems, and
   policy implications.}},

Abstract = {{We propose the TelcoFog architecture as a novel, secure, highly
   distributed, and ultra-dense fog computing infrastructure, which can be
   allocated at the extreme edge of a wired/wireless network for a telecom
   operator to provide multiple unified, cost-effective, and new 5G
   services, such as NFV, MEC, and services for third parties (e. g., smart
   cities, vertical industries, and IoT). The distributed and programmable
   fog technologies that are proposed in TelcoFog are expected to
   strengthen the position of the mobile network and cloud markets.
   TelcoFog, by design, is capable of integrating an ecosystem for network
   operators willing to provide NFV, MEC, and IoT services. TelcoFog's key
   benefits are the dynamic deployment of new distributed low-latency
   services. The novel TelcoFog architecture consists of three main
   building blocks: a scalable TelcoFog node, which is seamlessly
   integrated in the telecom infrastructure; a TelcoFog controller, focused
   on service assurance and based on service data modeling using YANG,
   which is integrated in the management and orchestration architecture of
   the telecom operator; and TelcoFog services, which are able to run on
   top of the TelcoFog and telecom infrastructure. The TelcoFog
   architecture is validated through a proof of concept for IoT services.}},

Abstract = {{An Internet of Things' (IoT) connected society and system represents a

   advanced analytics of electric smart meter (ESM) network
   communication-quality data to improve cost predictions for smart meter
   field operations and provide actionable decision recommendations
   regarding whether to send a technician to a customer location to resolve
   an ESM issue. The model is empirically evaluated using data sets from a
   commercial network. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach with a
   complete Bayesian network prediction model and compare with three
   machine learning prediction model classifiers: 1) Naive Bayes; 2) random
   forest; and 3) decision tree. Results demonstrate that our approach
   generates statistically noteworthy estimations and that the DSS will
   improve the cost efficiency of ESM network operations and maintenance.}},

Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: For a cloud-based telecardiology solution to be
   established in any scenario, it is necessary to ensure optimum levels of
   security, as patient's data will not be in the same place from where
   access is gained. The main objective of this article is to present a
   secure, cloud-based solution for a telecardiology service in different
   scenarios: a hospital, a health center in a city, and a group of health
   centers in a rural area.
   Methods: iCanCloud software is used to simulate the scenarios. The first
   scenario will be a city hospital with over 220,000 patients at its
   emergency services, and similar to 1 million outpatient consultations.
   For the health center in a city, it serves similar to 107,000 medical
   consultations and 16,700 pediatric consultations/year. In the last
   scenario, a group of health centers in a rural area serve an average
   437.08 consultations/month and around 15.6 a day.
   Results: Each one of the solutions proposed shares common features
   including the following: secure authentication through smart cards, the
   use of StorageGRID technology, and load balancers. For all cases, the
   cloud is private and the estimated price of the solution would cost
   around 450 e/month.
   Conclusions: Thanks to the research conducted in this work, it has been
   possible to provide an adapted solution in the form of a telecardiology
   service for a hospital, city health center, and rural health centers
   that offer security, privacy, and robustness, and is also optimum for a
   large number of cloud requests.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things is an emerging subject nowadays and the
   applications based on this concept have multiple practical issues that
   can be applied in many areas of our society: smart grid, building and
   home automation, automotive, health care or smart cities. The Internet
   of Things enabled applications will radically change the interactions
   between humans and the environment, thus security being a key-point of
   this ecosystem. One of the most important Internet of Things enabled
   scenarios is the smart city, this application having a direct impact on
   multiple social areas: smart lighting, smart roads, noise urban maps and
   many others. Smart city objects will interact with both humans and
   machines, implementing multiple communication protocols. Taking this
   into consideration, integrating smart city objects with social networks
   is a logical step, even though this idea implies multiple security
   issues and innovative big data processing systems. Social networks
   represent a platform where both machines and humans can exchange
   messages, being an information source and sink for the smart city
   objects. This paper presents a security architecture where social
   networks enable an adaptive sensing-as-a-service system. Smart city
   objects, which need additional information beside the one obtained from
   the sensors, collect it from the most trusted nodes on the social
   network. This system enables an autonomic computing mechanism where
   smart objects have a reputation built on the feedback received from both
   human and other nodes, a certain degree of trust being transferred to
   all the nodes which contributed to the publication of reliable
   information.}},

Title = {{Assessing energy performances: A step toward energy efficiency at the
   municipal level}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{57-69}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{At present, energy efficiency represents one of the foremost challenges
   to achieve the transition toward a low carbon society. Reducing energy
   use spans a broad range of technical issues and spatial scales: from
   building to districts, from cities to rural areas, and from energy power
   plants to electricity grids. In this frame, the challenge of enhancing
   energy efficiency can be understood as an extremely relevant topic for
   planning at the municipal level. Nevertheless, recent studies provide
   evidence that significant gaps exist in the enhancement of energy
   efficiency within municipal boundaries. The present research recognises
   that a comprehensive assessment of municipal energy performances is an
   essential starting point to facilitate local planning in enhancing
   energy efficiency. However, how can this challenge be translated into
   practice and applied to the implementation of local planning? As new
   models result from the transformation of existing ones, the development
   of a methodology associated with a case study in Portugal was deemed the
   most appropriate approach to contribute to knowledge in these fields.
   The primary objective of this study is to move toward more integrated
   process of planning for energy efficiency, supporting the definition of
   priorities and strategies to address energy saving improvements at
   municipal level. The assessment process involves a statistical analysis
   that using Geographical Information System, is combined and translated
   into spatial models to determine needs and set priorities within a
   Municipal Master Plan review. Based on this top-down approach, it
   becomes clear that energy efficiency is a cross-cutting issue
   interrelated with a blend of various disciplines: geography, spatial
   planning, urbanism, architecture, and civil engineering. The results
   enable us to understand why municipalities should be called upon to
   enhance energy efficiency by first looking at a comprehensive energy
   performance assessment. Embracing the whole municipal territory rather
   than only urban areas, is key to articulate energy efficiency and
   geographical, social, environmental and economic factors that are at the
   core of local planning.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{113-125}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recent literature on social innovation highlights its conceptual
   ambiguity and emphasizes how technology has contributed to the
   renovation of this 200 year old practice, calling for more
   sector-specific research. Addressing this call, this paper examines how
   social innovation fits in the urban sustainability discourse and in what
   way it empowers urban citizens and their communities towards serving
   their interests. The findings with respect to 29 cases of social
   innovation initiatives for environmental sustainability across 9 domains
   suggest that a large spectrum of sustainability challenges and topics
   are addressed by existing initiatives, which in turn can refer to
   different urban spatialities. For each initiative we examine the social
   innovation process, focusing on the types of involved organizations, the
   underlying innovation mechanisms as well as the use of technology. In
   terms of citizen empowerment, we examine the empowerment mode, the main
   beneficiaries of the innovation, as well as the specific outcome of the
   initiative. Following this analysis, we arrive to the identification and
   description of four primary citizen profiles in social innovation for
   sustainable urban development. We close by calling for further research
   into the perception, behavior and needs that are associated with the
   identified citizen profiles and their communities.}},

Abstract = {{High variability interchange times often significantly affect the
   reliability of metro travels. Fine-grained measurements of interchange
   times during metro transfers can provide valuable insights on the
   crowdedness of stations, usage of station facilities and efficiency of
   metro lines. Measuring interchange times in metro systems is challenging
   since agent operated systems like automatic fare collection systems only
   provide coarse-grained trip information and popular localization
   services like GPS are often inaccessible underground. In this paper, we
   propose a smartphone-based interchange time measuring method from the
   passengers' perspective. It leverages low-power sensors embedded in
   modem smart phones to record ambient contextual features, and utilizes a
   two-tier classifier to infer interchange states during a metro trip, and
   further distinguishes 10 fine-grained cases during interchanges.
   Experimental results within 6 months across over 14 subway lines in 3
   major cities demonstrate that our approach yields an overall interchange
   state inference F1-measurement of 91.0\% and an average time error of
   less than 2 min at an inference interval of 20 s, and an average
   accuracy of 89.3\% to distinguish the 10 fine-grained interchange cases.
   We also conducted a series of case studies using measurements collected
   from crowdsourced users during 3 months, which reveals findings
   previously unattainable without fine-grained interchange time
   measurements, such as portions of waiting time during interchange,
   interchange directions, usage of facilities (stairs/escalators/lifts),
   and the root causes of long interchange times. (C) 2017 Published by

Abstract = {{Ultra dense deployment of base stations is one of most significant
   features in smart city communication networks. Aiming at the large-scale
   wireless communication issue in smart city, we propose a distributed

   cooperative orthogonal frequency-division-multiple-access relay network.
   With the amplify-and-forward relay mode, all of the relays assist the
   information transmission simultaneously on orthogonal subcarriers.
   Considering the uncertainty of channel gains, first we aim at achieving
   the maximum utility subject to the constraints of outage probability
   threshold and power bound. Subsequently, the problem is transformed to a
   solvable convex optimization problem with determination constraints. The
   dual-decomposition method is applied to solve the formulated
   optimization problem. To reduce the information exchange of the whole
   system, we propose a computationally efficient distributed iteration
   algorithm. Numerical results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed

   compression for social security applications in smart cities}},

Abstract = {{Surveillance has become a fairly common practice with the global boom in
   ``smart cities{''}. How to efficiently store and manage the vast
   quantities of surveillance data is a persistent challenge in terms of
   analyzing social security problems. Developing data compression
   technology under the analytic requirements of surveillance data is the
   key to solving the storage problem. Criminal investigation demands the
   quality preservation of sensitive objects, typically pedestrians, human
   faces, vehicles, and license plates; however, the analytical value of
   surveillance data is rapidly lost as the compression ratio increases. In
   this paper, we propose a sensitive object-oriented regions of
   interest-based coding strategy for preserving the analytical value of
   surveillance data. In the proposed method, instead of generating a
   saliency map based on human visual perception, we consider saliency as a
   set of characteristics important for object detection and recognition.
   By making this modification, almost all sensitive objects necessary in a
   criminal investigation are assigned high saliency value rather than only
   one or two salient regions. Motions in the temporal domain are
   integrated to place emphasis on moving objects, namely moving sensitive
   objects, which then gain the highest saliency. Finally, a saliency-based
   rate control algorithm embedded in High Efficiency Video Coding is used
   to maintain the quality of sensitive objects in the encoded video under
   a fixed bitrate. Experiments were conducted on two analytical indexes:
   Feature similarity and object detection accuracy. The results showed
   that by achieving the same feature similarity and object detection
   accuracy, our method can save 20\% and 40\% bitrate over High Efficiency
   Video Coding, respectively, for the storage of big surveillance data.

Abstract = {{As a well-known field of big data applications, smart city takes
   advantage of massive data analysis to achieve efficient management and
   sustainable development in the current worldwide urbanization process.
   An important problem in smart city is how to discover frequent
   trajectory sequence pattern and cluster trajectory. To solve this
   problem, this paper proposes a cloud-based taxi trajectory pattern
   mining and trajectory clustering framework for smart city. Our work
   mainly includes (1) preprocessing raw Global Positioning System trace by
   calling the Baidu API Geocoding; (2) proposing a distributed trajectory
   pattern mining (DTPM) algorithm based on Spark; and (3) proposing a
   distributed trajectory clustering (DTC) algorithm based on Spark. The
   proposed DTPM algorithm and DTC algorithm can overcome the high
   input/output overhead and communication overhead by adopting in-memory
   computation. In addition, the proposed DTPM algorithm can avoid
   generating redundant local trajectory patterns to significantly improve
   the overall performance. The proposed DTC algorithm can enhance the
   performance of trajectory similarity computation by transforming the
   trajectory similarity calculation into AND and OR operators.
   Experimental results indicate that DTPM algorithm and DTC algorithm can
   significantly improve the overall performance and scalability of
   trajectory pattern mining and trajectory clustering on massive taxi
   trace data. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The growth in the data volume and number of evidential data from
   heterogeneous distributed systems in smart cities, such as cloud and fog
   computing systems and Internet-of-Things devices (e.g. IP-based CCTVs),
   has led to increased collection, processing and analysis times,
   potentially resulting in vulnerable persons (e.g. victims of terrorism
   incidents) being at risk. A process of Digital Forensic Data Reduction
   of source multimedia and forensic images has provided a method to reduce
   the collection time and volume of data. In this paper, a methodology of
   Digital Forensic Quick Analysis is outlined, which describes a method to
   review Digital Forensic Data Reduction subsets to pinpoint relevant
   evidence and intelligence from heterogeneous distributed systems in a
   timely manner. Applying the proposed methodology to real-world data from
   an Australian police agency highlighted the timeliness of the process,
   resulting in significant improvements in processing times in comparison
   with processing a full forensic image. The Quick Analysis methodology,
   combined with Digital Forensic Data Reduction, has potential to locate
   evidence and intelligence in a timely manner. Copyright (c) 2016 John

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous smart devices with embedded sensors are paving the way for
   mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) that enable users to communicate
   directly, thereby playing a key role in Smart City and Internet of
   Things applications. In such smart environments, people with smart
   devices (nodes) can freely self-organize and form self-configuring
   MANETs to send and forward data packets to a destination over multiple
   hops via intermediate nodes. However, the energy consumption during
   routing remains a challenge in such ensemble mobile environments due to
   the limited battery capacity of mobile devices. This challenging issue
   has received substantial research attention, necessitating an exhaustive
   literature search over the variety of academic fields addressing this
   topic. The main motivation of this paper is to review various
   power-efficient routing schemes in MANETs that have recently been
   proposed to reduce the energy consumed when transmitting and receiving
   packets during active communication. Accordingly, these protocols are
   classified into six categories: (1) link state-based, (2)
   source-initiated-based, (3) transmission power control-based, (4)
   load-balancing-based, (5) location-based and (6) multicast-based routing
   approaches. The review covers various state-of-the-art protocols for
   each category and highlights their operation concepts, design challenges
   and key features. In addition, the various protocols are compared with
   emphasis on the merits and drawbacks as well as the considered metrics
   of each scheme. Finally, we provide a conclusion and suggest potential
   directions for future research in the field.}},

Title = {{A survey on cyber attacks against nonlinear state estimation in power

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{52-64}},

Abstract = {{It is well-known that critical infrastructures would be targets for
   cyber attacks. In this paper, we focus on the power systems (i.e. smart
   grids) in ubiquitous cities, where every meter is linked to an
   information network through wireless networking. In a smart grid system,
   information from smart meters would be used to perform a state
   estimation in real time to maintain the stability of the system. A wrong
   estimation may lead to disastrous consequences (e.g. suspension of
   electricity supply or a big financial loss). Unfortunately, quite a
   number of recent results showed that attacks on this estimation process
   are feasible by manipulating readings of only a few meters. In this
   paper, we focus on nonlinear state estimation which is a more realistic
   model and widely employed in a real power grid environment. We category
   cyber attacks against nonlinear state estimation, and review the
   mechanisms behind. State-of-the-art security measures to detect these
   attacks are discussed via sensor protection. Hope that the community
   would be able to come up with a secure system architecture for
   ubiquitous cities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of mobile devices and wireless technologies,
   location based services (LBSs) are becoming popular in smart cities. Two
   important classes of LBSs are Nearest Neighbor (NN) queries and range
   queries that provide user information about the locations of point of
   interests (POIs) such as hospitals or restaurants. Answers of these
   queries are more reliable and satisfiable if they come from trustworthy
   crowd instead of traditional location service providers (LSPs). We
   introduce an approach to evaluate NN and range queries with crowdsourced
   data and computation that eliminates the role of an LSP. In our
   crowdsourced approach, a user evaluates LBSs in a group. It may happen
   that group members do not have knowledge of all POIs in a certain area.
   We present efficient algorithms to evaluate queries with accuracy
   guarantee in incomplete databases. Experiments show that our approach is
   scalable and incurs less computational overhead. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Cities are coming under increasing pressure to minimize energy use and
   greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, drinking water utilities must
   improve the efficiency of their management systems while guaranteeing a
   clean effluent that satisfies drinking water standards. One possible
   solution is via smart growth, an urban development paradigm with the
   goal of reducing the environmental impact of urbanization. Therefore,
   this study aims to determine the effect of smart growth on the
   operational energy of drinking water distribution. Projected water use
   in Tampa's drinking water service area was estimated based on several
   urban growth projections. Then, each scenario's associated projected
   water consumption is integrated in an EPANET simulation of Tampa's water
   distribution system for the subsequent estimation of the operational
   energies of drinking water distribution. Results show that smart growth
   has no exclusive influence on the operational energy of water supply.
   However, location of added demand relative to the location of the water
   treatment plant has more of an influence on the operational energy.
   Also, smart growth in the City of Tampa Water Service Area is
   responsible for a decrease in per-capita residential water and energy
   use of about 6-10\% and 0.5-6.2\% respectively. In conclusion, smart
   growth in areas near the water treatment facility may minimize
   water-related energy use.}},

Title = {{A co-location pattern-mining algorithm with a density-weighted distance
   thresholding consideration}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{396}},
Pages = {{144-161}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{With the rapid development of science technology, finding prevalent
   spatial patterns from urban facility data has gradually become an
   important issue in smart city applications. Co-location pattern alining
   is a valid method for identifying patterns whose instances are prevalent
   in geographical proximity. However, existing methods treat the space as
   homogeneous and non-directional, and both the proximity levels and
   connecting directions of instances are neglected during the mining
   process, causing the minded patterns to be unsatisfactory. Tobler's
   First Law indicates that the contributions of instances to their
   pattern's significance diminish as the distance decreases. Moreover, the
   directions in which instances are connected should also be considered
   due to the distance decay effects. Following these threads, this paper
   proposes a novel co-location pattern mining algorithm mixed with a
   density-weighted distance thresholding consideration. Based on the
   framework of our previous SGCT algorithm, which concentrates on
   efficiency and storage issues, this solution comprises an extension
   called SGCT-K, which is mainly concerned with improving the
   effectiveness of the mined results. It adopts a
   kernel-density-estimation-based model to measure the proximity level of
   different instance types and respects their directions during the
   instance connecting process. We implement experiments using both
   synthetic and real-facility datasets in Beijing, China. The results
   provide sound evidence that the algorithm improves both accuracy and
   sensitivity compared to previous methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The challenges that urbanisation pose is multi-faceted. Land allocation
   priorities to urban green cover are usually neglected or readily
   negotiated in the countries that are in transition. Urbanisation devoid
   of urban green can cause many social and physical impacts on its
   residents. Hence, locally suitable Green Index should be devised and
   incorporated in the urban planning of cities, in spite of the size of
   the city. This analysis is to showcase the green index for the planning
   of smart cities. The devised green index is verified in the real-world
   context of Gulbarga city, India, thereby understanding the practicality
   of this index. The results show scope for alternative green cover, where
   ever the green index is low. This technique presents intra-city green
   cover pattern analysis. Such analysis emphasises to reserve the space
   for green in urban planning for well-being in totality. The aspect of
   Land Surface Temperature (LST) analysis and correlating the same with
   the amount of green cover further enhances the process of promoting
   green cities. The assessment of per capita green space with the
   standards of World Health Organisation (WHO) identified the scope of
   greenery initiatives in various parts of the city.}},

Abstract = {{A location choice model explains how travellers choose their trip
   destinations especially for those activities which are flexible in space
   and time. The model is usually estimated using travel survey data;
   however, little is known about how to use smart card data (SCD) for this
   purpose in a public transport network. Our study extracted trip
   information from SCD to model location choice of after-work activities.
   We newly defined the metrics of travel impedance in this case. Moreover,
   since socio-demographic information is missing in such anonymous data,
   we used observable proxy indicators, including commuting distance and
   the characteristics of one's home and workplace stations, to capture
   some interpersonal heterogeneity. Such heterogeneity is expected to
   distinguish the population and better explain the difference of their
   location choice behaviour. The approach was applied to metro travellers
   in the city of Shanghai, China. As a result, the model performs well in
   explaining the choices. Our new metrics of travel impedance to access an
   after-work activity result in a better model fit than the existing
   metrics and add additional interpretability to the results. Moreover,
   the proxy variables distinguishing the population seem to influence the
   choice behaviour and thus improve the model performance.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) is one of the most actual and
   challenging research areas in automotive companies and ITS designers.
   The presence of such networks opens the way for a wide range of
   applications such as safety applications, mobility and connectivity for
   both driver and passengers to exploit the transport systems in a
   smoothly, efficiently and safer way. For safety applications the best
   routing protocol must be selected. The three most common routing
   protocols that are used in VANET are: DSR, AODV and DSDV. Indeed, it is
   important and essential to test and evaluate different routing protocols
   related to VANET system before applying them in the real environment
   which can be done via VANET simulation tools. This paper evaluates the
   performance of three different routing protocols for VANET system in
   city of Khartoum. The performance is evaluated and compared in terms of
   PDR, average throughput, delay and total energy. Our objective is to
   estimate the performance of routing model for city scenario. The main
   goal is to find the suitable routing protocol in a high density traffic
   area in Khartoum. We have considered three routing protocols DSR, AODV
   and DSDV. The results indicate the poor quality of DSDV protocol which
   is a type from proactive routing protocols. The AODV protocol achieves
   maximum average throughput which is equal to 330.07 Kbps. The minimum
   value of delay obtained from using DSR protocol was 15.81 ms. (C) 2017

   Retrofitting Scenarios}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, there is an increasing concern about sustainable urban energy
   development taking into account national priorities of each city. Many
   cities have started to define future strategies and plans to reduce
   energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Urban energy scenarios
   involve the consideration of a wide range of conflicting criteria, both
   socio-economic and environmental ones. Moreover, decision-makers (DMs)
   require proper tools that can support their choices in a context of
   multiple stakeholders and a long-term perspective. In this context,
   Multicriteria Spatial Decision Support Systems (MC-SDSS) are often used
   in order to define and analyze urban scenarios since they support the
   comparison of different solutions, based on a combination of multiple
   factors. The main problem, in relation to urban energy retrofitting
   scenarios, is the lack of appropriate knowledge and evaluation criteria.
   The latter are crucial for delivering and assessing urban energy
   scenarios through a MC-SDSS tool. The main goal of this paper is to
   analyze and test two different methods for the definition and ranking of
   the evaluation criteria. More specifically, the paper presents an
   on-going research study related to the development of a MC-SDSS tool
   able to identify and evaluate alternative energy urban scenarios in a
   long-term period perspective. This study refers to two Smart City and
   Communities research projects, namely: DIMMER (District Information
   Modeling and Management for Energy Reduction) and EEB (Zero Energy

   Free-Floating Carsharing Bookings: A Case-Study of German Cities}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{When the first free-floating carsharing operators launched their
   business, they did not know if it would be profitable. They often
   started in highly populated cities without performing extensive target
   group analysis, and were less concerned about fleet management. Usually,
   there are two main datasets that can be used to find areas that would
   have a high demand for free-floating carsharing: booking data, for
   measuring the actual demand; and land use and census data for describing
   the activities performed in different areas in a city. In this paper, we
   aim to use this information to help predict the demand of free-floating
   carsharing systems. We use booking data provided by DriveNow for Berlin
   in 2014 and contextual information about the type of activity each
   neighborhood has. Using Berlin as a case study, we apply a negative
   binomial statistical model to explain the number of bookings. From the
   results, we conclude that free-floating carsharing is predominantly
   successful in areas with more affluent citizens who are open to trying
   new and sustainable technologies. Other important determinants that
   result in a high number of carsharing bookings are the area's centrality
   and parking lot availability. The statistical model for Berlin was then
   transferred to Munich and Cologne, two other cities in Germany with
   similar population sizes. A comparison between the estimated demand
   categories and actual bookings shows satisfying results, but also
   non-negligible local conditions influencing the spatial demand for
   bookings.}},

Abstract = {{Urban sustainable development strategies are of great importance to
   rapidly urbanized countries such as China. One of the most challenging
   problems is how to coordinate urban spatial development with social
   efficiency and environmental protection, e.g., highly efficient
   low-carbon urban traffic. Despite broad research efforts with respect to
   the influence of urban form on travel patterns, questions persist as to
   the impact of compact urban form on travel distance and modes. In this
   study, we adopted urban form metrics to capture key dimensions of urban
   form with the aid of image processing and spatial analysis based on
   satellite images and statistical data from the cases of 35 cities.
   Combined with urban travel survey data, we empirically examined the
   relationships between urban form and travel patterns of local urban
   residents. The results showed that urban form and travel patterns have
   regionalized characteristics, e.g., the eastern cities are characterized
   by disperse urban development patterns and longer commuting times on
   average compared with western and central cities. We found that
   relatively smaller built-up areas, higher degrees of urban spatial
   agglomeration and more paved road area per person would decrease the
   commuting time of urban residents. We also found that the public
   transport choices of urban residents are positively associated with
   built-up areas and commuting times, which suggests the need for
   provision and promotion of facilities for a high-quality public
   transport system. The findings provide helpful suggestions for the
   planning of sustainable urban form and development of transportation.}},

Abstract = {{Internet and, in particular, computer networks have become a key issue
   in our daily lives, due to the birth of wireless technologies. Internet
   of Things (IoT) aims to integrate sensors and actuators in daily
   objects, maximizing miniaturization and minimizing the economic cost of
   these hardware components. The purpose is to connect these components to
   the Internet through wireless and fixed networks, and thereby produce
   information in real time which is then stored for later processing. On
   the other hand, Interactive TV (iTV) combines traditional TV with
   interactivity similar to that of the Internet and the personal computer.
   The evolution of TV technology has brought computing power to this
   device, offering services apart from the traditional ones, making it a
   device capable of running applications and maximizing its networking
   potential. This work presents a framework that includes and integrates a
   wireless sensor network, an IoT platform, and a real interactive TV
   application. It covers the deployment and communication of the wireless
   sensor network through the interoperability of data, to final
   consumption, through a real interactive television application. It has
   been tested within a residential community to provide real-time
   information, in order to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants.
   In addition, it incorporates the possibility of analyzing this
   information to establish processes with the objective of reducing energy
   consumption, thus improving sustainability and contributing to the
   efficient use of existing resources. The proposed framework serves as
   the basis for any deployment of similar characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Data processing for Smart Cities become more challenging, facing with
   different handling steps: data collection from different heterogeneous
   sources, processing sometimes in real-time and then delivered to high
   level services or applications used in Smart Cities. Applications used
   for intelligent transportation systems, crowd management, water
   resources management, noise and air pollution management, require
   different data processing techniques. The main subject of this paper is
   to propose an architecture for data processing in Smart Cities. The
   architecture is oriented on the flow of data from the source to the end
   user. We describe seven steps of data processing: collection of data
   from heterogeneous sources, data normalization, data brokering, data
   storage, data analysis, data visualization and decision support systems.
   We consider two case studies on crowd management in smart cities and on
   Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and we provide experimental
   highlights. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Optical Camera Communication System}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Due to the massive insertion of embedded cameras in a wide variety of
   devices and the generalized use of LED lamps, Optical Camera
   Communication (OCC) has been proposed as a practical solution for future
   Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities applications. Influence of
   mobility, weather conditions, solar radiation interference, and external
   light sources over Visible Light Communication (VLC) schemes have been
   addressed in previous works. Some authors have studied the spatial
   intersymbol interference from close emitters within an OCC system;
   however, it has not been characterized or measured in function of the
   different transmitted wavelengths. In this work, this interference has
   been experimentally characterized and the Normalized Power Signal to
   Interference Ratio (NPSIR) for easily determining the interference in
   other implementations, independently of the selected system devices, has
   been also proposed. A set of experiments in a darkroom, working with RGB
   multi-LED transmitters and a general purpose camera, were performed in
   order to obtain the NPSIR values and to validate the deduced equations
   for 2D pixel representation of real distances. These parameters were
   used in the simulation of a wireless sensor network scenario in a small
   office, where the Bit Error Rate (BER) of the communication link was
   calculated. The experiments show that the interference of other close
   emitters in terms of the distance and the used wavelength can be easily
   determined with the NPSIR. Finally, the simulation validates the
   applicability of the deduced equations for scaling the initial results
   into real scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) is a novel class of Internet of
   Things (IoT), and is defined as the network of smart interconnected
   underwater objects. IoUT is expected to enable various practical
   applications, such as environmental monitoring, underwater exploration,
   and disaster prevention. With these applications, IoUT is regarded as
   one of the potential technologies toward developing smart cities. To
   support the concept of IoUT, Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs)
   have emerged as a promising network system. UWSNs are different from the
   traditional Territorial Wireless Sensor Networks (TWSNs), and have
   several unique properties, such as long propagation delay, narrow
   bandwidth, and low reliability. These unique properties would be great
   challenges for IoUT. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study of
   IoUT, and the main contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) we
   introduce and classify the practical underwater applications that can
   highlight the importance of IoUT; (2) we point out the differences
   between UWSNs and traditional TWSNs, and these differences are the main
   challenges for IoUT; and (3) we investigate and evaluate the channel
   models, which are the technical core for designing reliable
   communication protocols on IoUT.}},

   combination of heterogeneous wireless network exhibits fundamental
   limitations derived from Coverage/Capacity relations, as a function of
   required Quality of Service parameters, required bit rate, energy
   restrictions and adaptive modulation and coding schemes. In this
   context, inherent transceiver density poses challenges in overall system
   operation, given by multiple node operation which increases overall
   interference levels. In this work, a deterministic based analysis
   applied to variable density wireless sensor network operation within
   complex indoor scenarios is presented, as a function of topological node
   distribution. The extensive analysis derives interference
   characterizations, both for conventional transceivers as well as
   wearables, which provide relevant information in terms of individual
   node configuration as well as complete network layout.}},

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous sensing allows smart cities to take control of many
   parameters (e.g., road traffic, air or noise pollution levels, etc.). An
   inexpensive Wireless Mesh Network can be used as an efficient way to
   transport sensed data. When that mesh is autonomously powered (e.g.,
   solar powered), it constitutes an ideal portable network system which
   can be deployed when needed. Nevertheless, its power consumption must be
   restrained to extend its operational cycle and for preserving the
   environment. To this end, our strategy fosters wireless interface
   deactivation among nodes which do not participate in any route. As we
   show, this contributes to a significant power saving for the mesh.
   Furthermore, our strategy is wireless-friendly, meaning that it gives
   priority to deactivation of nodes receiving (and also causing)
   interferences from (to) the rest of the smart city. We also show that a
   routing protocol can adapt to this strategy in which certain nodes
   deactivate their own wireless interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of 21st century, over last 16-18 years, there has been
   an exodus of people moving to urban towns and cities, a phenomenon
   observed globally. This makes the cities not only extremely congested,
   but also very polluted and resource-scarce. With 50+ new cities and 100+
   smart cities set to come up in South East Asia by 2030, it is extremely
   essential to plan the development of a city in such a way so as to be
   sustainable, accessible and eco-friendly. This paper presents a detailed
   survey and analysis of how the development of a city, particularly in
   India can be planned in the context of sustainable urban transformation,
   climate change and future urban vision. A detailed survey is provided on
   all three mentioned aspects by providing a comparison on different
   aspects with planned developments carried out globally. Further, the
   suitability of the existing solutions are analysed; along with a
   proposal on how to develop new cities. Finally, the paper addresses some
   of the challenges that need to be addressed in order to develop new
   sustainable, accessible, well-connected cities of future. (C) 2017

Title = {{ICT of the new wave of computing for sustainable urban forms: Their big
   data and context-aware augmented typologies and design concepts}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{449-474}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Undoubtedly, sustainable development has inspired a generation of
   scholars and practitioners in different disciplines into a quest for the
   immense opportunities created by the development of sustainable urban
   forms for human settlements that will enable built environments to
   function in a more constructive and efficient way. However, there are
   still significant challenges that need to be addressed and overcome. The
   issue of such forms has been problematic and difficult to deal with,
   particularly in relation to the evaluation and improvement of their
   contribution to the goals of sustainable development. As it is an urban
   world where the informational and physical landscapes are increasingly
   being merged, sustainable urban forms need to embrace and leverage what
   current and future ICT has to offer as innovative solutions and
   sophisticated methods so as to thrive-i.e. advance their contribution to
   sustainability. The need for ICT of the new wave of computing to be
   embedded in such forms is underpinned by the recognition that urban
   sustainability applications are deemed of high relevance to the
   contemporary research agenda of computing and ICT. To unlock and exploit
   the underlying potential, the field of sustainable urban planning is
   required to extend its boundaries and broaden its horizons beyond the
   ambit of the built form of cities to include technological innovation
   opportunities. This paper explores and substantiates the real potential
   of ICT of the new wave of computing to evaluate and improve the
   contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable
   development. This entails merging big data and contextaware technologies
   and their applications with the typologies and design concepts of
   sustainable urban forms to achieve multiple hitherto unrealized goals.
   In doing so, this paper identifies models of smart sustainable city and
   their technologies and applications and models of sustainable urban form
   and their design concepts and typologies. In addition, it addresses the
   question of how these technologies and applications can be amalgamated
   with these design concepts and typologies in ways that ultimately
   evaluate and improve the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the
   goals of sustainable development. The overall aim of this paper suits a
   mix of three methodologies: literature review, thematic analysis, and
   secondary ( qualitative) data analysis to achieve different but related
   objectives. The study identifies four technologies and two classes of
   applications pertaining to models of smart sustainable city as well as
   three design concepts and four typologies related to models of
   sustainable urban form. Finally, this paper proposes a Matrix to help
   scholars and planners in understanding and analyzing how and to what
   extent the contribution of sustainable urban forms to sustainability can
   be improved through ICT of the new wave of computing as to the
   underlying novel technologies and their applications, as well as a
   data-centric approach into investigating and evaluating this
   contribution and a simulation method for strategically optimizing it.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we show how a simple model based on chemical signaling can
   reduce the exploration times in urban environments. The problem is
   relevant for smart city navigation where electric vehicles try to find
   recharging stations with unknown locations. To this end we have adapted
   the classical ant foraging swarm algorithm to urban morphologies. A
   perturbed Markov chain model is shown to qualitatively reproduce the
   observed behaviour. This consists of perturbing the lattice random walk
   with a set of perturbing sources. As the number of sources increases the
   exploration times decrease consistently with the swarm algorithm. This
   model provides a better understanding of underlying process dynamics. An
   experimental campaign with real prototypes provided experimental
   validation of our models. This enables us to extrapolate conclusions to
   optimize electric vehicle routing in real city topologies.}},

Title = {{Understanding the Impact of Urbanization on Surface Urban Heat Islands-A
   Longitudinal Analysis of the Oasis Effect in Subtropical Desert Cities}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We quantified the spatio-temporal patterns of land cover/land use (LCLU)
   change to document and evaluate the daytime surface urban heat island
   (SUHI) for five hot subtropical desert cities (Beer Sheva, Israel;
   Hotan, China; Jodhpur, India; Kharga, Egypt; and Las Vegas, NV, USA).
   Sequential Landsat images were acquired and classified into the USGS
   24-category Land Use Categories using object-based image analysis with
   an overall accuracy of 80\% to 95.5\%. We estimated the land surface
   temperature (LST) of all available Landsat data from June to August for
   years 1990, 2000, and 2010 and computed the urban-rural difference in
   the average LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for
   each city. Leveraging non-parametric statistical analysis, we also
   investigated the impacts of city size and population on the urban-rural
   difference in the summer daytime LST and NDVI. Urban expansion is
   observed for all five cities, but the urbanization pattern varies widely
   from city to city. A negative SUHI effect or an oasis effect exists for
   all the cities across all three years, and the amplitude of the oasis
   effect tends to increase as the urban-rural NDVI difference increases. A
   strong oasis effect is observed for Hotan and Kharga with evidently
   larger NDVI difference than the other cities. Larger cities tend to have
   a weaker cooling effect while a negative association is identified
   between NDVI difference and population. Understanding the daytime oasis
   effect of desert cities is vital for sustainable urban planning and the
   design of adaptive management, providing valuable guidelines to foster
   smart desert cities in an era of climate variability, uncertainty, and
   change.}},

Title = {{Achieving energy savings by intelligent transportation systems

Abstract = {{Investments in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are beginning to
   take place in the context of smart city initiatives in many cities.
   Energy efficiency and emissions reduction are becoming essential
   rationales for such investments. It is important, therefore, to
   understand under what conditions investments in ITS in the context of
   smart cities produce energy savings. We reviewed existing literature,
   conducted case studies and interviews, and found that the smart cities
   context has transformed traditional ITS into ``smart mobility{''} with
   three major characteristics: people-centric, data-driven, and powered by
   bottom up innovations.
   We argue that there are four main steps for smart mobility solutions to
   achieve energy savings and that several institutional, technical, and
   physical conditions are required at each step. Energy savings are
   achieved when users change their behavior and result in less travel,
   modal shift, and reduction of per-km energy consumption in the short
   term. Smart mobility solutions also enable other energy saving policies
   or initiatives, which would otherwise not be feasible. In the long term,
   users' lifestyles could change and lead to further energy savings.
   For cities in developing countries with lower motorization,
   less-developed infrastructure, less financial resources, and less
   institutional and technical capacity, our recommendations to achieve
   benefits from smart mobility investments are: (1) involve all public and
   private players in a collaborative and transparent setting; (2) develop
   the technical capacity to procure and monitor information services; and
   (3) focus on basic infrastructure, including a coherent road network and
   basic traffic management measures. (C) 2017 The World Bank. Published by

Abstract = {{Globally today, Living in urban areas is more preferred than in living
   rural areas. This situation creates many problem for urban living. One
   of the big problem is waste management in urban areas. Optimizing waste
   collection has become very important phenomenon for being smart city. In
   this study, we aimed to optimize waste collection for reduce both cost
   of collection and pollution effect of environment. We designed a garbage
   container integrated sensors for measuring fill level of container,
   temperature, and ratio of carbon dioxide inside the container. We
   transmitted all information to our waste management software based
   Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. According to the ant colony
   algorithm, most efficient waste collection route delivered to garbage
   truck drivers' cellular enabled smart tablet. We used data mining
   approach to forecast when garbage container can reach highest level, and
   the planning of garbage container placement. We applied this smart waste
   collection management system in a town where is in Kayseri, Turkey. In
   first step, we applied for 200 Items (garbage containers) in the town
   that has 548.028 population and urban living ratio is 100\%. Before
   smart waste management system 200 garbage containers was collecting by
   garbage trucks in a static route. After we had applied smart waste
   management system, containers were collected by garbage truck in dynamic
   route. Smart waste management system significantly decreased the trucks'
   oil cost, carbon emissions, traffic, truck wear, noise pollution,
   environmental pollution, and work hours. The system presented
   approximately 30\% with in direct cost savings in waste collection.}},

Abstract = {{Noise pollution can significantly limit the growth of the communities
   located nearby an airport. Pisa International Airport has recently
   presented its action plan, which includes both the construction of a
   runway link that increases the take-off run length and the introduction
   of the ICAO-A noise-abatement procedure. Nevertheless, the airport still
   needs to develop new strategies to ensure an effective noise reduction
   as a response to the growing aircraft traffic. This paper shows an
   innovative approach for managing airport noise on the closest urban
   areas based on the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)
   technology. ADS-B output data were used to track the flight departures
   with high data resolution and then to verify both the effectiveness of
   the action plan and the compliance with its provisions. A penetration
   gate was strategically set considering the departures towards the city.
   The vertical distribution of the traffic crossing the gate and the
   correlation between take-off conditions and noise-related events were
   investigated in order to establish rules for penalties due to the lack
   of compliance with the action plan requirements. The results confirmed
   that ADS-B system could be considered a smart tool producing
   cost-effective solutions for the airport noise management in urban
   areas, particularly when the radar tracks are not available.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental pollution monitoring is a major concern in the development
   of smart cities. Nowadays, urban noise is one of the most relevant
   pollutants, so many networks of acoustic sensors have been deployed to
   measure sound pressure levels at various locations. These acoustic
   sensors collect huge amounts of data, which can be helpful to manage
   noise events in urban planning. In this paper, a big data framework is
   proposed to properly analyse the considerably large amounts of noise
   monitoring data and obtain useful information for urban planning. A map
   and reduce approach is proposed to process the massive data captured
   from acoustic sensor networks, mobile phones and open data platforms.
   Using the map and reduce model, several statistical environmental
   acoustic parameters, including both temporal and spatial indices, can be
   calculated. As an example application, two algorithms are implemented to
   evaluate both day-evening-night equivalent levels (L-den) and percentile
   levels (L-n). An experimental case with data obtained from the Dublin
   open data platform shows the benefits of this framework for urban noise
   analysis and management.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of transportation and the environment in the same
   strategy creates numerous advantages for local governments, which is
   probably the reason why the enhancement of city bus services is one of
   the most recommended action plans to reduce urban traffic noise. The
   major potential of smart solutions for public transportation lies in
   providing much of these enhancement options through technology, not only
   via traditional techniques such as systematically extending the road
   infrastructure. Unfortunately, many of these solutions need to be
   carefully analyzed before their application to a real case, among other
   reasons because of the possibility of creating unintended side effects.
   In this study, we make use of `ad-hoe' Bus Signal Priority (BSP)
   strategies, designed to be applied to a transit corridor to achieve the
   best compromise between the efficiency and attractiveness of the bus
   service. VISSIM microscopic traffic flow simulation is used first as a
   platform to test the proposed strategies through the indirect estimation
   of the space/time behavior of the noise emissions along the traffic
   network. Buses travel times are also estimated, as punctuality in the
   service is the precondition for the introduction of any other measure
   aimed at persuading drivers to leave their cars at home.}},

   paper explains the development of an online interactive tool that
   combines the use of IVR with maps. The tool can be used for the
   evaluation and monitoring of the spatial changes in the environmental
   noise appraisals of different areas of the city for future design
   processes, and will allow to involve a higher number of participants in
   comparison with laboratory experiments. It is aimed at becoming a
   collective participatory tool that uses spatial audio and virtual
   scenarios for a smart soundscape study, with the unique condition that
   the users have a smartphone and an IVR phone based headset, or the head
   mounted display Oculus Rift. A preliminary implementation of this tool
   has been tested in the Naples, using 360 degrees-video based Immersive
   Reality and in situ sound registrations with the Ambisonic technique.
   The outcomes on the citizens' participation are shown through coloured
   maps. Laboratory test in the anechoic chamber and on-site interviews
   have been conducted to compare the results with the ones of the home

Abstract = {{The concept of urban sustainability and liveability closely depends on
   multi-level approaches to environmental issues. The ultimate goal in the
   field of noise management is to involve citizens and facilitate their
   participation in urban environmental decisions. The SENSEable Pisa
   project, based on the concept of RealTime City and Smart City, presents
   an acoustic urban monitoring system based on a low-cost data acquisition
   method for a pervasive outdoor noise measurement. The system is based on
   the use of noise sensors located on private houses in the center of
   Pisa, which provide a good model for the current acoustic climate of
   Mediterranean city centers. In this study, SENSEable acquisitions show a
   strong anthropogenic component not revealed by public strategic maps.
   The anthropogenic component, commonly known as movida, becomes
   increasingly critical in Mediterranean cities, therefore, it is
   necessary to explore methods highlighting this new source and to adopt
   strategies for the creation of reliable noise pollution maps.}},

   KGC. Then we propose a strongly secure certificateless signature scheme,
   and give the secure proof in standard model. Compared with Pang et al.'s

Abstract = {{The promise of smart city leads to store massive sensitive IoT data in
   cloud storage from various sources. Storage burden and security concerns
   are the most challenging issues. Message-Locked Encryption (MLE) and
   Proof of Storage (PoS) are useful tools to solve these problems. MLE
   encrypts data meanwhile enabling deduplication on them to save storage,
   and PoS checks data integrity in case of any data corruptions. However,
   trivial combination of PoS with MLE results in additional metadata which
   contradicts with the aim of deduplication. Therefore, how to integrate
   PoS with MLE for IoT data is an interesting research problem. To solve
   this problem, we propose a block-level message-locked encryption scheme
   with polynomial commitment for IoT data, called BL-MLE-PC. We introduce
   a unique set of metadata called Quadruple Tags (QTs) which can serve as:
   block identifiers, PoW tags, PoS tags and decryption keys. In addition,
   we use polynomial commitment to obtain fast and efficient data auditing.
   Our scheme can deduplicate under block-level for fine-grained saving. We
   prove that our scheme is secure under predefined security models. The
   analysis shows our scheme is efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud-assisted applications have been developed in recent years,
   especially in servicing the smart city. Cloud computing is an emerging
   technology, which combines many redundant and distributed servers to
   provide various applications and services. On the one hand, the users
   can outsource their data to the cloud and enjoy the services that are
   provided by the cloud anytime and anywhere. On the other hand,
   outsourcing the data to the cloud will reduce the local storage burden
   and alleviate the hardware maintenance. However, the cloud server is
   semi-trusted, which possibly threaten the data's security. In addition,
   because the data owner will not physically possess the data after
   outsourcing the data to the cloud, it is required to check the storage
   correctness and data integrity. Cloud auditing protocols are proposed to
   solve this problem, but the efficiency and security of previous
   protocols are not well. In this paper, we proposed an enhanced auditing
   protocol, which can reduce the verification cost greatly and offer
   enough security assurance. Besides, our protocol is able to resist the
   forgery attack in the proof verification. The security and performance
   analysis shows that the proposed protocol can efficiently support
   storage verification and privacy preserving.}},

Title = {{Optimizing LWE-based FHE for Better Security and Privacy Protection of
   Smart City}},

Abstract = {{As a hot information technique, cloud computing is an excellent choice
   for building a ``smart city{''}. But cloud computing couldn't well
   balance convenience and privacy. This greatly influences its advantage
   to play. With the appearance of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), it
   is possible for cloud computing to be consistent with privacy. But, the
   efficiency of FHE schemes is still far from the actual needs. The main
   reason is the additional noise reduction manipulations which take lots
   of time.
   Up to now, the effective FHE schemes are mostly constructed based on the
   learning with error (LWE), and re-linearization technique is an
   essential technique to construct LWE-based FHE scheme. Meanwhile it is
   also the main cause of the noise expansion, which greatly affects the
   efficiency of LWE-based FHE, although binary decomposition is used to
   reduce the noise effectively by publishing the ``encryptions{''} of key
   components.
   In this paper, we are the first to directly study how to further reduce
   the noise (caused by the ``relinearization{''} technique) in a natural
   way. First, we verify that, according to original processing method of
   ``relinearization{''} technique, the binary is optimal in performance on
   noise reduction, compared to other scale numbers. Then we propose a new
   way to use multi-band decomposition for noise reduction. If we choose a
   quaternary representation as our way, noise can be reduced to about half
   of the original ``relinearization{''} technique for one homomorphic
   multiplication, which means less additional noise reduction
   manipulations needed for same depth of homomorphic evaluation circuit.
   Moreover, the larger the number of scale number we choose, the better
   the performance. Besides, we present an algorithm changing a somewhat
   LWE-based FHB into a leveled LWE-based FHE based on our optimized
   ``relinearization{''} technique.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of smart city, user data are all transformed in
   encrypted form to protect user privacy. Secure comparison in encrypted
   form is the fundamental operation of many secure encrypted data analysis
   tasks, such as secure k-NN query and classification, Bayesian
   classification. Thus, it is important to achieve an efficient secure
   encrypted data comparison scheme. Recently, some methods have been put
   forward to support secure comparison over encrypted data. Nevertheless,
   the existing solutions are still inefficient in practical. In this
   paper, we propose a novel encrypted data comparison protocol based on a
   hybrid approach of Paillier cryptosystem and garbled circuits. Our
   scheme reveals nothing about encrypted data and comparison result, and
   is provably secure under semi-honest model. Additionally, our proposed
   protocol can achieve higher efficiency, compared with the
   state-of-the-art scheme. Finally, we indicate the security and
   efficiency of our scheme by theoretical analysis and experiment
   evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of smart city, location-based services (LBS
   for short) have become an important part of intelligent transportation
   which is the basic infrastructure of smart city. However, when users
   enjoy LBS, they have to send their real time location to location
   service provider, which allows users to face the risk of release
   location privacy at any time. In order to protect the location privacy,
   a privacy protection model based digital envelope and dummies is
   proposed. We use distributed peer to peer structure, which does not
   require the third-part anonymous server, to improve the efficiency of
   the location communication and set different location privacy protection
   methods for single point query and track query in order to adapt the
   diversity for different environment of location privacy protection. With
   the combination of digital envelope and false location technology, we
   add noise to basic location information to improve the security of
   location data. The experiments results showed that the proposed scheme
   is efficient, and that the location privacy can be also protected.}},

Abstract = {{In the building of smart city, mobile Ad hoc network (MANET) has shown
   tremendous application potential because of its flexibility,
   distributivity, on-demand and self organization. High-speed mobility and
   heavy-load traffic in MANET may lead to the existence of frequently
   interrupted flows and prematurely drained energy, which degrades the
   performance of routing protocols. In this paper, a novel routing
   algorithm called as power controlled and stability-based routing
   protocol (PCSR) is proposed, aiming to improve the energy efficiency and
   route stability. In PCSR, a local connectivity table is firstly
   constructed at MAC layer without extra control packets, which is
   utilized to decide stable forwarding path at network layer. In addition,
   for the purpose of saving energy, the power for transmitting both
   control packets and datagrams is reduced in PCSR. Extensive simulations
   demonstrate that compared with existing routing protocols, our proposed
   PCSR consumes less energy and prolongs network lifetime with guaranteed
   packet delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Smart city is an urban development vision to integrate multiple
   information and communication technology (ICT) solutions in a secure
   fashion to manage a city's assets. It includes E-home, E-office,
   E-health, E-traffic and so on. All of these depend on the data
   collecting from multifarious devices and the following data processing
   and analyzing. So, communication between various devices (such as
   smartphone and so on) will be very frequent. In such an environment, the
   trust relationship between devices will be an important premise to
   guarantee an interaction can be carried on successfully. In this paper,
   we propose an attribute-based trust negotiation scheme for communication
   between devices (D2D communication) in a smart city. In this paper, we
   modeled the trust negotiation process as a 0/1 knapsack problem. We
   adopt the secure two-party computation technique based on the
   homomorphic encryption to guarantee its security. The proposed protocol
   can make sure that a device satisfies its counterparty's access policy
   while disclosing minimal privacy due to the credential disclosing. The
   theoretical analysis shows that our protocol is complete and secure in
   the semi-honest environment. Furthermore, there is no disclosure of
   credentials before both participants can ensure a success negotiation
   strategy exists. Moreover, devices cannot obtain the policies of their
   counterparty in the negotiation process. Finally, we did some
   simulations to analyze the computation cost of our protocol under
   different credential scales and resource access thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{Water controlling systems are important components of smart cities. As a
   system of Internet of Things, water controlling systems increasingly
   rely on many heterogeneous perception sensors, transportation tools, and
   application platforms for providing throughout services. In such
   environments, dynamic intrusion identification is of crucial to meet
   security goals and take measures on important nodes considering
   resources for quality assurance limited by time and by cost. In this
   paper, we introduce a Bayesian network model for intrusion
   identification in IoT and propose an importance index to identify
   important nodes for further security management when intrusion occurs.
   An experiment is carried out to illustrate how this model works. After
   formalizing a Bayesian network on a water controlling system, Bayesian
   inference can be performed based on conditional probability tables of
   nodes with parents and prior probabilities without parents, which can be
   acquired statistically based on historical data. This model has good
   potential applications on Internet of things due to its great capability
   of coping with thousands of sensors, tools, and platforms with Bayesian
   inference, and ability of dynamically identifying important nodes to
   improve the efficiency of security management.}},

Abstract = {{Smart city is an emerging research field nowadays, with emphasis of
   using big data to enhance citizens' quality of life. One of the
   prevalent smart city projects is to use big traffic data collected from
   road users over time, for road planning, traffic light scheduling,
   traffic jam relief, and public security. In particular, being able to
   know a road user's current location and predict his/her next move is
   important in today's intelligent transportation systems. Trajectory
   prediction has become a prudential research study direction, by which
   many algorithms have been published before. In this paper, we present a
   simple probabilistic model which predicts road users' next locations
   based on the ``concept of segments{''} abstracted from historical trails
   which the users have taken and accumulated over time in some data
   archive. Given a trajectory and a current location, the road user's next
   move in terms of road direction can be predicted at the junction. It is
   found that each road user would have his/her unique travel pattern
   hidden in the aggregate big traffic data. These patterns could be
   modeled from connected segments for simplicity. With the longer the
   trail and more frequently this trail was travelled, the more accurate
   that the next turn can be predicted. Simulation experiment was conducted
   based on summing up the segments from empirical trajectory data that was
   used in trajectory data mining by Microsoft. The results of our
   alternative model in contrast to the state of the arts demonstrated good
   efficacy.}},

Title = {{Disarming charisma? Mayoralty, gender and power in Medellin, Colombia}},
Journal = {{POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{126-135}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The `Urban Century' has seen a rise in power of cities, and the
   emergence of city mayors as significant political actors both nationally
   and globally. The power of city mayors, which unifies pragmatic,
   technomanagerial leadership with the authority and legitimacy of public
   office, invites a reappraisal of the gendered construction of power in
   the `Urban Century', and the particular notions of hegemonic masculinity
   that city mayors recreate. This article explores the example of
   Medellin, Colombia, whose mayor Sergio Fajardo is widely regarded to
   have stewarded the city's rapid reduction in violence. Fajardo's
   leadership can be characterised as typical of the phenomenon of smart,
   cosmopolitan, charismatic mayors who are seen to respond professionally
   to local needs by making smart investment decisions and attracting
   international capital. The emergence of a techno-managerial mayor in the
   city of Medellin, which during the 1990s was the epicentre of Colombia's
   multi-faceted conflict with the highest homicide rate in the world,
   represents a fundamental change to the identity and gender of power in a
   context of violent conflict where legitimate authority in terms of a
   monopoly on the use of force, was fiercely disputed. I use this example
   to explore how mayoral power is gendered and how it relates to violence,
   which is central to liberal theories of leadership and the focus of the
   feminist critique of them. The possibility that such a character attain
   power indicates underlying changes in the gendered structure of
   political space, including the institution of a Sub-Secretariat for
   Women and formalisation of participation in political process. (C) 2017

   participatory tools}},
Journal = {{CITIES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{21-30}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The abundance of online public participation tools has made it difficult
   for planning organizations to decide which tool will best meet their
   needs. Understanding the benefits or challenges of specific tools,
   facilitation requirements, or how individual tools may best advance the
   public participation aims is not always easy. This article builds on
   theories of planning, organizations, and information science to discuss
   various factors that cities and planning organizations should consider
   in deciding whether and how they should choose online participatory
   tools. While the technical capability of online technologies in
   facilitating participation and decision making should be examined, the
   capability of planning organizations and communities in adopting these
   technologies should be considered as well. This article argues that
   planning organizations should choose a participation platform based on
   the capacities of their organization, the characteristics of the
   communities that are going to use the tool, user-community norms and
   rules, and the tool's capabilities.}},

Journal = {{CITIES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{43-52}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Smart city approaches in city planning have gained significant momentum
   in the recent past. While proponents argue that smart cities will bring
   positive social change by the adoption of ICTs, enriched governance and
   human capital among the citizenry, opponents point out about the
   negative effects and gaps exist in their planning and execution. Despite
   efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the
   concept and the way it has been adopted and implemented. The roles of
   various players, especially the central role of the private sector, is
   often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations
   from various stakeholders make the potential implementation strategies
   even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field
   to date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning,
   which limit our knowledge about the `real' smart city and its
   implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such
   uncertainty at the conceptual level, and the heightened importance given
   by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights the need for
   proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the
   building of smart cities and, thereby, proposes a 3RC framework,
   consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical
   schools, which critically analyses various stages in the development of
   the field. The overall aim of the paper is to understand how smart
   cities differ in their meanings, intentions and `offerings'.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the drastic growth and an upsurge in the wireless communication
   devices in the world in recent years, there is a high demand of
   uninterrupted and intelligent connectivity in a self-organising manner
   amongst the users. It becomes more challenging for the emerging users
   because of scarcity of bandwidth. To overcome the unforbidden challenges
   in the advanced technologies like smart cities, 5G and Internet of
   Things (IoT), Cognitive Radio provides the solution to achieve high
   throughput and continuous connectivity for reliable communication. A
   primary challenge in the Cognitive Radio (CR) technology is the
   identification of dependable Data Channels (DCHs) for Secondary Users
   (SUs) communication amongst the available channels, and the continuation
   of communication when the Primary Users (PUs) return. The objective of
   every SU is to intelligently choose reliable DCHs, thereby ensuring
   reliable connectivity and successful transfer of data frames across the
   cognitive networks. The proposed Reliable, Intelligent and Smart
   Cognitive Radio protocol consumes less computational time and transmits
   energy with high throughput, as compared to the benchmark Cognitive
   Radio MAC (CR-MAC) protocols. This paper provides new applications of CR
   technology for IoT and proposes new and effective solutions to the real
   challenges in CR technology that will make IoT more affordable and

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{A global WLAN standard which utilizes country specific carrier
   frequencies below 1 GHz has been drafted by the IEEE 802.11ah (.ah) Task
   Group. This draft is highly useful in rural areas due to an improved
   wireless propagation characteristic and a large coverage. However, the
   .ah draft still adopts the CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with
   Collision Avoidance) as its media access and collision resolution
   protocol, which is energy consuming and not suitable for networks where
   STAs (STAtions) are generally battery supplied such as meters in a SG
   (Smart-Grid) network, one of the typical usecases of Internet of Energy
   in the .ah draft. In addition, since .ah could support up to at most
   6000 STAs to be scheduled within one BSS, the introduced overheads and
   corresponding processing delay are non-trivial and need more
   considerations. In this paper, a power saving scheduling scheme is
   proposed which could greatly reduce the introduced overhead while
   successfully scheduling the uplink/downlink traffics of meters in the
   Internet of Energy. Considering the service model and special characters
   of .ah networks, our model could also extend the STAs battery life with
   best efforts thus making our protocol specifically suitable for SG
   networks where battery changing for a device is usually very difficult.
   Further, to make our model work well, a dynamic AID allocation scheme is
   also presented by which the AIDs of STAs are assigned according to the
   average service duration thus making those scheduled STAs with similar
   service characteristics occupy successive AIDs. In this way, the
   compressed Bitmap scheme proposed in our Power Saving polling scheme for
   SG in the Internet of Energy (PSSG), could greatly reduce the
   communication overheads. Numerical results show that our scheme is
   better than the Power Saving Mechanism (PSM) and Power Save Multi-Poll
   (PSMP) protocols in terms of overheads, throughput, average awaken time
   and energy consumptions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the role of networked microgrids as distributed
   systems for enhancing the power system resilience against extreme
   events. Resilience is an intrinsically complex property which requires
   deep understanding of microgrid operation in order to respond
   effectively in emergency conditions. The paper first introduces the
   definition and offers a generic framework for analyzing the power system
   resilience. The notion that large power systems can achieve a higher
   level of resilience through the deployment of networked microgrids is
   discussed in detail. In particular, the management of networked
   microgrids for riding through extreme events is analyzed. In addition,
   the merits of advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs)
   in microgrid-based distributed systems that can support the power system
   resilience are presented. The paper also points out the challenges for
   expanding the role of distributed systems and concludes that networked
   microgrids in particular provide a universal solution for improving the
   resilience against extreme events in Smart Cities.}},

Title = {{Winning the SDG battle in cities: how an integrated information

Abstract = {{In 2015, the United Nations adopted an ambitious development agenda
   composed of 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs), which are to be
   reached by 2030. Beyond SDG 11 concerning the development of sustainable
   cities, many of the SDGs target activities falling within the
   responsibility of local governments. Thus, cities will play a leading
   role in the achievement of these goals, and we argue that the
   information systems (IS) community must be an active partner in these
   efforts. This paper aims to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs by
   developing a conceptual model to explain the role of IS in building
   smart sustainable cities and providing a framework of action for IS
   researchers and city managers. To this end, we conduct grounded theory
   studies of two green IS used by an internationally recognized smart city
   to manage water quality and green space. Based on these findings, we
   articulate a model explaining how an integrated information ecosystem
   enables the interactions between three interrelated spheres -
   administrative, political and sustainability - to support the
   development of smart sustainable cities. Moving from theory to practice,
   we use two real-world scenarios to demonstrate the applicability of the
   model. Finally, we define an action framework outlining key actions for
   cities and suggest corresponding questions for future research. Beyond a
   simple call-to-action, this work provides a much-needed foundation for
   future research and practice leading to a sustainable future for all.}},

Title = {{Modular energy cost optimization for buildings with integrated microgrid}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{197}},
Pages = {{14-28}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Buildings are becoming suitable for application of sophisticated energy
   management approaches to increase their energy efficiency and possibly
   turn them into active energy market participants. The paper proposes a
   modular coordination mechanism between building zones comfort control
   and building microgrid energy flows control based on model predictive
   control. The approach opens possibilities to modularly coordinate
   technologically heterogeneous building subsystems for
   economically-optimal operation under user comfort constraints. The
   imposed modularity is based on a simple interface for exchanging
   building consumption and microgrid energy price profiles. This is a key
   element for technology separation, replication and up-scaling towards
   the levels of smart grids and smart cities where buildings play active
   roles in energy management. The proposed coordination mechanism is
   presented in a comprehensive realistic case study of maintaining comfort
   in an office building with integrated micro grid. The approach stands
   out with significant performance improvements compared to various non
   coordinated predictive control schemes and baseline controllers. Results
   give detailed information about yearly cost-effectiveness of the
   considered configurations, which are suitable for deployment as short
   and long-term zero-energy building investments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

   fluorescence: New approaches for air quality monitoring}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{178}},
Pages = {{504-512}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This work shows that total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) is a
   fast, easy and successful tool to determine the presence of potentially
   toxic elements in atmospheric aerosols precipitations on tree leaves.
   Leaves are collected in eleven parks of different geographical areas of
   the Brescia city, Northern Italy, for environmental monitoring purposes.
   Two sample preparation procedures are considered: microwave acid
   digestion and the novel SMART STORE method for direct analysis. The
   latter consists in sandwiching a portion of the leaf between two organic
   foils, metals free, to save it from contamination and material loss.
   Mass composition of macro, micro and trace elements is calculated for
   digested samples, while relative elemental amount are obtained from
   direct analysis. Washed and unwashed leaves have a different composition
   in terms of trace elements. Differentiation occurs according to Fe, Pb
   and Cu contributions, considered as most representative of air
   depositions, and probably related to anthropogenic sources. Direct
   analysis is more representative of the composition of air
   precipitations. Advantages and drawbacks of the presented methods of
   sample preparation and TXRF analysis are discussed. Results demonstrate
   that TXRF allows to perform accurate and precise quantitative analysis
   of digested samples. In addition, direct analysis of leaves may be used
   as a fast and simple method for screening in the nanograms range. (C)

Abstract = {{We consider continuous time Markovian processes where populations of
   individual agents interact stochastically according to kinetic rules.
   Despite the increasing prominence of such models in fields ranging from
   biology to smart cities, Bayesian inference for such systems remains
   challenging, as these are continuous time, discrete state systems with
   potentially infinite state-space. Here we propose a novel efficient
   algorithm for joint state/parameter posterior sampling in population
   Markov Jump processes. We introduce a class of pseudo-marginal sampling
   algorithms based on a random truncation method which enables a
   principled treatment of infinite state spaces. Extensive evaluation on a
   number of benchmark models shows that this approach achieves
   considerable savings compared to state of the art methods, retaining
   accuracy and fast convergence. We also present results on a synthetic
   biology data set showing the potential for practical usefulness of our
   work.}},

Abstract = {{Smart Cities are employing information and communication technologies in
   the quest for sustainable economic development and the fostering of new
   forms of collective life. They facilitate connections between citizens
   and organizations that are of paramount importance for their long-term

   intelligent nomadic data collection and users ` collaboration using
   smart Bluetooth technology. We demonstrate using two case-studies that
   our approach is capable of proposing an efficient spatial recognition
   service while supporting a range of users ` constraints, our system is
   disconnected from the internet, it can operate in any indoor/outdoor

Abstract = {{The positive and negative environmental impacts of information and
   communication technologies (ICTs) are widely debated. In theory, ICT is
   among the sources contributing to the increasing levels of CO2 emissions
   in terms of production of ICT machinery and devices, energy consumption,
   and recycling of electronic waste. However, ICT is also expected to
   reduce CO2 emissions on a global scale by developing smarter cities,
   transportation systems, electrical grids, industrial processes, and
   energy saving gains. These two effects work in opposite direction,
   creating an inverted-U relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions. The
   aim of this study is to investigate this non-linear relationship between
   ICT and CO2 emissions on a global scale. Given that global warming is a
   global issue, it is necessary to look at this relationship in countries
   at all levels of development. To this end, we use a panel data set
   consisting of 142 economies, split into 116 developing and 26 developed
   countries, over the period 1995-2010. The results of our empirical study
   confirm that the relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions is an
   inverted U-shaped relationship. Moreover, while for the sample of
   developing countries, the ICT turning point is well above the mean
   value, the opposite is true for the sample of developed countries. This
   implies that many developed countries have already attained the level of
   ICT development, at which CO2 emissions decreases as the level of ICT
   development improves further. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{With the acceleration of high data demand from mobile users and
   urbanization, Device-to-Device (D2D) communication networks have emerged
   as a new paradigm to alleviate the traffic load on the cellular
   networks. Due to high mobility of devices, establishing and ensuring the
   success of D2D transmission in an intermittently connected network is a
   major challenge. In this paper, we consider the challenging problem of
   synchronizing the content of a subset of nodes in D2D networks. We adopt
   the City Section mobility model to mimic node movement in a city area,
   and produce theoretical analysis to the properties of the model. Based
   on this model, we propose two content synchronization strategies called
   direct contact synchronization and relay-assisted synchronization. We
   provide theoretical analysis to the performance of the two strategies,
   which derives the theoretical upper bound of their synchronization
   delay. We further conduct simulations to compare the proposed
   algorithms, which confirms the theoretical conclusion that
   relay-assisted synchronization substantially outperforms direct contact
   synchronization in terms of success rate and delay with a slight
   increase in the cost. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   security threats and vulnerabilities by conducting an extensive survey
   of existing works in the area of IoT security. The taxonomy of the
   current security threats in the contexts of application, architecture,
   and communication is presented. This study also compares possible
   security threats in the IoT. We discuss the IoT security scenario and
   provide an analysis of the possible attacks. Open research issues and
   security implementation challenges in IoT security are described as
   well. This study aims to serve as a useful manual of existing security
   threats and vulnerabilities of the IoT heterogeneous environment and

Abstract = {{Protection and preservation of cultural heritage is an important
   responsibility for policy makers, public and private institutions, and
   the citizens themselves. Technologists can make an important
   contribution by designing monitoring systems for these sites and using
   the data to prevent incidents. Internet-of-things technology offers, for
   a sustainable price and with significant flexibility, a wide range of
   different possibilities, fitting different circumstances: from
   monitoring the environmental parameters of a room in a museum to sensing
   structural changes in a historical building and to protecting vulnerable
   artifacts. In this paper, we consider the case of monitoring an extended
   cultural heritage area: a UNESCO protected site, the center of Matera,
   an Italian town that will be a European Capital of Culture in 2019. This
   city is a unique historical settlement, as buildings are partially
   carved into the rock that constitutes the geological substrate of the
   area, a local practice used since the prehistoric age. The extent and
   density of these structures makes the physical protection of the site a
   big challenge when the expected large crowds of tourists arrive. The
   objective of the proposed system is to anticipate the threats in a
   timely manner so that appropriate actions are taken by the authorities
   thus avoiding damage to the cultural heritage sites.
   We propose a technique for modeling the performances of the
   Internet-of-things-based monitoring systems that support the planning of
   incident management in a protected site by exploiting multiple, sparse,
   heterogeneous, and partially controlled sensors to monitor the behavior
   of the crowd. The technique is based on the use of Markovian agent
   models to study the parameters and the dynamics of a scenario, to
   understand the needs of the monitoring system.}},

Abstract = {{Masses of sensors are being deployed at the scale of cities to manage
   parking spaces, transportation infrastructures to monitor traffic, and
   campuses of buildings to reduce energy consumption. These large-scale
   infrastructures become a reality for citizens via applications that
   orchestrate sensors to deliver high-value, innovative services. These
   applications critically rely on the processing of large amounts of data
   to analyze situations, inform users, and control devices. This paper
   proposes a design-driven approach to developing orchestrating
   applications for masses of sensors that integrates parallel processing
   of large amounts of data. Specifically, an application design exposes
   declarations that are used to generate a programming framework based on
   the MapReduce programming model. We have developed a prototype of our
   approach, using Apache Hadoop. We applied it to a case study and
   obtained significant speedups by parallelizing computations over twelve
   nodes. In doing so, we demonstrate that our design-driven approach
   allows to abstract over implementation details, while exposing
   architectural properties used to generate high-performance code for
   processing large datasets. Furthermore, we show that this
   high-performance support enables new, personalized services in a smart
   city. Finally, we discuss the expressiveness of our design language,
   identify some limitations, and present language extensions.}},

Title = {{Throughput and delay analysis of directional-location aided routing
   protocol for vehicular ad hoc networks}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc networks is an integral component of intelligent
   transportation systems and it is an important requisite for smarter
   cities. Network formation and deformation among the vehicles are very
   frequent because of the variation in speed. Furthermore, for safety
   applications, messages should not face any kind of delay or collision.
   Therefore, establishing communication between the vehicles becomes even
   more challenging. Position-based routing protocols work productively in
   vehicular ad hoc networks. Only finding an efficient routing protocol
   does not solve our purport. We need to carefully examine the effect of
   media access control layer parameters additionally. In the event of
   collisions, a large number of nodes would be re-transmitting rather than
   sending fresh packets. A node busy in sending the retransmitted packet
   is called a backlog node. With an increase in the number of collisions,
   number of backlog nodes also increases, which affects the delay and
   throughput. In this article, we present the mathematical modeling of
   delay and throughput with IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function
   (at media access control layer) for directional-location aided routing
   (D-LAR) position based routing protocol. For performance evaluation,
   simulation has been done in realistic environment created with SUMO
   (traffic simulator) and NS-2 (network simulator). Simulation results
   show the comparison between D-LAR and location aided routing (LAR) on
   various metrics in terms of delay, packet delivery ratio, routing
   overhead, throughput, and collision probability. To validate the
   mathematical model, analytical results has been compared with simulation
   results. The results confirm that performance of D-LAR is better than
   LAR in terms of increasing the throughput and reduction in routing
   overhead and delay.}},

   this knowledge gap through in-depth interviews with key professionals in

   results suggest that the strategic potential of place branding is
   negatively affected by a focus on operational thinking, which hinders
   innovation towards more holistic approaches to place management. Further

Abstract = {{Despite the increasing presence of wireless communications in everyday
   life, there exist some voices raising concerns about their adverse
   effects. One particularly relevant example is the potential impact of
   the electromagnetic field they induce on the population's health.
   Traditionally, very specialized methods and devices (dosimetry) have
   been used to assess the strength of the E-field, with the main objective
   of checking whether it respects the corresponding regulations. In this
   paper, we propose a complete novel approach, which exploits the
   functionality leveraged by a smart city platform. We deploy a number of
   measuring probes, integrated as sensing devices, to carry out a
   characterization embracing large areas, as well as long periods of time.
   This unique platform has been active for more than one year, generating
   a vast amount of information. We process such information, and the
   obtained results validate the whole methodology. In addition, we discuss
   the variation of the E-field caused by cellular networks, considering
   additional information, such as usage statistics. Finally, we establish
   the exposure that can be attributed to the base stations within the
   scenario under analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Data searching and retrieval is one of the fundamental functionalities
   in many Web of Things applications, which need to collect, process and
   analyze huge amounts of sensor stream data. The problem in fact has been
   well studied for data generated by sensors that are installed at fixed

   opportunistic sensing applications in which mobile sensors keep
   reporting observation and measurement data at variable intervals and
   changing geographical locations. To address these challenges, we develop
   the Geohash-Grid Tree, a spatial indexing technique specially designed
   for searching data integrated from heterogeneous sources in a mobile
   sensing environment. Results of the experiments on a real-world dataset
   collected from the SmartSantander smart city testbed show that the index
   structure allows efficient search based on spatial distance, range and

Abstract = {{Health and disaster risk reduction are important and necessary
   components in building a smart city, especially when climate change may
   increase the frequency of extreme temperatures and the health risks of
   urban dwellers. However, limited knowledge is available about the best
   way to disseminate weather warnings and health protection information.
   This study explores the weather information acquisition patterns of the
   Hong Kong public and examines the sociodemographic predictors of these
   patterns to establish the potential public health implications of smart
   city development. A population-based, stratified cross-sectional, random
   digit dialing telephone survey was conducted among the
   Cantonese-speaking population aged over 15 years in Hong Kong in early
   2016. Analyses were conducted based on 1017 valid samples, with a
   response rate of 63.6\%. Cold Weather Warnings were well disseminated in
   Hong Kong, with 95.7\% of the respondents reporting awareness of the
   public warnings. Television and smartphone apps were the two most
   important channels for weather information acquisition. Age and
   education level are the main social-demographic variables associated
   with the current utilization and future preference of smartphone
   technology. Among those who were not using a preferred channel to
   acquire weather information, 61.3\% considered switching to a smartphone
   app. Moreover, the patterns of individual health protection measures and
   self-reported health impacts were significantly different between
   smartphone app users and non-users. Weather information dissemination
   should be tailored to the sociodemographic characteristics of the users.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The rapid development of new technologies and the changing landscape of
   the online world (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of All,
   cloud-based solutions) provide a unique opportunity for developing
   automated and robotic systems for urban farming, agriculture, and
   forestry. Technological advances in machine vision, global positioning
   systems, laser technologies, actuators, and mechatronics have enabled
   the development and implementation of robotic systems and intelligent
   technologies for precision agriculture. Herein, we present and review
   robotic applications on plant pathology and management, and emerging
   agricultural technologies for intra-urban agriculture. Greenhouse
   advanced management systems and technologies have been greatly developed
   in the last years, integrating IoT and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network).
   Machine learning, machine vision, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) have
   been utilized and applied in agriculture for automated and robotic
   farming. Intelligence technologies, using machine vision/learning, have
   been developed not only for planting, irrigation, weeding (to some
   extent), pruning, and harvesting, but also for plant disease detection
   and identification. However, plant disease detection still represents an
   intriguing challenge, for both abiotic and biotic stress. Many
   recognition methods and technologies for identifying plant disease
   symptoms have been successfully developed; still, the majority of them
   require a controlled environment for data acquisition to avoid false
   positives. Machine learning methods (e.g., deep and transfer learning)
   present promising results for improving image processing and plant
   symptom identification. Nevertheless, diagnostic specificity is a
   challenge for microorganism control and should drive the development of
   mechatronics and robotic solutions for disease management.}},

Abstract = {{ERA-PLANET is a wide European network comprised of 118 researchers from
   35 partner institutions located in 18 countries, aiming to strengthen
   the European Research Area in the domain of Earth Observation (EO) in
   coherence with the European participation to the Group on Earth
   Observation (GEO) and the program for the establishment of a European
   capacity for Earth Observation, COPERNICUS. It will provide more
   accurate, comprehensive, and authoritative information to policy and
   decision-makers in key societal benefit areas (SBAs), under the
   umbrellas of dedicated projects in the topics of: smart cities and
   resilient societies; resource efficiency and environmental management;
   global changes and environmental treaties; polar areas and natural
   resources. ERA-PLANET will provide advanced decision support tools and
   technologies aimed to better monitor our global environment and share
   the information and knowledge in different domains of EO by launching
   joint transnational calls along the above four strands. The concept of
   the project that tackles with strand 1, as well as an example of a
   specific application fitting in, are described, aspiring to promote and
   coordinate the ``smart-city{''} approach into a European network of
   cities and non-European follower cities, serving the need for a common
   approach to enhance environmental and societal resilience to air
   pollution, urban growth, and urban heat islands, as well as other
   natural/manmade stresses and relevant impacts. This is achieved through
   the synergy among technology, government, and society, while at the same
   time creating bridges between local/national initiatives with GEO/GEOSS,
   COPERNICUS, and other smart cities and GEO relevant projects. The
   project addresses initiatives in European cities but also specific
   issues dealing with air quality management in other parts of the world.
   Finally, it places major emphasis on fully exploiting key-enabling
   technologies and firmly addressing interoperability issues, in the
   context of big ``smart city{''} data, and open science.}},

   particular, we propose a novel Technique for Order of Preference by
   Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) analysis framework to evaluate
   multiple factors of air pollutants and economic development. Our method
   can overcome the drawbacks of conventional TOPSIS methods by using

Abstract = {{Although the internet increases the availability of diabetes-related
   health information, health care consumers need to have different skills
   in order to obtain, interpret and evaluate such information. The eHealth
   literacy scale (eHEALS) was originally developed to assess consumers'
   perceived skills at using information technology for health. The
   objective of this study was to explore the experiences of older
   Hispanics' with type 2 diabetes in using the internet for diabetes
   management. This study was conducted in the USA among a convenience
   sample of older Hispanics with type 2 diabetes (n = 20) who attended a
   senior center in East Harlem, New York City. All participants first
   completed eHEALS and a demographic, diabetes-related, and smart phone
   use form either in English or Spanish and then participated in a focus
   group. Descriptive statistics and a univariate exploratory analysis were
   conducted to determine differences in electronic health literacy based
   on age or gender. In addition, qualitative data from the focus groups
   were analyzed. No significant differences were found based on age (F =
   0.76, p = 0.66), but a t-test found significant differences based on
   gender (t = -2.67, df = 18, p = 0.015). During the qualitative data
   analysis, five themes were identified from the focus group responses.
   Although the participants had access to the internet, they were not
   using the technology to access diabetes-related health information.
   Given the small sample size in this study, the Spanish version of the
   instrument needs to be used in a larger sample and further psychometric
   testing.}},

Abstract = {{The academic interest in social concepts in city contexts, such as sense
   of place and social capital, has been growing in the last decades. We
   present a systematic literature review that confirms the strong
   relationship between sense of place and social capital, from a social
   sciences point-of-view. It also reveal that little attention has been
   paid to their spatial dimensions at the urban level, thereby missing the
   chance to exploit socio-spatial knowledge to improve the day-to-day life
   in and functioning of the city (e.g. in planning processes, citizen
   participation, civic engagement). We therefore examine sense of place
   and social capital from a Geographic Information Science (GISc)
   viewpoint, and present a formal conceptualization and initial
   theoretical framework which explicitly describes both concepts, and the
   relation between them, within the context of a city and from a spatial

Abstract = {{Cities need to adapt to ageing societies because the average age of
   habitants is increasing rapidly alongside the global trend of
   urbanisation. Apparent effects on both society and individual
   livelihoods will continue to increase in the coming decades. Great hopes
   are projected on technology to support solutions for the ageing society
   and urban planning. Smart city strategies and the field of ambient
   assisted living are two concepts sharing the assumption that technology
   will make our lives more independent, more efficient and safer with a
   higher quality of life. This paper presents a case study of a
   participatory foresight project that investigates how transdisciplinary
   agenda setting through the means of including citizens, experts and
   stakeholders can provide orientation for long-term planning on the
   future of ageing in the city. Results enforce the argument that urban
   governance needs to address additional tasks whilst adapting to
   challenges arising from ageing societies and urbanisation. Alongside
   mere technological innovation, human factors gain importance.
   Future-oriented urban development strategies need to incorporate this
   fact and should not predominantly be drafted on the paradigm of
   technological progress.}},

   its potential and capacity to be integrated into any complex system. As
   a result of rapid development of sensing technologies such as

   IoT is emerging as an important technology for monitoring systems. This
   paper reviews and introduces a framework for structural health

   monitoring. Specifically, technologies involved in IoT and SHM system
   implementation as well as data routing strategy in IoT environment are
   presented. As the amount of data generated by sensing devices are

Abstract = {{Smart city services are enabled by a massive use of Internet of Things
   (IoT) technologies. The huge amount of sensors, and terminals with a
   great variety of typologies and applications, requires a secure way to
   manage them. Capillary networks can be seen as a short range extension
   of conventional access network in order to efficiently capture the IoT
   traffic, and are enablers for smart city services. They can include both
   IP and non-IP devices, and security can become an issue, especially when
   simple unidirectional communication devices are considered. The main
   goal of this paper is to analyze security aspects in IoT capillary
   networks including unidirectional and bidirectional IP or non-IP
   devices. We propose an algorithm for secure access for uni-and
   bi-directional devices. The security procedure is based on a secure key
   renewal (without any exchange in air), considering a local clock time
   and a time interval of key validity. Following previous work in 2014 by
   Giuliano et al., in this paper we assess the duration of the validity of
   the time window, and present extended simulation results in terms of
   (average) transmission time in a realistic scenario, i.e., including the
   presence of disturber(s), then providing indications for the setting of
   the duration of the key validity time window. Finally, we present the
   benchmark analysis in order to assess the effectiveness of our approach
   with respect to other existing standards, as well as the security
   analysis in terms of typical attacks.}},

Abstract = {{In construction of smart city, numerous vehicles' trajectory data are
   produced by Global Positioning System (GPS) to track their real time
   location. When these GPS data are processed by map matching, results can
   be used to support a large number of ITS applications such as real time
   road condition calculation, inspection of traffic event and emergency
   treatment. However, as the fast explosive growth of monitored vehicle
   number, massive GPS data proposes overwhelming challenges for map
   matching. Consequently, traditional map matching algorithms can hardly
   satisfy high demands for matching speed and accuracy. Therefore, a real
   time map matching algorithm for numerous GPS data is proposed to
   guarantee high matching accuracy and matching efficiency. Meanwhile, it
   can meet demands of GPS data processing required by the monitor of
   numerous vehicles within the city. Main contributions of the method are:
   (1) A Kalman filter based correcting algorithm is proposed to improve
   the matching accuracy of the traditional topological algorithm on the
   complicated road sections such as intersections and parallel roads. (2)
   Based on the Spark streaming framework, the serial map-matching
   algorithm is converted into a parallelized map-matching algorithm, which
   significantly improves the processing efficiency of the map matching.
   (3) A gridding method being applicable to the parallelized algorithm was
   proposed by the paper. The GPS data in the same grid were allocated to
   the same computing unit to improve the efficiency of the parallelized
   computation. Experimental results show that the matching accuracy of the
   algorithm demonstrated by the paper is increased by 10\%; the matching
   efficiency is 25\% higher than same amount of stand-alone computers. A
   cluster of 15 computers that operates the proposed algorithm is capable
   for the real time map matching for GPS data produced by 800 thousand
   vehicles, which can effectively and extensively support the lastingly
   increased demand for processing numerous GPS data.}},

Abstract = {{Polish international obligations, in particular the European Union and
   European Commission directives, pose a real challenge for Poland to
   radically reduce emissions of atmospheric pollutions and significantly
   increase the usage of energy coming from renewable sources in the
   overall energy balance of the country. These goals seem to be difficult
   to achieve, nevertheless the development and implementation of
   innovative concepts is always a step forward. Nowadays the renewable
   energy sources seem to be the panacea for the problems of pollutions and
   energy saving. Many inventors and scientists work on concept of smart
   grid technology. The basic concept of this technology is producing
   energy directly in the cities. It seems to be a good idea but often in
   urban areas there is no place for new installations or cost of land is
   the barrier. Therefore to produce and manage energy directly in the
   cities, we have to take into account many aspects such as cost of land,
   location, available renewable energy sources, number of inhabitants,
   electrical network, terrain obstacles, and local plans. Here is the good
   place to use geographic information system technology which can help us
   to analyze all these issues and combine spatial, satellite, and
   statistical data to create one coherent concept of managing various
   sources of energy in the cities. The aim of this study is to consider
   opportunities of using geographic information systems in supporting
   process of energy management in the cities. It was taken into account
   many important elements: solar conditions, impact of cloudiness on value
   of solar radiation, spatial data, buildings and electrical network,
   obstacles, and number of inhabitants. It is all for identify the
   advantages and disadvantages of geographic information system in the
   analysis of solar energy potential in the city.}},

Abstract = {{Road traffic congestion is an important issue in modem cities, however
   most existing traffic jam identification solutions are based on
   expensive facilities such as sensors or transport probe infrastructure
   with high deployment and management costs. As a result of the cost, such
   solutions are not ubiquitously deployed. The extensive use of smart
   mobile devices furnished with location-based competencies and the global
   popularity of microblogging applications like Twitter offers an
   opportunity to tackle these problems. Twritter users can serve as human
   traffic sensors providing real-time reflections of current traffic
   situations. However, these data can contain extensive personal privacy
   information that demands privacy preserving mechanisms for the user
   location and their current trajectory. Differential privacy can ensure
   that degrees of privacy in these trajectories can be preserved whilst
   allowing data analysis and mining of the Twitter content. This paper
   proposes an innovative private trajectories release model and associated
   algorithms with differential privacy guarantees that considers both data
   privacy and data utility. This includes development of a private
   reference system for calibrating separate (raw) users trajectories
   across obfuscated anchor points; construction of privacy supporting
   noise-enhanced prefix trees to release synthesis data privately, and
   comprehensive evaluation of both the accuracy and utility of the
   solutions in terms of a set of evaluation metrics based on real-life
   tweets-based user trajectories across the city of Melbourne. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Successful implementation of smart energy city projects in Europe is
   crucial for a sustainable transition of urban energy systems and the
   improvement of quality of life for citizens. We aim to develop a
   systematic classification and analysis of the barriers hindering
   successful implementation of smart energy city projects. Through an
   empirical approach, we investigated 43 communities implementing smart
   and sustainable energy city projects under the Sixth and Seventh
   Framework Programmes of the European Union. Validated through literature
   review, we identified 35 barriers categorized in policy, administrative,
   legal, financial, market, environmental, technical, social, and
   information-and-awareness dimensions. We prioritized these barriers,
   using a novel multi-imensional methodology that simultaneously analyses
   barriers based on frequency, level of impact, causal relationship among
   barriers, origin, and scale. The results indicate that the key barriers
   are lacking or fragmented political support on the long term at the
   policy level, and lack of good cooperation and acceptance among project
   partners, insufficient external financial support, lack of skilled and
   trained personnel, and fragmented ownership at the project level. The
   outcome of the research should aid policy-makers to better understand
   and prioritize implementation barriers to develop effective action and
   policy interventions towards more successful implementation of smart
   energy city projects.}},

Abstract = {{The development of approaches to taclde the European Union (EU)
   water-related challenges and shift towards sustainable water management
   and use is one of the main objectives of Horizon 2020, the EU strategy
   to lead a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The EU is an
   increasingly water challenged area and is a major agricultural trader.
   As agricultural trade entails an exchange of water embodied in goods as
   a factor of production, this study investigates the region's
   water-food-trade nexus by analysing infra-regional virtual water trade
   (VWT) in agricultural products. The analysed period (1993-2011)
   comprises the enactment of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in the
   year 2000. Aspects of the VWT that are relevant for the WFD are
   explored. The EU is a net importer of virtual water (VW) from the rest
   of the world, but intra-regional vwr represents 46\% of total imports
   and 75\% of total exports. Five countries account for 60\% of total VW
   imports (Germany, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Belgium) and 65\% of
   total VW exports (The Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium and Spain).
   Intra-EU VWT more than doubled over the period considered, while trade
   with extra-EU countries did not show such a marked trend. In the same
   period, blue VWT increased significantly within the region and net
   import from the rest of the world slightly decreased. Water scarce
   countries, such as Spain and Italy, are major exporters of blue water in
   the region. The traded volumes of VW have been increasing almost
   monotonically over the years, and with a substantial increase after
   2000. The overall trend in changes in VWT does not seem to be in
   accordance with the WFD goals. This study demonstrated that VWT analyses
   can help evaluate intertwining effects of water, agriculture and trade
   policies which are often made separately in respective sectors. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Our planet is gradually moving towards an urbanized world. Modern urban
   agglomerations tend to turn nowadays into advanced information hubs
   supporting a smart management of dynamic urban systems. The currently
   popular notion of `smart cities' aims to provide a new perspective for
   sustainable and high-performance strategies of city stakeholders in our
   `urban century'. In this context, digital information technology
   provides a new tool for efficient and effective management and planning
   of urban space, inter alia in the field of transportation, environment,
   public facilities or advanced service provision to citizens. This paper
   aims to offer, first, a concise overview of the emerging opportunities
   of information and communication technology (ICT) for smart urban
   policy; digital technology in particular, appears to provide novel
   pathways for modern planning strategies in smart cities. Against this
   background, the paper sketches out the complex force field of global
   urbanisation phenomena and highlights the data and information needs for
   strategic planning of cities (using inter alia as a framework the
   so-called `urban piazza' strategy framework). Secondly, various new
   decision support tools that are currently emerging and that offer a new
   promising scope for handling complex urban management issues (for
   instance, on accessibility, congestion, safety or sustainability) are
   briefly presented. And finally, the potential of such digital data
   systems for urban management and policy is concisely illustrated by
   means of some recent applications in the area of smartphone data
   systems. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges ahead
   for urban policy, inter alia by paying attention to institutional and
   governance aspects of `big digital data' management in urban systems.

Abstract = {{Reliable weather estimation traditionally requires a dense network of
   meteorological measurement stations. The concept of participatory
   sensing promises to alleviate this requirement by crowdsourcing weather
   data from an ideally very large set of participating users instead.
   Participation may involve nothing more than downloading a corresponding
   app to enable the collection of such data, given that modern smartphones
   contain a plethora of weather-related sensors. To understand the
   potential of participatory sensing for weather estimation, and how
   humans can be put ``in the loop{''} to further improve such sensing, we
   created Atmos - a crowdsourcing weather app that not only periodically
   samples smartphones' sensors for weather measurements, but also allows
   users to enter their own estimates of both current and future weather
   conditions. We present the results of a 32-month public deployment of
   Atmos on the Google Play Store, showing that a combination of both types
   of ``sensing{''} results in accurate temperature estimates, featuring an
   average error rate of 2.7 degrees C, whereas when using only user
   inputs, the average error rate drops to 1.86 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Very limited studies have examined infill development in the context of
   suburban areas or small towns, and only a few studies have broadly
   analyzed the parcels potential for infill in the inner city context.
   This paper develops a quantitative and visual model with a ranking
   system for infill developable sites using geographic information systems
   (GIS) technology. The model, which is only applied to vacant parcels,
   evaluates these parcels in accordance with eight criteria. Using a
   numeric coding system for selected urban sustainability and smart growth
   metrics and a weighting value, a GIS raster model was generated for the
   vacant parcels. With the summing up of the composite scores and a
   compartmentalization of parcel's quality, a final ranking system for
   parcel's suitability for infill development is generated. Unlike the
   preceding assessments, this method yields a larger amount of developable
   sites with different infill quality according to a four-level scale and
   offers both visual and quantitative outputs. The results provide
   planning officials with a feasible and traceable tool to share with the
   public, to utilize to support future decisions regarding land
   development and rezoning, and to adopt by both by urban and peri-urban

Abstract = {{The paper addresses the growing scepticism around big data use in the
   context of smart cities. Big data is said to transform city governments
   into being more efficient, effective and evidence-based. However,
   critics point towards the limited capacity of government to overcome the
   siloed structure of data storage and manage the diverse stakeholders
   involved in setting up a data ecosystem. On the basis of this, the paper
   investigates the challenges city governments face when dealing with big
   data in the context of carbon emission reduction. Through the lens of
   the evidence-based policy and policy capacity literature, the cities of
   Copenhagen (Denmark), London (UK), Malmo (Sweden), Oxford (UK) and
   Vienna (Austria) are analysed. The cases reveal that the institutional
   complexity underlying big data integration limits local government
   capacity to set up data management structures that would allow further
   utilization of big data and that current solutions focus on local pilot
   sites and outsourcing of data analytics.}},

   This paper presents results from a technology assessment tool developed
   together with six mid-sized European cities. The main areas of focus
   have been evaluated based on the cities' priorities: transportation
   (both public and private) and consumers' perspectives on the use of
   smart electricity meters. The use of electric vehicles in Sweden, and a
   techno-economic evaluation of biogas-derived biomethane and electricity
   use in public transportation have been analyzed. The main conclusions
   show an overall higher efficiency for biogas-derived electricity use in
   electric buses; a need for higher consumer engagement through more
   detailed information provision for both increasing EV market penetration
   and electricity savings; and a need to establish detailed technology
   assessments for successful technology adoption in cities. (C) 2016

Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{183-212}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, the concept of smart sustainable cities has come to the
   fore. And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a
   promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This
   pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced
   nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of
   smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations
   and assumptions, state-of-the art research and development, research
   opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological
   trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the
   paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city
   approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular
   emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to
   the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates
   these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and
   approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with
   the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field
   of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond
   the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is
   proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the
   existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in
   the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the
   findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less
   explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied
   purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to
   their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also
   reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be
   realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on
   the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically
   convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic
   smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to
   address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies
   pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form with support of
   ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and
   context-aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We
   conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable
   cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance given
   that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that
   the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with
   practical applications. The comprehensive overview of and critique on
   existing work on smart (and) sustainable cities provide a valuable and
   seminal reference for researchers and practitioners in related research
   communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of
   the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning
   and development. In addition, the proposed holistic approach is believed
   to be the first of its kind. That is, it has not been, to the best of
   one's knowledge, investigated or produced elsewhere. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {{Modelling the urban heat island effect of smart growth policy scenarios
   in Brisbane}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{38-55}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Smart growth policy has been identified as a panacea to tackle a range
   of undesirable outcomes of sprawl development. Various neighbourhood
   planning concepts have been developed following smart growth principles
   such as transit oriented development, and infill development. Existing
   empirical studies, however, do not answer to a key policy question: can
   smart growth policies reduce the urban heat island (UHI) effect? If so,
   what type of smart growth policy would be most effective? This research
   examined the questions by deriving five alternative neighbourhood
   planning scenarios for Brisbane for 2023: a) business as usual, b)
   transit oriented development (TOD), c) infill development, d) motorway
   corridor oriented development, and e) sprawl development. The research
   utilises Landsat remote sensing images of 1991, 2004, and 2013 to:
   first, estimate and validate a Geographically Weighted Regression model
   in order to identify statistically significant factors influencing the
   UHI intensities in Brisbane; and second, predict the UHI intensities of
   the five policy scenarios. Two factors were identified to have
   significant influence on the UHI intensities in Brisbane: population
   density, and porosity. Results show that compared to the 2004 and 2013
   levels, Brisbane will respectively experience a higher and lower levels
   of UHI effect in 2023, irrespective of the policy scenarios. On average,
   the infill development scenario, as a smart growth policy, has a
   marginally better potential to mitigate the UHI effect in Brisbane in
   2023 compared to the sprawl development scenario conditional on the
   definition applied in this research. The UHI effect would be more
   equitably balanced spatially under the sprawl development scenario. (C)

   Traffic Information for Urban Traffic Networks}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays many studies are being conducted to develop solutions for
   improving the performance of urban traffic networks. One of the main
   challenges is the necessary cooperation among different entities such as
   vehicles or infrastructure systems and how to exploit the information
   available through networks of sensors deployed as infrastructures for
   smart cities. In this work an algorithm for cooperative control of urban
   subsystems is proposed to provide a solution for mobility problems in
   cities. The interconnected traffic lights controller (TLC) network
   adapts traffic lights cycles, based on traffic and air pollution sensory
   information, in order to improve the performance of urban traffic
   networks. The presence of air pollution in cities is not only caused by
   road traffic but there are other pollution sources that contribute to
   increase or decrease the pollution level. Due to the distributed and
   heterogeneous nature of the different components involved, a system of
   systems engineering approach is applied to design a consensus-based
   control algorithm. The designed control strategy contains a
   consensus-based component that uses the information shared in the
   network for reaching a consensus in the state of TLC network components.
   Discrete event systems specification is applied for modelling and
   simulation. The proposed solution is assessed by simulation studies with
   very promising results to deal with simultaneous responses to both
   pollution levels and traffic flows in urban traffic networks.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Even though home automation is a well-known research and development
   area, recent technological improvements in different areas such as
   context recognition, sensing, wireless communications or embedded
   systems have boosted wireless smart homes. This paper focuses on some of
   those areas related to home automation. The paper draws attention to
   wireless communications issues on embedded systems. Specifically, the
   paper discusses the multi-hop networking together with Bluetooth
   technology and latency, as a quality of service (QoS) metric. Bluetooth
   is a worldwide standard that provides low power multi-hop networking. It
   is a radio license free technology and establishes point-to-point and
   point-to-multipoint links, known as piconets, or multi-hop networks,
   known as scatternets. This way, many Bluetooth nodes can be
   interconnected to deploy ambient intelligent networks. This paper
   introduces the research on multi-hop latency done with park and sniff
   low power modes of Bluetooth over the test platform developed. Besides,
   an empirical model is obtained to calculate the latency of Bluetooth
   multi-hop communications over asynchronous links when links in
   scatternets are always in sniff or the park mode. Smart home devices and
   networks designers would take advantage of the models and the estimation
   of the delay they provide in communications along Bluetooth multi-hop
   networks.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, various static wireless sensor networks (WSN) are deployed in
   the environment for many purposes: traffic control, pollution
   monitoring, and so on. The willingness to open these legacy WSNs to the
   users is emerging, by integrating them to the Internet network as part
   of the future Internet of Things (IoT), for example, in the context of
   smart cities and open data policies. While legacy sensors cannot be
   directly connected to the Internet in general, emerging standards such
   as 6LoWPAN are aimed at solving this issue but require us to update or
   replace the existing devices. As a solution to connect legacy sensors to
   the IoT, we propose to take advantage of the multi-modal connectivity as
   well as the mobility of smartphones to use phones as opportunistic
   proxies, that is, mobile proxies that opportunistically discover closeby
   static sensors and act as intermediaries with the IoT, with the
   additional benefit of bringing fresh information about the environment
   to the smartphones' owners. However, this requires us to monitor the
   smartphone's mobility and further infer when to discover and register
   the sensors to guarantee the efficiency and reliability of opportunistic
   proxies. To that end, we introduce and evaluate an approach based on
   mobility analysis that uses a novel path prediction technique to predict
   when and where the user is not moving, and thereby serves to anticipate
   the registration of sensors within communication range. We show that
   this technique enables the deployment of low-cost resource-efficient
   mobile proxies to connect legacy WSNs with the IoT.}},

Abstract = {{The South Korean and Seoul metropolitan governments have been forced to
   radically change the current High Pressure Sodium (HPS) lamps to Light
   Emitting Diode (LED) lamps for street lighting in cities according to
   ``LED Plan 2060.{''} Thus, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility
   of LED-based street lighting by analyzing energy efficiency and life
   cycle cost. For this purpose, a comparison of the lighting energy
   consumption by dimming control in Wooi Stream as a test bed project was
   conducted and the life cycle cost of LED lamps for replacing HPS lamps
   for street lighting was analyzed. As a result, LED lamp replacement
   could reduce the energy consumption by 69\% compared to HPS lamps, and
   the dimming control system by pedestrian movements could save 77\% of
   lighting energy. However, the payback period of LED replacement is 11.5
   years. This indicates that the high purchase price of LED lamps would
   decline by 80\% within 4-5 years with assertive investment for
   commercializing LED lamps and rapid growth of the lighting market in
   Korea, if LED lamps in street lighting have an economic performance.}},

Abstract = {{A novel initiative in providing advanced civic amenities is the idea of
   smart city driven by the Internet of Things. Owing to a lack of
   consensus regarding what constitutes a smart city, diverse smart city
   architectures have been proposed. However, it is observed that adequate
   consideration is not given to the most important element of a smart city
   i.e. its people. In our opinion, energy efficient technologically driven
   city does not necessarily lead to a smart city. Ethics, tradition and
   law form essential ingredients of complex social palette that cannot be
   ignored. In this work we propose Ethics-Aware Object-Oriented Smart City
   Architecture (EOSCA) that has two distinguishing features. Firstly, we
   propose an object oriented layered architecture where an object
   represents an abstraction of a real world thing along with requisite
   security and ethics parameters. Secondly, we propose to integrate
   socio-cultural and ethical aspects within the smart city architecture by
   dedicating a separate ethics layer. Such enhancement not only addresses
   the challenge of privacy and security of a smart city, but also makes it
   people friendly by incorporating ethics. Such measures would facilitate
   social acceptance of smart city paradigm and augment its economic value.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient urban transportation systems are widely accepted as essential
   infrastructure for smart cities, and they can highly increase a city's
   vitality and convenience for residents. The three core pillars of smart
   cities can be considered to be data mining technology, IoT, and mobile
   wireless networks. Enormous data from IoT is stimulating our cities to
   become smarter than ever before. In transportation systems, data-driven
   management can dramatically enhance the operating efficiency by
   providing a clear and insightful image of passengers' transportation
   behavior. In this article, we focus on the data validity problem in a
   cellular network based transportation data collection system from two
   aspects: internal time discrepancy and data loss. First, the essence of
   time discrepancy was analyzed for both automated fare collection (AFC)
   and automated vehicular location (AVL) systems, and it was found that
   time discrepancies can be identified and rectified by analyzing
   passenger origin inference success rate using different time shift
   values and evolutionary algorithms. Second, the algorithmic framework to
   handle location data loss and time discrepancy was provided. Third, the
   spatial distribution characteristics of location data loss events were
   analyzed, and we discovered that they have a strong and positive
   relationship with both high passenger volume and shadowing effects in
   urbanized areas, which can cause severe biases on passenger traffic
   analysis. Our research has proposed some data-driven methodologies to
   increase data validity and provided some insights into the influence of
   IoT level data loss on public transportation systems for smart cities.}},

Abstract = {{While a number of studies reveal the performance and effectiveness of
   applying wireless systems to various smart city applications,
   surprisingly, a market environment, in which we rely on a daily or
   weekly basis for purchasing essential goods, is still understudied. A
   wireless system in a market, along with rapidly growing IoT technology,
   can enable interesting applications such as automated electronic price
   tag updates, shopping-cart-based advertisements and information display,
   and automated inventory/stock management. These applications can first
   benefit market staff by automating routine tasks or opening
   possibilities for additional profits. Not only that: for everyday
   customers, these applications provide more reliable services by
   eliminating many man-made errors and offer additional services that can
   be enabled by newly gained connectivities. In this work, we introduce
   application requirements and technical challenges for such smart market
   applications and pilot deployment experiences in an urban large-scale
   market. Our pilot deployment experiences of wireless systems in markets
   provide quantified knowledge on the impact of various in-market
   activities on the wireless link performance and led us to design
   MarketNet, a wireless networking architecture suitable for IoT-based
   smart market systems. We see this work as a first step in bringing the
   attention of many researchers to a new application area, where wireless
   systems have the potential to benefit the quality of life of many smart

Abstract = {{It is expected that the incessant use of SBSs by indoor mobile users to
   achieve high data rate and high energy efficiency for their smart mobile
   devices will drive ultra dense deployment of SCNs within MCNs,
   specifically in future smart cities. However, SCN densification has a
   hard effect on the deterioration of the energy efficiency and QoS
   throughput of mobile users equipped with smart mobile devices like
   smartphones, laptops, PDAs, and tablets. This degradation is due to the
   severe cross-tier interferences occurring in ultra dense co-channel
   deployments of SCNs within MCNs. The present article intends to study
   the energy efficiency of mobile users for better battery life management
   of their smart mobile devices through minimal energy consumption during
   their uplink transmissions. The proposed solution, based on a fully
   decentralized algorithm for sharing time access executed by SBSs and
   multi-homing capabilities of macrocellular users, improves the energy
   efficiency of mobile users for better battery life, and keeps their QoS
   throughput requirements. Therefore, it leads to the eco-friendly smart
   mobile devices required in future smart cities. The results validate our
   proposed solution and show the improvement achieved compared to the
   conventional access control mechanisms. Furthermore, our scheme requires
   no coordination among SBSs and macro base stations, which reduces the
   huge signaling overhead when using cooperative schemes.}},

   and sensors to the core network, and is the key infrastructure to
   facilitate a smart city. The beamforming and spatial multiplexing
   technologies enable the wireless multipoint-to-point backhaul to connect
   dense small cell eNodeBs (eNBs) and macrocell eNBs. Because the spatial
   characteristics of the backhaul channels, such as the angular power
   spectra and spreads, determine the interference and capacity performance
   of the backhaul links, accurate 3D channel modeling is vital for the
   evaluation and comparison of candidate proposals. In this article, the
   concepts and methodology of spatial channel modeling are first
   introduced, and the state-of-the-art models developed by the
   standardization bodies in recent years are surveyed. Then we present a
   field measurement campaign on the 3D backhaul channels in an urban
   street, including the channel sounder implementation, field measurement,
   multipath parameter estimation, and propagation modeling. The Rx of the
   sounder (emulating a donor eNB) was installed on the rooftop of a
   five-story building, and the Tx was located along a street and at
   different altitudes to emulate a relay eNB. The channel angular power
   spectra in the elevation and azimuth domains were measured, and the
   impact by the relay's distance and altitude on the angular spreads was
   evaluated. In addition, a Laplace model is proposed for the power
   spectra in both domains. This article not only explains the methodology
   and implementation of the spatial channel measurement, but also reveals
   the urban wireless backhaul channel characteristics which are useful for
   the design and deployment of wireless backhaul for a smart city.}},

Abstract = {{Charging management for EVs on the move has become an increasingly
   important research problem in smart cities. Major technical challenges
   include the selection of charging stations to guide charging plans, and
   the design of cost-efficient communication infrastructure between the
   power grid and EVs. In this article, we first present a brief review on
   state-of-the-art EV charging management schemes. Next, by incorporating
   battery switch technology to enable fast charging service, a
   publish/subscribe communication framework is provisioned to support the
   EV charging service. After that, we develop a fully distributed charging
   management scheme with consideration of urban travel uncertainties, for
   example, traffic congestion and drivers' preferences. This would benefit
   from low privacy sensitivity, as EVs' status information will not be
   released through management. Results demonstrate a guidance for the
   provisioning of a P/S communication framework to improve EV drivers'
   experience, for example, charging waiting time and total trip duration.
   Also, the benefit of a P/S communication framework is reflected in terms
   of the communication efficiency. Open research issues in this emerging
   area are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicles searching for a parking space are currently one of the most
   critical traffic problems in numerous cities throughout the world and
   cause of up to 30 \% of inner-city traffic. For motorists, this means
   spending an unnecessary amount of time looking for a parking space. For
   cities, this results in increased air pollution and noise emissions,
   which present them with great challenges especially in respect to
   environmental protection and quality of life. Bosch, the supplier of
   technology and services offers with Connected Parking smart services
   that take the hassle out of finding a parking space and alleviate the
   consequences. With the services Active Parking Lot Management and
   Community-based Parking, a glance at the navigation system or smartphone
   will be enough to find the nearest free parking space on the side of the
   street, in a parking lot or in a car park. This is made possible by
   vehicle sensors that are mainly already installed as standard as well as
   ground sensors integrated in the infrastructure. Those sensors detect
   free parking spaces and collect them centrally. Drivers looking for a
   parking space receive information on free parking spots in real time and
   can thereby be led directly to free parking spaces without any detours.
   This considerably reduces parking problems in inner city areas and
   increases quality of life. At the same time, the decrease in traffic
   looking for parking spaces through Connected Parking services also
   reduces vehicle emissions in the city. With Automated Valet Parking,
   parking is done fully automatically and driverless. The person looking
   for a parking space gives up his or her car at the entrance to a parking
   lot or parking garage and lets the vehicle drive autonomously to a free
   parking space and park there guided by the intelligent infrastructure.
   Also car park operators' benefit from Automated Valet Parking through
   the increased efficiency of existing parking spaces since significantly
   more vehicles can be accommodated in the same area.}},

Abstract = {{Global urbanization and urban sprawl have made urban land efficiency
   (ULE) a significant issue for sustainable development. The Yangtze River
   Delta (YRD), the largest globalizing city region in China, has
   experienced dramatic urbanization, and land for future development has
   become a scarce commodity. This paper explores the spatial patterns and
   underlying determinants of ULE in the YRD, focusing on accessibility and
   economic transition. We find that the spatial agglomeration effect of
   ULE has intensified with the development of transportation accessibility
   and has mainly spread from southern Jiangsu to other areas. The
   integrated transportation and spatial autoregressive (TSAR) model
   suggests that accessibility and globalization play a significantly
   positive role in ULE, and that marketization as well as decentralization
   also have significant effects. Furthermore, a geographically weighted
   regression (GWR) shows that the drivers of ULE vary across the YRD. ULE
   in northern Zhejiang is more sensitive to foreign direct investment
   (FDI) and tertiary industry development, while ULE in southern and
   central Jiangsu are more likely to be associated with globalization and
   labor-intensive manufacturing. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Wireless multihop infrastructure (WMI) networks can provide essential
   support for information exchange and the Internet access, particularly
   during emergencies and in smart cities. However, limited network
   resources during emergencies may result in node energy depletion and
   network disconnection, leading to service failures to users in the WMI
   network. This paper aims to use mobile base stations (MBSs) to
   automatically form paths and spontaneously maintain network availability
   as a connected infrastructure. The problems to deal with are the limited
   information and resources for MBS to quickly construct efficient
   connections in a WMI network. We propose a bio-inspired approach, which
   enables MBS to interact with the network based on insights from
   conformational selections in enzyme-substrate binding. In analogy to
   selective binding of enzyme-substrates, the proposed MBS approach uses
   selective pauses based on the traffic status of selective packet
   forwarding at appropriate positions, at which MBS is capable of
   sustaining WMI connectivity. The proposed MBS approach reduces energy
   consumption of base stations that have energy constraints and heavy
   traffic to handle, and it improves WMI network availability. Evaluation
   using packet-level simulation reveals that the proposed MBS approach
   achieves up to 40\% improvement for the availability of network as a
   full connected infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{The Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG), invented in 2012, is an emerging
   energy harvesting technology that efficiently converts ambient
   mechanical energy into electricity. Much work has been done to develop
   this device and improve its performance. However, no systematic report
   about its applications through large-scale publication and patent data
   analysis is available. In this study, we use ``Tech Mining,{''} a
   systematic analytical method based on structured texts applied to
   publication and patent abstract data, to analyze potential applications
   of TENGs. A series of applications from product scale to industry scale
   are identified. The findings show that when used as sensors, TENGs are
   mostly applicable in automation and energy-intensive industries such as
   automotive, medical or surgical devices, consumer electronics and
   household appliances. TENGs in the form of sensors can also be
   integrated with future-oriented and exponentially growing technologies
   such as robotics, drones, nanotechnology, and bioinformatics that will
   create enormous value for future economies. Moreover, applications of
   TENGs as sensors are also in line with current global trends of science
   and technology development, including the ``Internet of Things,{''} big
   data, clean energy, and smart cities. Combined with those technologies
   and industries, TENGs can help in tackling challenges of global warming,
   environmental pollution and security systems. We suggest the TENG
   research community to widen interdisciplinary collaboration, pursue
   connections with industry, and file more patents as R \& D progresses.
   In addition, research limitations and future development directions of
   TENG are pointed out.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, the rapid growth of cities and exacerbated social
   problems have led to a great deal of inquiry on the extent to which the
   physical forms of cities can contribute towards achieving a just and
   sustainable future. Past investigations in the western context have
   remained less than satisfactory, further raising concerns about their
   applicability to the developing world cities which face essentially
   different urbanisation challenges and socio-cultural shifts. As India
   prepares itself to become an urban majority by 2050 and gives shape to
   its futuristic smart cities, there is clearly a pressing need to develop
   stronger empirical evidence about the influence of urban forms on social
   sustainability which links to sustainable design, policies and
   practices. This research therefore, tests the effects of urban forms on
   six aspects of social sustainability using both, qualitative and

Abstract = {{In smart cities, the networked control system plays a significant role
   in transportation systems, power stations or other critical
   infrastructures, and it is facing many security issues. From this point,
   this paper proposes a content-based deep communication control approach
   to guarantee its security. Based on the layer architecture, this
   approach analyzes the interactive content in depth according to
   different industrial communication protocols, and implements the access
   control between two distinct enclaves. For OPC Classic, we acquire the
   dynamic port provided by OPC server, and open a new connection belonging
   to this port; for Modbus/TCP, we not only analyze the ordinary function
   codes and addresses, but also check the register or coil values by using
   the multi-bit Trie-tree matching algorithm. Besides, the white-listing
   strategy is introduced to satisfy the special requirements of industrial
   communication. Our experiment results show that, on the one hand the
   proposed approach provides OPC and Modbus/TCP defenses in depth; on the
   other hand it has less than 1 ms forwarding latency and 0 packet loss
   rate when the rule number reaches 200, and all these meet the
   availability requirements in the networked control system. In
   particular, this approach has been successfully applied in several
   real-world petrochemical control systems.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{230-239}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Energy saving is a hot topic due to the proliferation of climate changes
   and energy challenges globally. However, people's perception about using
   smart technology for energy saving is still in the concept stage. This
   means that people talk about environmental awareness readily, yet in
   reality, they accept to pay the given energy bill. Due to the
   availability of electricity and its integral role, modulating consumers'
   attitudes towards energy savings can be a challenge. Notably, the gap in
   today's smart technology design in smart homes is the understanding of
   consumers' behaviour and the integration of this understanding into the
   smart technology. As part of the Paris Climate change agreement (2015),
   it is paramount for Singapore to introduce smart technologies targeted
   to reduce energy consumption. This paper focused on the perception of
   Singapore households on smart technology and its usage to save energy.
   Areas of current research include: (1) energy consumption in Singapore
   households, (2) public programs and policies in energy savings, (3) use
   of technology in energy savings, and (4) household perception of energy
   savings in smart homes. Furthermore, three case studies are reviewed in
   relation to smart homes and smart technology, while discussing the
   maturity of existing solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Since the inception of modern urban planning in the early 20th century,
   numerous urban planning policies have been introduced that seek to steer
   urban form towards desired patterns. Some have explicitly focused on
   promoting energy efficient urban forms to reduce carbon emissions and
   contribute to sustainable urban metabolism. Despite the proliferation of
   such policies, `unsustainable' trends, such as urban sprawl and long
   distance car-based commuting, continue and in some cases are worsening.
   In this paper, we aim to explore the limited success of a number of
   influential urban planning policies in Europe and North America in
   trying to steer urban form towards a more sustainable path. Our aim is
   to identify their potential common shortcomings and suggest a number of
   principles which may help formulating more effective policy packages for

Abstract = {{Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have emerged as a revolutionary technology
   in many application domains in health-care, fitness, smart cities, and
   many other compelling Internet of Things (loT) applications. Most
   commercially available systems assume that a single device monitors a
   plethora of user information. In reality, BSN technology is
   transitioning to multi-device synchronous measurement environments;
   fusion of the data from multiple, potentially heterogeneous, sensor
   sources is therefore becoming a fundamental yet non-trivial task that
   directly impacts application performance. Nevertheless, only recently
   researchers have started developing technical solutions for effective
   fusion of BSN data. To the best of our knowledge, the community is
   currently lacking a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art
   techniques on multi-sensor fusion in the area of BSN. This survey
   discusses clear motivations and advantages of multi-sensor data fusion
   and particularly focuses on physical activity recognition, aiming at
   providing a systematic categorization and common comparison framework of
   the literature, by identifying distinctive properties and parameters
   affecting data fusion design choices at different levels (data, feature,
   and decision). The survey also covers data fusion in the domains of
   emotion recognition and general-health and introduce relevant directions
   and challenges of future research on multi-sensor fusion in the BSN
   domain. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Low-energy critical infrastructure monitoring (LECIM) networks is
   essential for the monitoring of infrastructure facilities in smart
   cities. One critical requirement of an LECIM network is its wide
   coverage of up to several kilometres by using a star topology instead of
   the tree or mesh networks. In meeting this requirement, this study
   develops a system with a transceiver of extremely high receiver
   sensitivity based on the IEEE 802.15.4k physical layer specifications.
   To reduce the energy consumption, the modulation schemes suitable for
   low complexity detection are chosen for the data transmission in the
   design. Also, an efficient parallel preamble and payload data detection
   are adopted at the access point of the proposed LECIM to acquire
   concurrent packets from respective nodes. Meanwhile, a data-aided
   dynamic timing adjustment scheme is proposed for data field detection to
   rapidly and adaptively synchronise to the long duration of data packet.
   Furthermore, a testbed is implemented using a software-defined radio to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system design.}},

Title = {{Optimization of a flexible multi-generation system based on wood chip
   gasification and methanol production}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{192}},
Pages = {{337-359}},

Abstract = {{Flexible multi-generation systems (FMGs) consist of integrated and
   flexibly operated facilities that provide multiple links between the
   different sectors of the energy system. The present study treated the
   design optimization of a conceptual FMG which integrated a
   methanol-producing biorefinery with an existing combined heat and power
   (CHP) unit and industrial energy utility supply in the Danish city of
   Horsens. The objective was to optimize economic performance and minimize
   total CO2 emission of the FMG while it was required to meet the local
   district heating demand plus the thermal utility demand of the butchery.
   The design optimization considered: Selection, dimensioning, location
   and integration of processes; operation optimization with respect to
   both hourly variations in Operating conditions over the year as well as
   expected long term energy system development; and uncertainty analysis
   considering both investment costs and operating conditions.
   Applying a previously developed FMG design methodology, scalable models
   of the considered processes were developed and the system design was
   optimized with respect to hourly operation over the period 2015-2035.
   The optimal design with respect to both economic and environmental
   performance involved a maximum-sized biorefinery located next to local
   industry rather than in connection with the existing CHP unit. As the
   local industry energy demands were limited when compared to the
   biorefinery dimensions considered, process integration synergies were
   found to be marginal when compared to the economic and environmental
   impact of the biorefinery for the present case.
   Assessing the impact of uncertainties on the estimated FMG performances,
   the net present value (NPV) of the optimal design was estimated to vary
   within the range 252.5-1471.6 ME in response to changes of 25\% in
   investment costs and methanol price, and considering two different
   electricity price scenarios. In addition, a change in the interest rate
   from 5\% to 20\% was found to reduce the lower bound of the NPV to 181.3
   ME for reference operating conditions. The results suggest that the
   applied interest rate and operating conditions, in particular the
   methanol price, would have a much higher impact on the economic
   performance of the designs than corresponding uncertainties in
   investment costs. In addition, the study outcomes emphasize the
   importance of including systematic uncertainty analysis in the design
   optimization of FMG concepts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Most of the existing research on emergency evacuation strategies focus
   on city evacuation planning that highly depends on the use of vehicles
   or evacuation from buildings. However, for large areas with limited use
   of vehicles such as theme parks, evacuation of pedestrians and emergent
   events must be tracked for safety reasons. As hazards may cause certain
   damages to services, networks with disaster resilience are needed to
   achieve mission-critical operations such as search and rescue. In this
   paper, we develop a method for tracking pedestrians and emergent events
   during disasters by opportunistic ad hoc communication. In our network
   model, smart-phones of pedestrians store and carry messages to a limited
   number of mobile sinks. Mobile sinks are responsible for communicating
   with smart-phones and reaching the emergent events effectively. Since
   the positioning of the mobile sinks has a direct impact to the network
   performance, we propose physical force based (PF), grid allocation based
   (GA) and road allocation based (RA) approaches for sink placement and
   mobility. The proposed approaches are analyzed through extensive network
   simulations using real theme park maps and a human mobility model for
   disaster scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed
   approaches achieve significantly better network coverage and higher
   rescue success without producing increased communication overhead
   compared to two random mobile sink movement models.}},

Title = {{Glyph-based video visualization on Google Map for surveillance in smart
   cities}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING}},

Abstract = {{Video visualization (VV) is considered to be an essential part of
   multimedia visual analytics. Many challenges have arisen from the
   enormous video content of cameras which can be solved with the help of
   data analytics and hence gaining importance. However, the rapid
   advancement of digital technologies has resulted in an explosion of
   video data, which stimulates the needs for creating computer graphics
   and visualization from videos. Particularly, in the paradigm of smart
   cities, video surveillance as a widely applied technology can generate
   huge amount of videos from 24/7 surveillance. In this paper, a state of
   the art algorithm has been proposed for 3D conversion from traffic video
   content to Google Map. Time-stamped glyph-based visualization is used
   effectively in outdoor surveillance videos and can be used for
   event-aware detection. This form of traffic visualization can
   potentially reduce the data complexity, having holistic view from larger
   collection of videos. The efficacy of the proposed scheme has been shown
   by acquiring several unprocessed surveillance videos and by testing our
   algorithm on them without their pertaining field conditions.
   Experimental results show that the proposed visualization technique
   produces promising results and found effective in conveying meaningful
   information while alleviating the need of searching exhaustively
   colossal amount of video data.}},

Abstract = {{In order to increase and develop overall performance of Modern Network
   Grids in Smart Cities of India with acceptable levels of security and
   privacy, the internal and external factors which substantially affect
   the performance of network grids in Smart Cities without jeopardizing
   privacy and security issues are needed to be identified. Besides, the
   interdependencies of these critical success factors are needed to be
   realized clearly. This paper seeks to identify these critical factors
   and also takes a sincere attempt to ascertain the main driving forces
   among these critical success factors and to ascertain inter-relationship
   among the CSFs. These factors here have been identified by the help of
   three reliable instruments which are questionnaire based survey,
   brainstorming and finally consolidation by Principal Component Analysis
   (PCA). A total of 16 critical success factors eventually have been
   detected by the help of PCA and finally a pragmatic structure of
   inter-relationship among the CSFs been developed by the application of
   Interpretive Structural Model (ISM).}},

Title = {{Household Smart Water Metering in Spain: Insights from the Experience of
   Remote Meter Reading in Alicante}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Since the past few years, the smart city paradigm has been influencing
   sustainable urban water resources management. Smart metering schemes for
   end users have become an important strategy for water utilities to have
   an in-depth and fine-grained knowledge about urban water use. Beyond
   reducing certain labor costs, such as those related to manual meter
   reading, such detailed and continuous flow of information is said to
   enhance network efficiency and improve water planning by having more
   detailed demand patterns and forecasts. Research focusing on those
   initiatives has been very prolific in countries such as Australia.
   However, less academic attention has been paid to the development of
   smart metering in other geographies. This paper focuses on smart water
   metering in Spain and, more particularly, documents and reflects on the
   experience of the city of Alicante (southeastern Spain), a pioneer case
   of massive deployment of remote reading of water meters at the household
   level and for large urban customers. Through data and interviews with
   water managers from the water utility, we shed light on the costs and
   early benefits, as well as the potentialities and (unexpected) problems
   of this technology to contribute to more sustainable urban water cycles.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{The Digital Age has given impetus to new smart energy technology
   opportunities that are transformational and inspiring. However, a number
   of legal privacy and cybersecurity challenges present potential barriers
   to realizing these new economic, environmental and energy opportunities.
   This technological trend is best characterized as an
   energy-internet-of-things environment and is being driven by a rapid
   convergence and digitization of operational technology and information
   technology. This can be seen in the modernization of infrastructures,
   from power grids to smart cities, which increasingly weave together
   networked sensors and cyber and physical systems that enable big data to
   be collected, aggregated, exchanged, stored and monetized in new ways.
   This article explores and analyses these smart energy technology
   opportunities and challenges from a legal perspective, examining
   relevant privacy laws, torts and precedents, revealing some gaps in
   current privacy laws and cybersecurity regulations. Next, I analyse
   recent smart energy technology legislation passed in Europe and various
   states in the USA. Comparing and contrasting these laws in the European
   Union and USA is informative in their findings and different
   jurisdictional legal precedents. This analysis may provide valuable
   insight on how precedents on smart grid technology privacy and
   cybersecurity will establish future laws in jurisdictions where they are
   currently absent. These precedents and laws will also help inform
   evolving regulations, standards and legal precedents for
   internet-of-things technology that is woven into electricity
   infrastructure as part of grid modernizations efforts. While the legal
   literature outlining the challenges and potential solutions for privacy
   law and smart technology is at nascent stage, I conclude by listing a
   set of recommendations, which may apply ideas for future legal and
   scholarly research at the nexus of energy technology opportunities and
   legal privacy challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Bionic systems, connecting biological tissues with computer or robotic
   devices through brain-machine interfaces, can be used in various ways to
   discover biological mechanisms. In this article I outline and discuss a
   ``stimulation-connection{''} bionics-supported methodology for the study
   of the brain, and compare it with other epistemic uses of bionic systems
   described in the literature. This methododology differs from the
   ``synthetic{''}, simulative method often followed in theoretically
   driven Artificial Intelligence and cognitive (neuro) science, even
   though it involves machine models of biological systems. I also bring
   the previous analysis to bear on some claims on the epistemic value of
   bionic technologies made in the recent philosophical literature. I
   believe that the methodological reflections proposed here may contribute
   to the piecewise understanding of the many ways bionic technologies can
   be deployed not only to restore lost sensory-motor functions, but also
   to discover brain mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet is an important focus of attention for the philosophy of
   mind and cognitive science communities. This is partly because the
   Internet serves as an important part of the material environment in
   which a broad array of human cognitive and epistemic activities are
   situated. The Internet can thus be seen as an important part of the
   `cognitive ecology' that helps to shape, support and (on occasion)
   realize aspects of human cognizing. Much of the previous philosophical
   work in this area has sought to analyze the cognitive significance of
   the Internet from the perspective of human cognition. There has, as
   such, been little effort to assess the cognitive significance of the
   Internet from the perspective of `machine cognition'. This is
   unfortunate, because the Internet is likely to exert a significant
   influence on the shape of machine intelligence. The present paper
   attempts to evaluate the extent to which the Internet serves as a form
   of cognitive ecology for synthetic (machine-based) forms of
   intelligence. In particular, the phenomenon of Internet-situated machine
   intelligence is analyzed from the perspective of a number of approaches
   that are typically subsumed under the heading of situated cognition.
   These include extended, embedded, scaffolded and embodied approaches to
   cognition. For each of these approaches, the Internet is shown to be of
   potential relevance to the development and operation of machine-based
   cognitive capabilities. Such insights help us to appreciate the role of
   the Internet in advancing the current state-of-the-art in machine
   intelligence.}},

Abstract = {{The progression in several cognitive tests for the same subjects at
   different ages provides valuable information about their cognitive
   development. One question that has caught recent interest is whether the
   same approach can be used to assess the cognitive development of
   artificial systems. In particular, can we assess whether the `fluid' or
   `crystallised' intelligence of an artificial cognitive system is
   changing during its cognitive development as a result of acquiring more
   concepts? In this paper, we address several IQ tests problems
   (odd-one-out problems, Raven's Progressive Matrices and Thurstone's
   letter series) with a general learning system that is not particularly
   designed on purpose to solve intelligence tests. The goal is to better
   understand the role of the basic cognitive operational constructs (such
   as identity, difference, order, counting, logic, etc.) that are needed
   to solve these intelligence test problems and serve as a
   proof-of-concept for evaluation in other developmental problems. From
   here, we gain some insights into the characteristics and usefulness of
   these tests and how careful we need to be when applying human test
   problems to assess the abilities and cognitive development of robots and
   other artificial cognitive systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{For effective human-robot interaction, we argue that robots must gain
   social-cognitive mechanisms that allow them to function naturally and
   intuitively during social interactions with humans. However, a lack of
   consensus on social cognitive processes poses a challenge for how to
   design such mechanisms for artificial cognitive systems. We discuss a
   recent integrative perspective of social cognition to provide a
   systematic theoretical underpinning for computational instantiations of
   these mechanisms. We highlight several commitments of our approach that
   we refer to as Engineering Human Social Cognition. We then provide a
   series of recommendations to facilitate the development of the
   perceptual, motor, and cognitive architecture for this proposed
   artificial cognitive system in future work. For each recommendation, we
   highlight their relation to the discussed social-cognitive mechanisms,
   provide the rationale for these recommendations and potential benefits,
   and detail examples of associated computational formalisms that could be
   leveraged to instantiate our recommendations. Overall, the goal of this
   paper is to outline an interdisciplinary and multi-theoretic approach to
   facilitate the design of robots that will one day function, and be
   perceived, as socially interactive and effective teammates. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper investigates an intriguing question in the remote sensing
   field: ``can a machine generate humanlike language descriptions for a
   remote sensing image?{''} The automatic description of a remote sensing
   image (namely, remote sensing image captioning) is an important but
   rarely studied task for artificial intelligence. It is more challenging
   as the description must not only capture the ground elements of
   different scales, but also express their attributes as well as how these
   elements interact with each other. Despite the difficulties, we have
   proposed a remote sensing image captioning framework by leveraging the
   techniques of the recent fast development of deep learning and fully
   convolutional networks. The experimental results on a set of
   high-resolution optical images including Google Earth images and
   GaoFen-2 satellite images demonstrate that the proposed method is able
   to generate robust and comprehensive sentence description with desirable
   speed performance.}},

Abstract = {{Interdisciplinary research has been a focus in academia, and it is
   beneficial to understand the properties and structure of
   interdisciplinary research from the viewpoint of bibliometrics. This
   paper detects distinctions between publication categories and citation
   categories to measure the interdisciplinarity of individual
   publications, and then to measure interdisciplinarity for one research
   system by the average interdisciplinarity of individual publications,
   which are taken as elements in the research system. The average and the
   standard deviation (SD) that reflects the variance of the elements'
   interdisciplinarity in one research system, of all the publications'
   integration scores and diffusion scores, were then respectively
   calculated. Sixty of the most productive authors from three Web of
   Science categories (Mathematics, Applied; Computer Science, Artificial
   Intelligence; and Operations Research and Management Science) were
   selected as a case to validate our approach. The results showed that
   measuring the interdisciplinarity of individual elements effectively
   lessened the impacts caused by some elements with distinctive citation
   categories on the research system's interdisciplinarity (especially
   those research systems with large SDs). Furthermore, measuring the
   distinction between publication categories and citation categories is
   essential for individual publications' interdisciplinarity when the
   citation categories do not appear in the categories of the publication
   itself or the publication has only a single citation category.}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{In large industrial greenhouses, plants are usually treated following
   well established protocols for watering, nutrients, and shading/light.
   While this is practical for the automation of the process, it does not
   tap the full potential for optimal plant treatment. To more efficiently
   grow plants, specific treatments according to the plant individual needs
   should be applied. Experienced human gardeners are very good at treating
   plants individually. Unfortunately, hiring a crew of gardeners to carry
   out this task in large greenhouses is not cost effective. In this work
   we present a cognitive system that integrates artificial intelligence
   (AI) techniques for decision-making with robotics techniques for sensing
   and acting to autonomously treat plants using a real-robot platform.
   Artificial intelligence techniques are used to decide the amount of
   water and nutrients each plant needs according to the history of the
   plant. Robotic techniques for sensing measure plant attributes (e.g.
   leaves) from visual information using 3D model representations. These
   attributes are used by the AI system to make decisions about the
   treatment to apply. Acting techniques execute robot movements to supply
   the plants with the specified amount of water and nutrients. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{The 3-D integration helps improve performance and density of electronic
   systems. However, since electrical and thermal performance for 3-D
   integration is related to each other, their codesign is required.
   Machine learning, a promising approach in artificial intelligence, has
   recently shown promise for addressing engineering optimization problems.
   In this paper, we apply machine learning for the optimization of 3-D
   integrated systems where the electrical performance and thermal
   performance need to be analyzed together for maximizing performance. In
   such systems, modeling can be challenging due to the multiscale
   geometries involved, which increases computation time per iteration. In
   this paper, we show that machine learning can be applied to such systems
   where multiple parameters can be optimized to achieve the desired
   performance using the minimum number of iterations. These results have
   been compared with other promising optimization methods in this paper.
   The results show that on an average, 4.4\%, 31.1\%, and 6.9\%
   improvement in temperature gradient, CPU time, and skew are possible
   using machine learning, as compared with other methods.}},

Abstract = {{Two traditional recommendation techniques, content-based and
   collaborative filtering (CF), have been widely used in a broad range of
   domain areas. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and
   some of the defects can be resolved by integrating both techniques in a
   hybrid model to improve the quality of the recommendation. In this
   article, we will present a problem-oriented approach to design a hybrid
   immunizing solution for job recommendation problem from applicant's
   perspective. The proposed approach aims to recommend the best chances of
   opening jobs to the applicant who searches for job. It combines the
   artificial immune system (AIS), which has a powerful exploration
   capability in polynomial time, with the collaborative filtering, which
   can exploit the neighbors' interests. We will discuss the design issues,
   as well as the hybridization process that should be applied to the
   problem. Finally, experimental studies are conducted and the results
   show the importance of our approach for solving the job recommendation
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{Swarm intelligence (SI) optimization algorithms are fast and robust
   global optimization methods, and have attracted significant attention
   due to their ability to solve complex optimization problems. The
   underlying idea behind all SI algorithms is similar, and various SI
   algorithms differ only in their details. In this paper we discuss the
   algorithmic equivalence of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and various
   other newer SI algorithms, including the shuffled frog leaping algorithm
   (SFLA), the group search optimizer (GSO), the firefly algorithm (FA),
   artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) and the gravitational search
   algorithm (GSA). We find that the original versions of SFLA, GSO, FA,
   ABC, and GSA, are all algorithmically identical to PSO under certain
   conditions. We discuss their diverse biological motivations and
   algorithmic details as typically implemented, and show how their
   differences enhance the diversity of SI research and application. Then
   we numerically compare SFLA, GSO, FA, ABC, and GSA, with basic and
   advanced versions on some continuous benchmark functions and
   combinatorial knapsack problems. Empirical results show that an advanced
   version of ABC performs best on the continuous benchmark functions, and
   advanced versions of SFLA and GSA perform best on the combinatorial
   knapsack problems. We conclude that although these SI algorithms are
   conceptually equivalent, their implementation details result in notably
   different performance levels.}},

Abstract = {{Human-Robot Interaction challenges Artificial Intelligence in many
   regards: dynamic, partially unknown environments that were not
   originally designed for robots; a broad variety of situations with rich
   semantics to understand and interpret; physical interactions with humans
   that requires fine, low-latency yet socially acceptable control
   strategies; natural and multi-modal communication which mandates
   common-sense knowledge and the representation of possibly divergent
   mental models. This article is an attempt to characterise these
   challenges and to exhibit a set of key decisional issues that need to be
   addressed for a cognitive robot to successfully share space and tasks
   with a human. We identify first the needed individual and collaborative
   cognitive skills: geometric reasoning and situation assessment based on
   perspective-taking and affordance analysis; acquisition and
   representation of knowledge models for multiple agents (humans and
   robots, with their specificities); situated, natural and multi-modal
   dialogue; human aware task planning; human-robot joint task achievement.
   The article discusses each of these abilities, presents working
   implementations, and shows how they combine in a coherent and original
   deliberative architecture for human-robot interaction. Supported by
   experimental results, we eventually show how explicit knowledge
   management, both symbolic and geometric, proves to be instrumental to
   richer and more natural human robot interactions by pushing for
   pervasive, human-level semantics within the robot's deliberative system.

Abstract = {{The inclusion of robots in our society is imminent, such as service
   robots. Robots are now capable of reliably manipulating objects in our
   daily lives but only when combined with artificial intelligence (AI)
   techniques for planning and decision-making, which allow a machine to
   determine how a task can be completed successfully. To perform decision
   making, AI planning methods use a set of planning operators to code the
   state changes in the environment produced by a robotic action. Given a
   specific goal, the planner then searches for the best sequence of
   planning operators, i.e., the best plan that leads through the state
   space to satisfy the goal. In principle, planning operators can be hand
   -coded, but this is impractical for applications that involve many
   possible state transitions. An alternative is to learn them
   automatically from experience, which is most efficient when there is a
   human teacher. In this study, we propose a simple and efficient decision
   making framework for this purpose. The robot executes its plan in a
   step-wise manner and any planning impasse produced by missing operators
   is resolved online by asking a human teacher for the next action to
   execute. Based on the observed state transitions, this approach rapidly
   generates the missing operators by evaluating the relevance of several
   cause effect alternatives in parallel using a probability estimate,
   which compensates for the high uncertainty that is inherent when
   learning from a small number of samples. We evaluated the validity of
   our approach in simulated and real environments, where it was
   benchmarked against previous methods. Humans learn in the same
   incremental manner, so we consider that our approach may be a better
   alternative to existing learning paradigms, which require offline
   learning, a significant amount of previous knowledge, or a large number
   of samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Planners developed in the Artificial Intelligence community assume that
   tasks in the task plans they generate will be executed predictably and
   reliably. This assumption provides a useful abstraction in that it lets
   the task planners focus on what tasks should be done, while lower-level
   motion planners and controllers take care of the details of how the task
   should be performed. While this assumption is useful in many domains, it
   becomes problematic when controlling physically embedded systems, where
   there are often delays, disturbances, and failures. The task plans do
   not provide enough information about allowed flexibility in task
   duration and hybrid state evolution. Such flexibility could be useful
   when deciding how to react to disturbances. An important domain where
   this gap has caused problems is robotics, particularly, the operation of
   robots in unstructured, uncertain environments. Due to the complexity of
   this domain, the demands of tasks to be performed, and the actuation
   limits of robots, knowledge about permitted flexibility in execution of
   a task is crucial. We address this gap through two key innovations.
   First, we specify a Qualitative State Plan (QSP), which supports
   representation of spatial and temporal flexibility with respect to
   tasks. Second, we extend compilation approaches developed for temporally
   flexible execution of discrete activity plans to work with hybrid
   discrete/continuous systems using a recently developed Linear Quadratic
   Regulator synthesis algorithm, which performs a state reachability
   analysis to prune infeasible trajectories, and which determines optimal
   control policies for feasible state regions. The resulting Model-based
   Executive is able to take advantage of spatial and temporal flexibility
   in a QSP to improve handling of disturbances. Note that in this work, we
   focus on execution of QSPs, and defer the problem of how they are
   generated. We believe the latter could be accomplished through
   extensions to existing task planners. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Autonomous robots that are to perform complex everyday tasks such as
   making pancakes have to understand how the effects of an action depend
   on the way the action is executed. Within Artificial Intelligence,
   classical planning reasons about whether actions are executable, but
   makes the assumption that the actions will succeed (with some
   probability). In this work, we have designed, implemented, and analyzed
   a framework that allows us to envision the physical effects of robot
   manipulation actions. We consider envisioning to be a qualitative
   reasoning method that reasons about actions and their effects based on
   simulation-based projections. Thereby it allows a robot to infer what
   could happen when it performs a task in a certain way. This is achieved
   by translating a qualitative physics problem into a parameterized
   simulation problem; performing a detailed physics-based simulation of a
   robot plan; logging the state evolution into appropriate data
   structures; and then translating these sub-symbolic data structures into
   interval-based first-order symbolic, qualitative representations, called
   timelines. The result of the envisioning is a set of detailed narratives
   represented by timelines which are then used to infer answers to
   qualitative reasoning problems. By envisioning the outcome of actions
   before committing to them, a robot is able to reason about physical
   phenomena and can therefore prevent itself from ending up in unwanted
   situations. Using this approach, robots can perform manipulation tasks
   more efficiently, robustly, and flexibly, and they can even successfully
   accomplish previously unknown variations of tasks. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The correct and consistent identification of the petrographic properties
   of coal is an important issue for researchers in the fields of mining
   and geology. As part of the study described in this paper,
   investigations concerning the application of artificial intelligence
   methods for the identification of the aforementioned characteristics
   were carried out. The methods in question were used to identify the
   maceral groups of coal, i.e. vitrinite, inertinite, and liptinite.
   Additionally, an attempt was made to identify some non-organic minerals.
   The analyses were performed using pattern recognition techniques (NN,
   kNN), as well as artificial neural network techniques (a multilayer
   perceptron - MLP). The classification process was carried out using
   microscopy images of polished sections of coals. A multidimensional
   feature space was defined, which made it possible to classify the
   discussed structures automatically, based on the methods of pattern
   recognition and algorithms of the artificial neural networks. Also, from
   the study we assessed the impact of the parameters for which the applied
   methods proved effective upon the final outcome of the classification
   procedure. The result of the analyses was a high percentage (over 97\%)
   of correct classifications of maceral groups and mineral components. The
   paper discusses also an attempt to analyze particular macerals of the
   inertinite group. It was demonstrated that using artificial neural
   networks to this end makes it possible to classify the macerals properly

Title = {{A Pareto-optimal moving average-multigene genetic programming model for

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of genetic programming (GP) in rainfall-runoff
   modelling has been recognized in recent studies. However, it may produce
   misleading estimations if autoregressive relationship between runoff and
   its antecedent values is not carefully considered. Meanwhile, GP evolves
   alternative models of different accuracy and complexity, where selecting
   a parsimonious model from such alternatives needs extra attention. To
   cope with these problems, this paper proposes a new hybrid model that
   integrates moving average filtering with multigene GP and uses
   Pareto-front plot to optimize the evolved models through an interactive
   complexity-efficiency trade-off. The model was applied to develop
   single- and multi-day-ahead rainfall-runoff models and compared to
   stand-alone GP, multigene GP, and multilayer perceptron as the
   benchmarks. The results indicated that the new model provides
   substantial improvements relative to the benchmarks, with prediction
   errors 25-60\% lower and timing accuracy 80 -760\% higher. Moreover, it
   is explicit and parsimonious, motivating to be used in practice. (C)

Abstract = {{All enterprises are concerned with employee turnover risk due to the
   significant impact on their effectiveness and competitiveness.
   Evaluation of the risk is a frequent topic in the literature. However,
   the majority of past work has not incorporated the advancement of modern
   information technology, particularly in the era of Internet of Things
   (IoT). In this paper, we propose to use an artificial intelligence
   method, case-based reasoning (CBR), to develop a multi-level employee
   turnover risk evaluation model. The proposed model adopts multiple CBR
   techniques including case representation, organization and management,
   and retrieval and matching to evaluate employee turnover risk.
   Specifically, we employ an object-oriented method in case knowledge
   expressing, utilize relational database in case organization and
   management, and follow a tree-hash algorithm to retrieve the best cases.
   Both theoretical and practical implications of the proposed model are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Automated semantic web service composition is one of the critical
   research challenges of service-oriented computing, since it allows users
   to create an application simply by specifying the inputs that the
   application requires, the outputs it should produce, and any constraints
   it should respect. The composition problem has been handled using a
   variety of techniques, from artificial intelligence planning to
   optimization algorithms. However no approach so far has focused on
   handling three composition dimensions simultaneously, producing
   solutions that are: (1) fully functional (i.e., fully executable) by
   using a mechanism of semantic matching between the services involved in
   the solutions, (2) are optimized according to non-functional
   quality-of-service (QoS) measurements, and (3) respect global QoS
   constraints. This paper presents a novel approach based on a Harmony
   Search algorithm that addresses these three dimensions simultaneously
   through a fitness function, to select the optimal or near-optimal
   solution in semantic web service composition. In our approach, the
   search space is modeled as a planning-graph structure which encodes all
   the possible composition solutions for a given user request. To improve
   the selection process we have compared the original Harmony Search
   algorithm with its recently developed variants Improved Harmony Search
   (IHS) algorithm and Global Best Harmony Search (GHS) algorithm. An
   experimentation of the approach conducted with an extended version of
   the Web Service Challenge 2009 dataset showed that: (1) our approach is
   efficient and effective to extract the optimal or near-optimal
   composition in diverse scenarios; and (2) both variants IHS and GHS
   algorithms have brought improvements in terms of fitness and execution
   time.}},

Abstract = {{The development of autonomous energy systems has been accompanied by a
   number of challenges related to the specific characteristics of these
   systems, such as power flow control, development of protection systems
   respecting the dynamic changes in short-circuit power and the issue of
   compliance with power quality parameters. To keep the power quality
   parameters of electrical energy in Off-Grid systems within the limit is
   highly complicated with regards to the supply of electrical energy from
   renewable sources of a stochastic nature, which are used as dominant
   sources of electric or heat energy. Variations in short-circuit power
   may significantly affect the system stability and may have a negative
   impact on the operation in case of sensitive appliances. We developed
   tools and methods to keep the power quality parameters in Off-Grid
   systems within the limits using an intelligent approach based on an
   artificial intelligence technique. Our computational model is able to
   predict disturbances in power quality and perform a set of proper
   reactions to avoid such disturbances with over 60\% success rate in time
   horizon of 15 min ahead. As a result, it is subsequently possible to
   optimize the operation of Off-Grid systems and thus contribute to
   improvements in the power quality parameters in Off-Grid systems. (C)

Title = {{Developing Emotion-Aware, Advanced Learning Technologies: A Taxonomy of

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{A growing body of work on intelligent tutoring systems, affective
   computing, and artificial intelligence in education is exploring
   creative, technology-driven approaches to enhance learners' experience
   of adaptive, positively-valenced emotions while interacting with
   advanced learning technologies. Despite this, there has been no
   published work to date that captures this topic's breadth. We took up
   this grand challenge by integrating related empirical studies and
   existing conceptual work and proposing a theoretically-guided taxonomy
   for the development and improvement of emotion-aware systems. In
   particular, multiple strategies system developers may use to help
   learners experience positive emotions are mapped out, including those
   that require different amounts and types of information about the user,
   as well as when this information is required. Examples from the
   literature are provided to illustrate how different emotion-aware system
   approaches can be combined to take advantage of different types of data,
   both prior to and during the learner-system interaction. High-level
   system features that emotion-aware systems can tailor to learners in
   order to elicit positive emotions are also described and exemplified.
   Theoretically, the taxonomy is primarily informed by the control-value
   theory of achievement emotions (Pekrun 2006, 2011) and its assumptions
   about the relationship between distal and proximal antecedents and the
   elicitation and regulation of emotion. The taxonomy expands upon a
   dichotomy of emotion-aware systems proposed by D'Mello and Graesser
   (2015) and is intended to guide the design of emotion-aware systems that
   can foster positive emotions during learner-system interactions through
   the use of varied approaches, data sources, and design features.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an interactive museum exhibit featuring an avatar
   of Alan Turing that informs museum visitors about artificial
   intelligence and Turing's seminal Turing Test for machine intelligence.
   The objective of the exhibit is to engage and motivate visiting children
   in the hope of sparking an interest in them about computer science and
   artificial intelligence, and cause them to consider pursuing future
   studies and/or careers in these fields. The exhibit interacts with the
   visitors, allowing them to participate in a simplified version of
   Turing's test that is brief and informal to suit the limitations of a
   five-minute exhibit. In this exhibit, the visitor (targeted towards
   middle school age children) invokes an avatar of his/her own choice, and
   acts to endow it with human-like qualities (voice, brain, eyesight and
   hearing). Then, the visitor engages the avatar in a (brief)
   question-and-answer session to determine whether the visitor thinks that
   he/she is interacting with a real human on a video conference or with an
   avatar. We consider this interaction to be an extension of the original
   Turing Test because, unlike Turing's original that used text via a
   teletype, this version features a graphical embodiment of an agent with
   which one can converse in spoken natural language. This extension serves
   to make passing the Turing Test more difficult, as now the avatar must
   not only communicate like a human, but also look, sound and act the
   part. It also makes the exhibit visual, dynamic and interesting to the
   visitors. Evaluations were performed with museum visitors, both in
   backrooms with prototypes as well as on the museum floor with the final
   version. The formative and summative evaluations performed indicated
   overall success in engaging the museum visitors and increasing their
   interest in computer science. More specifically, the formative testing,
   mostly done in quiet back rooms with selected test subjects, indicated
   that on the important questions about enjoyment of exhibit and increased
   interest in computer science by the test subjects, their self-reported
   Likert scale responses (1 being negative and 5 being positive) increased
   from 3.16 in the first evaluation to 4.38 in the third one for increased
   interest in CS. Likewise for the question about exhibit enjoyment (from
   3.92 to 4.56). The summative evaluation, done through unobtrusive
   observation of exhibit use on museum floor, indicated that almost 74\%
   of the parties that initiated the exhibit were either highly or
   moderately engaged by the exhibit. However, there was one major negative
   finding, namely the overly long duration of the exhibit, which may have
   caused premature abandonment of the exhibit in several cases during the
   summative evaluation. These tests and their results are presented and
   discussed in detail in this paper. The exhibit has been on permanent
   display at the Orlando (FL) Science Center since June 2014 and has
   received a strongly positive response from visitors since that time.}},

Abstract = {{A precise alignment between point-to-point free space optical (FSO)
   networks is crucial in order to maximize the performance of data
   transmission. A sway or low-frequency vibration of FSO base station can
   affect line-of-sight quality and hence may lead to the occurrence of
   higher BER. Therefore, the work presented in this paper is to
   demonstrate an improved auto-alignment single-channel FSO transmission
   system at X-axis detection area. The receiver base station was fed with
   pulsed signal laser from a tunable laser source with a central
   wavelength of 1550 nm. The detection mechanism responds from an analog
   input signal received that corresponds to the X-axis direction of
   transmitter vibration. The detection performance of the system was
   observed by using two approaches: auto-searching of artificial
   intelligence (AI) detection with stop command and without stop command.
   The obtained results indicate that the bit sequence of the pulsed signal
   has low loss by implementing the auto-searching of AI detection with
   stop command features and hence improves the efficiency of the overall
   FSO transmission system.}},

Abstract = {{Learning automata (LA) as a powerful tool for reinforcement learning
   which belongs to the subject of Artificial Intelligence, could search
   for the optimal state adaptively in a random environment. In the past
   decades quite a few FALA algorithms are maturely developed but exposing
   critical defects, when they are applied to optimize continuous
   functions. In order to overcome their shortcomings and explore a
   higher-performance LA, we propose a novel CALA algorithm to solve the
   function optimization problems via one kind of LA prototypes, i.e, the
   continuous action-set reinforcement learning automata, which is
   abbreviated as CARLA. The key mechanism of the proposed algorithm lies
   in a combination of equidistant discretization and linear interpolation.
   Specifically, four categories of application models are constructed. Two
   of them are created to obtain continuous actions when the priori
   information is finite ones, thus avoiding the drawbacks of FALA. The
   realization of this functionality recourses to the so-called cumulative
   distribution function (CDF) and a new concept of area surrounded by
   curves (AsbC) respectively. The other two models are modified versions
   to balance the trade-off between accuracy and speed. Moreover, these
   models are expanded to their generalized versions so that
   multidimensional function optimization problems can be handled as well.
   A massive amount of experiments including four benchmarks and three
   scenarios are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
   of the proposed application models. The proposed algorithm outperforms
   the state of the arts of LA as well as optimization algorithms, with a
   high accuracy rate, a fast convergence speed, and a competitive time
   consumption, especially in noised environments.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the microcomputer performs calculations at an incredibly high
   rate of billions of instructions per second. That represents an
   exponential increase in the processing speed since the early days of the
   computer development, eventhough such growth did not show complex
   reasoning that even the simple biological organisms can make. The
   artificial intelligence techniques as an attempt to work about those
   limitations, are a promising alternative.
   Each intelligent technique has its particular strengths and weaknesses
   and cannot be universally implemented to any problem. Mixed together,
   these techniques can improve the solutions quality and allow application
   to various tasks. It is the reason why the AI is used increasingly in
   order to solve complex problems in engineering. Where, it is still
   necessary to make progress in the controller tuning.
   The idea proposed in this paper is simple and original. It is the result
   of a study that compared the performances of two controls based on the
   artificial intelligence techniques: the artificial neural networks and
   the fuzzy logic. The control proposed in this paper combines in a
   different manner these two techniques in the form of a hybrid control.
   The aim is to benefit from performances of each of these techniques, by
   using them in the same control block at the most suitable place.
   The performances of the this proposed hybrid control; applied to the
   three-phase induction motor supplied by voltage source inverter; are
   investigated and compared to those obtained from the controls based on
   artificial neural networks; fuzzy logic and conventional techniques. The
   results of simulation show the feasibility and the good performances
   achieved by the proposed control. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{436-451}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Symbolic circuit analysis inherits the exponential growth of transfer
   function complexity with the circuit size. Therefore, symbolic
   simplification is an NP-hard problem. Although many simplification
   techniques have been presented, the simplified transfer functions are
   not written in a factorized form, and consequently, it is difficult to
   assess the contribution of poles and zeros on the circuit behavior. In
   this paper, a swarm intelligence based methodology is presented for the
   simplified factorized symbolic analysis of analog circuits. In this
   method, an extension of the root splitting technique is utilized to
   rewrite the expanded transfer function of the circuit into a factorized
   form comprising DC-gain, poles, and zeros. Then, the derived factorized
   transfer function is simplified using a hybrid Global and Local search
   algorithm based on Artificial Bee Colony and Simulated Annealing (named
   GLABCSA). The objective function is defined to minimize the complexity
   of the symbolic factorized transfer function while minimizing the
   DC-gain error and pole/zero displacements. The presented approach has
   been successfully developed in MATLAB. The program can derive the
   simplified factorized symbolic transfer function automatically from the
   input text netlist of the circuit. Symbolic and numerical results over
   two analog amplifiers are given to illustrate the efficiency of the
   presented methodology. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{267-277}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A contract algorithm is an algorithm which is given, as part of its
   input, a specified amount of allowable computation time, and may not
   return useful results if interrupted prior to that time. In contrast, an
   interruptible algorithm will always output some meaningful (albeit
   suboptimal) solution, even if interrupted during its execution.
   Simulating interruptible algorithms by means of schedules of executions
   of contract algorithms in parallel processors is a well-studied problem
   with significant applications in AI. In the standard model, the
   interruptions are hard deadlines in which a solution must be reported
   immediately at the time the interruption occurs. In this paper, we study
   the more general setting of scheduling contract algorithms in the
   presence of soft deadlines. In particular, we address the setting in
   which if an interruption occurs at time t, then the system is given an
   additional window of time , for constant c, within which the simulation
   must be completed. We formulate extensions to performance measures of
   schedules under this setting and derive schedules of optimal performance
   for all concave functions w.}},

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},

Pages = {{42-51}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{To enhance the performance of an integrated Global Positioning System
   and Inertial Navigation System (GPS/INS) during GPS outages, a novel
   hybrid fusion algorithm is proposed to provide a pseudo position
   information to assist the integrated navigation system. A new model that
   directly relates the velocity, angular rate and specific force of INS to
   the increments of the GPS position is established. Combined with a
   Kalman filter and an improved Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network, the
   hybrid system is able to predict and estimate a pseudo GPS position when
   GPS signal is unavailable. Field test data are collected to
   experimentally evaluate the proposed model. The comparison results show:
   (1) the proposed model can effectively provide corrections to standalone
   INS during the 300s GPS outages, which also outperforms some of the
   widely used models; (2) our improved MLP method achieves better
   performance in the prediction of GPS position information than the
   normal artificial neural network (ANN) trained by Bayesian
   Regularization; (3) the best result can be reached when the current and
   past 1-step information of INS is utilized as the inputs of the

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{186-198}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present research work is two folded. First, it is
   intended to describe the development of a low cost force measurement
   setup for friction stir welding (FSW) process and second, is to
   demonstrate the potential of force signals combined with artificial
   intelligence to accurately predict ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and
   yield strength of the joints. In FSW process, simultaneous rotation, and
   translation of the tool associated with severe plastic deformation of
   material around the tool pin brings challenges in measurement of torque
   and forces experienced during welding. An attempt has been made to
   design and develop a strain gauge based setup for the measurement of two
   dimensional forces and torque during FSW process. The force signals
   acquired using the developed setup is then utilized to develop support
   vector regression based data driven models for prediction of UTS and
   yield strength of the welded samples. For monitoring the FSW process a
   new statistical indicator derived from force signals is presented. The
   proposed indicator brings appreciable correlation with the UTS of the
   joints. The prediction performances of the developed models imply that
   the presented approach can be effectively put forward for real time
   monitoring of the process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of semantic place categorization in mobile

   multi-class semantic classification is performed by a DBMM composed of a
   mixture of heterogeneous base classifiers, using geometrical features
   computed from 2D laserscanner data, where the sensor is mounted on-board
   a moving robot operating indoors. Besides its capability to combine
   different probabilistic classifiers, the DBMM approach also incorporates
   time-based (dynamic) inferences in the form of previous
   class-conditional probabilities and priors. Extensive experiments were
   carried out on publicly available benchmark datasets, highlighting the
   influence of the number of time-slices and the effect of additive
   smoothing on the classification performance of the proposed approach.
   Reported results, under different scenarios and conditions, show the

   neighbours (k-NN) approach and employs snow-meteorological variables to
   search for past days with similar conditions. The events associated with
   past similar days are then analysed to generate forecast. The model is
   required to be calibrated regularly to ensure higher degree of forecast
   accuracy in terms of Heidke skill score (HSS). The calibration of eNN10
   is carried out by Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, a swarm
   intelligence driven population based metaheuristic algorithm, and it
   requires thousands of HSS evaluations during the complete calibration
   process. A MATLAB sequential code for calibration runs for over 400
   minutes and the proposed methodology delivered about 10 x acceleration
   in calibration process. The methodology combines primitives of parallel
   implementations of brute force k-NN algorithm with that of population
   based metaheuristic algorithms and is scalable to deal with other
   similar real-world problems. The major objective of this paper is to
   highlight the methodology and associated future research areas. (C) 2017

Title = {{Realistic action recognition with salient foreground trajectories}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{44-55}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Human action recognition has great potential in many applications
   relevant to artificial intelligence, which can accelerate some research
   on expert and intelligent systems, such as feature selection. To improve
   the performance on human action recognition in realistic scenarios, a
   novel Salient Foreground Trajectory extraction method based on saliency
   detection and low-rank matrix recovery is proposed to learn the
   discriminative features from complicated video context. Specifically, a
   new trajectory saliency combining appearance saliency and motion
   saliency is proposed to divide the dense trajectories into salient
   trajectories and non-salient ones. The salient trajectories are
   approximately corresponding to the interested foreground region, while
   the non-salient subset is mainly composed of the dominating background
   trajectories. Furthermore, according to the low rank property of
   background motion, if the video has background motion, the background
   trajectory subspace is further constructed on the non-salient trajectory
   subset via low-rank matrix recovery method. Then the possible background
   trajectories in the salient subset could be subtracted. Finally, the
   resulting salient foreground trajectory features are encoded by the
   approach of Bag of Features or Fisher Vector for action classification.
   Experiments on KTH, UCF Sports and Olympic Sports have shown that the
   proposed Salient Foreground Trajectory method is effective and achieves
   comparable results to the state of the art. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Identifying students' learning styles has several benefits such as
   making students aware of their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to
   learning and the possibility to personalize their learning environment
   to their learning styles. While there exist learning style
   questionnaires for identifying a student's learning style, such
   questionnaires have several disadvantages and therefore, research has
   been conducted on automatically identifying learning styles from
   students' behavior in a learning environment. Current approaches to
   automatically identify learning styles have an average precision between
   66\% and 77\%, which shows the need for improvements in order to use
   such automatic approaches reliably in learning environments. In this
   paper, four computational intelligence algorithms (artificial neural
   network, genetic algorithm, ant colony system and particle swarm
   optimization) have been investigated with respect to their potential to
   improve the precision of automatic learning style identification. Each
   algorithm was evaluated with data from 75 students. The artificial
   neural network shows the most promising results with an average
   precision of 80.7\%, followed by particle swarm optimization with an
   average precision of 79.1\%. Improving the precision of automatic
   learning style identification allows more students to benefit from more
   accurate information about their learning styles as well as more
   accurate personalization towards accommodating their learning styles in
   a learning environment. Furthermore, teachers can have a better
   understanding of their students and be able to provide more appropriate
   interventions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pervasiveness of ubiquitous computing advances the manufacturing scheme
   into a ubiquitous manufacturing era which poses significant challenges
   on sensing technology and system reliability. To improve manufacturing
   system reliability, this paper presents a new virtual tool wear sensing
   technique based on multisensory data fusion and artificial intelligence
   model for tool condition monitoring. It infers the difficult-to-measure
   tool wear parameters (e.g. tool wear width) by fusing in-process
   multisensory data (e.g. force, vibration, etc.) with dimension reduction
   technique and support vector regression model. Different
   state-of-the-art dimension reduction techniques including kernel
   principal component analysis, locally linear embedding, isometric
   feature mapping, and minimum redundancy maximum relevant method have
   been investigated for feature fusion in a virtual sensing model, and the
   kernel principal component analysis performs best in terms of sensing
   accuracy. The effectiveness of the developed virtual tool wear sensing
   technique is experimentally validated in a set of machining tool
   run-to-failure tests on a computer numerical control milling machine.
   The results show that the estimated tool wear width through virtual
   sensing is comparable to that measured offline by a microscope
   instrument in terms of accuracy, moreover, in a more cost-effective
   manner. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial Bee Colony inspired by the foraging behaviour of honey bees
   is a novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm in the community of
   swarm intelligence algorithms. Nevertheless, it is still insufficient in
   the speed of convergence and the quality of solutions. This paper
   proposes an approach in order to tackle these downsides by combining the
   positive aspects of Teaching-Learning based optimization and Artificial
   Bee Colony. The performance of the proposed method is assessed on the
   software effort estimation problem, which is the complex and important
   issue in the project management. Software developers often carry out the
   software estimation in the early stages of the software development life
   cycle to derive the required cost and schedule for a project. There are
   a large number of methods for effort estimation in which COCOMO II is
   one of the most widely used models. However, this model has some
   restricts because its parameters have not been optimized yet. In this
   work, therefore, we will present the approach to overcome this
   limitation of COCOMO II model. The experiments have been conducted on
   NASA software project dataset and the obtained results indicated that
   the improvement of parameters provided better estimation capabilities

Abstract = {{Glycol based conventional fluids are generally used as coolants and
   anti-freezing agents in industrial applications. Thus, this paper
   explores the possibility of utilizing DES as a heat transfer fluid due
   to their enhanced thermal stability compared to conventional fluids.
   Thermal conductivity of four types of DES comprising of methyl
   triphenyl-phosphonium-bromide (MTPB) and choline chloride (ChCl) as
   salts, and ethylene glycol (EG) and triethylene glycol (TEG) as the
   hydrogen bond donor (HBD), are measured from 25 degrees C to 50 degrees
   C using KD2 Pro thermal properties analyser. The obtained results show
   that the presence of salt lowers the thermal conductivity of the pure
   organic fluids. As the temperature increases, the thermal conductivity
   of the DESs increase compared to the thermal conductivity of pure
   organic solvents that does not change with temperaure. At higher
   temperature (50 degrees C), the thermal conductivity decreased by 9.9\%
   for MTPB: EG-DES, 5.4\% for MTPB: TEG-DES and 5.4\% for ChCl: EG-DESs.
   In addition to the thermal conductivity, the viscosity of the DES was
   also measured and found to be higher than the pure organic solvents. DES
   synthesized from MTPB salt shows higher viscosity as compared to ChCl
   due to higher hydrogen bonding between the salt and HBD. As the
   temperature increases, the viscosity of the DES converges closer to the
   viscosity of the pure organic fluids. Therefore, DES at high temperature
   will pose negligible increase in pumping power. With the addition of
   salt, the DES has lower freezing point compared to the pure EG and TEG
   due to the highly energetic hydrogen bonding.}},

Abstract = {{Normally, the artificial intelligence algorithms are widely applied to
   the optimal controller design. Then, it is expected that the best output
   performance is achieved. Unfortunately, when resulting controller
   parameters are implemented by using the practical devices, the output
   performance cannot be the best as expected. Therefore, the paper
   presents the optimal controller design using the combination between the
   state-space averaging model and the adaptive Tabu search algorithm with
   the new criteria as two penalty conditions to handle the mentioned
   problem. The buck-boost converter regulated by the cascade PI
   controllers is used as the example power system. The results show that
   the output performance is better than those from the conventional design
   method for both input and load variations. Moreover, it is confirmed
   that the reported controllers can be implemented using the realistic
   devices without the limitation and the stable operation is also
   guaranteed. The results are also validated by the simulation using the
   topology model of MATLAB and also experimentally verified by the testing
   rig.}},

Abstract = {{Intelligent fault detection in induction motors (IMs) is a widely
   studied research topic. Various artificial-intelligence-based approaches
   have been proposed to deal with a large amount of data obtained from
   destructive laboratory testing. However, in real applications, such
   volume of data is not always available due to the effort required in
   obtaining the predictors for classifying the faults. Therefore, in
   realistic scenarios, it is necessary to cope with the small-data
   problem, as it is known in the literature. Fault-related instances along
   with healthy state observations obtained from the IM compose datasets
   that are usually imbalanced, where the number of instances classified as
   the faulty class (minority) is much lower than those classified under
   the healthy class (majority). This paper presents a novel supervised
   classification approach for IM faults based on the adaptive boosting
   algorithm with an optimized sampling technique that deals with the
   imbalanced experimental dataset. The stator current signal is used to
   compose a dataset with features both from the time domain and from the
   frequency domain. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
   approach achieves higher performance metrics than others classifiers
   used in this field for the incipient detection and classification of
   faults in IM.}},

Abstract = {{The design of technical instrumentation based on biological principles,
   which are utilized by human perception senses to interact with the
   environment, has been a principal subject of research in several
   engineering disciplines for decades. However, only some of these
   artificial senses, such as machine vision, have comparatively reached a
   sufficient level of maturity so as to allow their regular use in
   nowadays industry. The challenge of artificially replicating the
   biological olfactory sense has resulted in the development of compact
   electronic systems commonly known as electronic noses or e-noses. These
   systems require, on the one hand, the use of specifically designed
   sensors for detecting odors, and secondly, the application of artificial
   intelligence software techniques for data processing and classification
   in a real-time basis. In this paper, a novel artificial olfaction system
   based on web services is introduced. The proposed system provides online
   odour data processing and recognition capabilities, regardless of e-nose
   location and built-in sensors, thus facilitating the design of smaller,
   generic or specific e-noses, which are suitable for use in connected IT
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{The natural way to use Answer Set Programming (ASP) to represent
   knowledge in Artificial Intelligence or to solve a combinatorial problem
   is to elaborate a first-order logic program with default negation. In a
   preliminary step, this program with variables is translated in an
   equivalent propositional one by a first tool: the grounder. Then, the
   propositional program is given to a second tool: the solver. This last
   one computes (if they exist) one or many answer sets (stable models) of
   the program, each answer set encoding one solution of the initial
   problem. Until today, almost all ASP systems apply this two steps
   computation. In this article, the project ASPeRiX is presented as a
   first-order forward chaining approach for Answer Set Computing. This
   project was among the first to introduce an approach of answer set
   computing that escapes the preliminary phase of rule instantiation by
   integrating it in the search process. The methodology applies a forward
   chaining of first-order rules that are grounded on the fly by means of
   previously produced atoms. Theoretical foundations of the approach are
   presented, the main algorithms of the ASP solver ASPeRiX are detailed
   and some experiments and comparisons with existing systems are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Microbotryum silybum is a smut fungus infecting Silybum marianum (milk
   thistle) weed and is currently investigated as a means for its
   biological control. Although the fungus' detection is important for the
   evaluation of biological control effectiveness and decision making,
   in-situ diagnosis is not always possible. The presented approach
   describes the identification of systemically infected S. marianum plants
   by using field spectroscopy and hierarchical self-organizing maps. An
   experimental field that contained both healthy and artificially
   inoculated S. marianum plants was used to acquire leaf spectra using a
   handheld visible and near-infrared spectrometer (310-1100 nm). Three
   supervised hierarchical self-organizing models, including Supervised
   Kohonen Network (SKN), Counter propagation Artificial Neural Network
   (CP-ANN) and XY-Fusion network (XY-F) were utilized for the
   identification of the systemically infected S. marianum plants. As input
   features to the classifiers, the pre-processed spectral signatures were
   used. The pre-processing of the spectra included normalisation, second
   derivative and principal component extraction. The systemically infected
   S. marianum identification rates using SKN and CP-ANN reached high
   overall accuracy (up to 90\%) and even higher using the XY-F (95.16\%).
   The results demonstrate the potential for a high accuracy identification
   of systemically infected S. marianum plants during vegetative growth,
   with the assistance of hierarchical self-organizing maps. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Flow pattern recognition is necessary to select design equations for
   finding operating details of the process and to perform computational
   simulations. Visual image processing can be used to automate the
   interpretation of patterns in two-phase flow. In this paper, an attempt
   has been made to improve the classification accuracy of the flow pattern
   of gas/liquid two-phase flow using fuzzy logic and Support Vector
   Machine (SVM) with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The videos of six
   different types of flow patterns namely, annular flow, bubble flow,
   churn flow, plug flow, slug flow and stratified flow are recorded for a
   period and converted to 2D images for processing. The textural and shape
   features extracted using image processing are applied as inputs to
   various classification schemes namely fuzzy logic, SVM and SVM with PCA
   in order to identify the type of flow pattern. The results obtained are
   compared and it is observed that SVM with features reduced using PCA
   gives the better classification accuracy and computationally less
   intensive than other two existing schemes. This study results cover
   industrial application needs including oil and gas and any other
   gas-liquid two-phase flows. (C) 2017 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In artificial intelligence, it is important to handle and analyse
   inconsistency in knowledge bases. Inconsistent pieces of information
   suggest questions like ``where is the inconsistency?{''} and ``how
   severe is it?{''}. Inconsistency measures have been proposed to tackle
   the latter issue, but the former seems underdeveloped and is the focus
   of this paper. Minimal inconsistent sets have been the main tool to
   localise inconsistency, but we argue that they are like the exposed part
   of an iceberg, failing to capture contradictions hidden under the water.
   Using classical propositional logic, we develop methods to characterise
   when a formula is contributing to the inconsistency in a knowledge base
   and when a set of formulas can be regarded as a primitive conflict. To
   achieve this, we employ an abstract consequence operation to ``look
   beneath the water level{''}, generalising the minimal inconsistent set
   concept and the related free formula notion. We apply the framework
   presented to the problem of measuring inconsistency in knowledge bases,
   putting forward relaxed forms for two debatable postulates for
   inconsistency measures. Finally, we discuss the computational complexity
   issues related to the introduced concepts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The simulation of mathematical reasoning has been a driving force
   throughout the history of Artificial Intelligence research. However,
   despite significant successes in computer mathematics, computers are not
   widely used by mathematicians apart from their quotidian applications.
   An oft-cited reason for this is that current computational systems
   cannot do mathematics in the way that humans do. We draw on two areas in
   which Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is currently unlike human
   mathematics: firstly in a focus on soundness, rather than
   understandability of proof, and secondly in social aspects. Employing
   techniques and tools from argumentation to build a framework for mixed
   initiative collaboration, we develop three complementary arcs. In the
   first arc - our theoretical model - we interpret the informal logic of
   mathematical discovery proposed by Lakatos, a philosopher of
   mathematics, through the lens of dialogue game theory and in particular
   as a dialogue game ranging over structures of argumentation. In our
   second arc - our abstraction level - we develop structured arguments,
   from which we induce abstract argumentation systems and compute the
   argumentation semantics to provide labelings of the acceptability status
   of each argument. The output from this stage corresponds to a final, or
   currently accepted proof artefact, which can be viewed alongside its
   historical development. Finally, in the third arc - our computational
   model - we show how each of these formal steps is available in
   implementation. In an appendix, we demonstrate our approach with a
   formal, implemented example of real-world mathematical collaboration. We
   conclude the paper with reflections on our mixed-initiative
   collaborative approach. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In many cases several entities, such as commercial companies, need to
   work together towards the achievement of joint goals, while hiding
   certain private information. To collaborate effectively, some sort of
   plan is needed to coordinate the different entities. We address the
   problem of automatically generating such a coordination plan while
   preserving the agents' privacy. Maintaining privacy is challenging when
   planning for multiple agents, especially when tight collaboration is
   needed and a global high-level view of the plan is required. In this
   work we present the Greedy Privacy-Preserving Planner (GPPP), a privacy
   preserving planning algorithm in which the agents collaboratively
   generate an abstract and approximate global coordination plan and then
   individually extend the global plan to executable plans. To guide GPPP,
   we propose two domain independent privacy preserving heuristics based on
   landmarks and pattern databases, which are classical heuristics for
   single agent search. These heuristics, called privacy-preserving
   landmarks and privacy preserving PDBs, are agnostic to the planning
   algorithm and can be used by other privacy-preserving planning
   algorithms. Empirically, we demonstrate on benchmark domains the
   benefits of using these heuristics and the advantage of GPPP over
   existing privacy preserving planners for the multi-agent STRIPS
   formalism.}},

Abstract = {{AT A TIME when increasingly potent technologies are being developed with
   the potential to transform society, researchers in all technological
   fields, including information and communications technology (ICT), are
   under growing pressure to consider and reflect on the motivations,
   purposes, and possible consequences associated with their research. This
   pressure comes from the general public, civil society, and government
   institutions. In parallel is a growing recognition that current ethics
   review procedures within ICT may not address broader concerns (such as
   the potential societal consequences of innovation).
   Instances of ICT raising concerns abound. For example, along with
   attention-grabbing headlines that artificial intelligence (AI) could
   ultimately pose an existential threat to humankind, there are more
   prosaic, yet strongly felt, social transformations}},

Abstract = {{In multi-sensor data fusion based on multiple features, the high
   dimensionality of feature space increases the runtime and computational
   complexity. The present study proposes a new algorithm based on the
   combination of random subspace (RS), linear discriminant analysis and
   sparse regularisation (LDASR), namely RS-LDASR for feature space
   dimensionality reduction, supervised feature selection, and learning.
   The use of RSs can effectively solve the problem of high dimensionality
   and high feature-to-instance ratio. The extraction of multiple features
   from the images raises the possibility of a correlation between features
   which reduce classification accuracy. In this study, after the
   construction of several RSs, supervised feature selection and learning
   based on LDASR were applied with very high accuracy. Classification and
   image fusion for remote sensing data analysis were tested by the
   implementation of feature-based fusion on two pairs of fused synthetic
   aperture radar and optical data. Four feature matrices were constructed
   using attribute profiles (APs), multi-APs (MAPs), non-negative matrix
   factorisation (NMF), and textural features. Support vector machine and
   rotation forest were applied as the base classifiers. The results show
   that use of RS-LDASR significantly improved the classification accuracy
   based on NMF plus texture features and even NMF alone.}},

Abstract = {{Dictionary learning (DL) technique has received a great interest
   recently, due to its significant role in feature extraction. Although
   many DL-based methods have been presented, some of them still suffer
   from the lack of discriminative features, especially for the local
   manifold features. To mitigate this problem, the authors propose a novel
   DL method named low-rank representation based on twin tensor kernel
   (LRR-TTK) DL for face recognition in this study. Specifically, the
   training samples are projected to a high-dimensional space with TTK.
   Then, they extract the local manifold features and spatial features
   (representation coefficients) hidden in the facial images by TT locality
   preserving projection. In addition, powered by LRR reconstruction and DL
   theory, much more discriminative features are obtained, which can
   improve the recognition rate greatly. Comprehensive experimental results
   at AR, extended Yale-B and FERET face databases demonstrate the
   superiority of their proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate gathering of phenotypic information is a key aspect in several
   subject matters, including biometrics, biomedical analysis, forensics,
   and many other. Automatic identification of anatomical structures of
   biometric interest, such as fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial
   traits, are extensively used in applications like access control and
   anthropological research, all having in common the drawback of requiring
   intrusive means for acquiring the required information. In this regard,
   the ear structure has multiple advantages. Not only the ear's biometric
   markers can be easily captured from the distance with non intrusive
   methods, but also they experiment almost no changes over time, and are
   not influenced by facial expressions. Here we present a new method based
   on Geometric Morphometrics and Deep Learning for automatic ear detection
   and feature extraction in the form of landmarks. A convolutional neural
   network was trained with a set of manually landmarked examples. The
   network is able to provide morphometric landmarks on ears' images
   automatically, with a performance that matches human landmarking. The
   feasibility of using ear landmarks as feature vectors opens a novel
   spectrum of biometrics applications.}},

Abstract = {{The following work addresses the problem of scheduling operations on a
   flow network, as well as alignment (path) allocation. This is a
   multi-objective problem, and this paper proposes a solution method
   through a hybrid approach based on a genetic algorithm in conjunction
   with (max, +) algebra. A concise system abstraction is proposed through
   a non-linear (max, +) model. This model describes the main optimization
   constraints which dictate the behavior of the mutation and crossover
   operations in the genetic algorithm. Additionally, each individual in
   the population represents the value assignment of the decision
   variables, which linearizes the (max, +) model. A hierarchic genetic
   structure is proposed for individuals such that variable dependence is
   modeled. For each individual, the (max, +)-linear model is solved
   through a matrix product which determines the daters for alignment
   enabling for transfer operations. The study is extendable to complex
   net-structured systems of different nature. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

   selection of the best base classifier used in ensembles on credit data
   sets. It is shown that a very simple base classifier, based on imprecise
   probabilities and uncertainty measures, attains a better trade-off among
   some aspects of interest for this type of studies such as accuracy and
   area under ROC curve (AUC). The AUC measure can be considered as a more
   appropriate measure in this grounds, where the different type of errors
   have different costs or consequences. The results shown here present to
   this simple classifier as an interesting choice to be used as base
   classifier in ensembles for credit scoring and bankruptcy prediction,
   proving that not only the individual performance of a classifier is the
   key point to be selected for an ensemble scheme. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Recently, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (Al) have been widely
   used to improve positioning accuracy for land vehicle navigation by
   integrating the Global Positioning System (GPS) with the Strapdown
   Inertial Navigation System (SINS). In this paper, we propose the
   ensemble learning algorithm instead of traditional single neural network
   to overcome the limitations of complex and dynamic data cased by vehicle
   irregular movement. The ensemble learning algorithm (LSBoost or
   Bagging), similar to the neural network, can build the SINS/GPS position
   model based on current and some past samples of SINS velocity, attitude
   and IMU output information. The performance of the proposed algorithm
   has been experimentally verified using GPS and SINS data of different
   trajectories collected in some land vehicle navigation tests. The
   comparison results between the proposed model and traditional algorithms
   indicate that the proposed algorithm can improve the positioning
   accuracy for cases of SINS and specific GPS outages. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, a local linear radial basis function (LLRBF) neural
   network that uses a skewed Gaussian activation function, called
   LLRBF-SG, is applied to the problem of ore grade estimation of highly
   skewed data from the Esfordi phosphate deposit. The network is trained
   using SPABC-BP, a method that combines a novel simultaneous perturbation
   artificial bee colony algorithm (SPABC) and badk-propagation (BP)
   Method. The SPABC algorithm is an extension of the standard artificial
   bee colony (ABC) algorithm that includes a tournament selection
   strategy, simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation method and
   new search equations. The predictive accuracy of the network trained
   with the SPABC-BP algorithm is compared with hybrid versions of
   evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms, such as standard
   artificial bee colony, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy
   (CMAES) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) with BP. From the
   experimental results one concludes that networks trained with the
   SPABC-BP algorithm outperform networks trained with the alternative
   algorithms in the process of ore grade estimation. The predictive
   accuracy of the LLRBF-SG-SPABC-BP is compared with LLRBF-SPABC-BP and
   standard radial basis function (RBF) trained with SPABC-BP algorithm. An
   analysis of the results shows that the proposed LLRBF-SG network has
   higher generalization ability and is better suited to the problem of
   predicting ore grade values for highly skewed data.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is essential
   to agricultural water management. The present study developed two
   artificial intelligence models for daily ET0 estimation only with
   temperature data, including extreme learning machine (ELM) and
   generalized regression neural network (GRNN) in 6 meteorological
   stations of Sichuan basin, southwest China, and compared the proposed
   ELM and GRNN with the corresponding temperature-based Hargreaves (HG)
   model and its calibrated version considering FAO-56 Penman-Monteith ET0
   as benchmark. Two data management scenarios were evaluated for
   estimation of ET0: (1) the models were trained/calibrated and tested
   using the local data of each station; and (2) the models were
   trained/calibrated using the pooled data from all the stations and
   tested in each station. In the first scenario, the results showed that
   the temperature-based ELM model provided the better estimation than the
   GRNN, HG and calibrated HG models, with average relative root mean
   square error (RRMSE) of 0.198, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.267 mmid
   and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) of 0.891, respectively. In the
   second scenario, GRNN model provided the most accurate results among the
   considered models, with average RRMSE of 0.194, MAE of 0.263 mm/d and NS
   of 0.895, respectively. Both of the temperature-based GRNN and ELM
   performed much better than the HG and calibrated HG models for the two
   scenarios, and the temperature-based GRNN and ELM models are appropriate
   alternatives for accurate estimation of ET0 for Sichuan basin of
   southwest China, which is very helpful for farmers or irrigation system
   operators to improve their irrigation scheduling. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{In the business process of reengineering, one of the main problems
   consists in the organizational reintegration of the employee. New
   instruments for the automatic identification of stakeholders among
   existing staff evaluation are needed. It is difficult to identify a
   stakeholder, especially if we refer to science stakeholders, and the
   proper evaluation of a researcher's value and position at international
   level is needed. There are large contradictions concerning the validity
   of various types of indexing services and other techniques used to
   classify the researchers. This paper proposes the use of corporate Human
   Resource Management (HRM) specific instruments when it comes to the
   researcher as informational stakeholder identification. The main idea
   behind the method is to use some form of information retrieval
   techniques over a set of research papers which contain, mostly, the same
   key words and to extract the hierarchy of the researchers
   involved/referenced over that set. A distributed approach was used due
   to its inherent scalability. The use of an inference engine was also
   deemed necessary due to the complexity of the problem. The system may be
   used in the automatic assessment of research performance in public or
   private institutions. It can be easily modified to support complex sets
   of rules depending on each user's needs in personnel evaluation. The
   main research field of this papers concerns distributed artificial
   intelligence. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{293-305}},

Abstract = {{The preprocessing stage in knowledge discovery projects is costly,
   normally taking between 50\% and 80\% of the total project time. It is
   in this stage that data in a relational database are transformed for
   applying a data mining technique. This stage is a complex task that
   demands from database designers a strong interaction with experts having
   a broad knowledge about the application domain. Frameworks aiming to
   systemize this stage have significant limitations when applied to Credit
   Behavioral Scoring solutions. This paper proposes a framework based on
   the Model Driven Development approach to systemize the mentioned stage.
   This work has three main contributions: 1) improving the discriminant
   power of data mining techniques by means of the construction of new
   input variables which embed temporal knowledge for the technique; 2)
   reducing the time of data transformation using automatic code
   generation, and 3) allowing artificial intelligence and statistics
   modelers to perform the data transformation without the help of database
   experts. In order to validate the proposed framework, two comparative
   studies were conducted. Experiments showed that the proposed framework
   delivers a performance equivalent or superior to those of existing
   frameworks and reduces the time of data transformation with a confidence
   level of 95\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Neurocomputational Model of Goal-Directed Navigation in
   Insect-Inspired Artificial Agents}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{APR 12}},
Abstract = {{Despite their small size, insect brains are able to produce robust and
   efficient navigation in complex environments. Specifically in social
   insects, such as ants and bees, these navigational capabilities are
   guided by orientation directing vectors generated by a process called
   path integration. During this process, they integrate compass and
   odometric cues to estimate their current location as a vector, called
   the home vector for guiding them back home on a straight path. They
   further acquire and retrieve path integration-based vector memories
   globally to the nest or based on visual landmarks. Although existing
   computational models reproduced similar behaviors, a neurocomputational
   model of vector navigation including the acquisition of vector
   representations has not been described before. Here we present a model
   of neural mechanisms in a modular closed-loop control enabling vector
   navigation in artificial agents. The model consists of a path
   integration mechanism, reward-modulated global learning, random search,
   and action selection. The path integration mechanism integrates compass
   and odometric cues to compute a vectorial representation of the agent's
   current location as neural activity patterns in circular arrays. A
   reward-modulated learning rule enables the acquisition of vector
   memories by associating the local food reward with the path integration
   state. A motor output is computed based on the combination of vector
   memories and random exploration. In simulation, we show that the neural
   mechanisms enable robust homing and localization, even in the presence
   of external sensory noise. The proposed learning rules lead to
   goal-directed navigation and route formation performed under realistic
   conditions. Consequently, we provide a novel approach for vector
   learning and navigation in a simulated, situated agent linking
   behavioral observations to their possible underlying neural substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Planning safe trajectories in keyhole neurosurgery requires a high level
   of accuracy in order to reach small anatomical structures in operations
   such as biopsies, deep brain stimulation and other therapy/diagnostic

   neurosurgeon to select the entry point of the procedure using an atlas
   which displays the risk of the different linear trajectories from the
   head surface skin to the target. The risk assignment is carried out in
   two main steps, a weighted sum which depends on the distance of a single
   voxel to other risk structures and a second criteria using fuzzy rules
   to take into account other qualities such as length, which is the main
   contribution of this work. As a result, we present risk maps of two
   targets and visualize the less risky trajectories according to the
   system.}},

   present the three steps toward the parallel management of plant: growth
   description (the crop model), prediction, and prescription. This

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{58-70}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Today, there is considerable interest in personal healthcare. The
   pervasiveness of technology allows to precisely track human behavior;
   however, when dealing with the development of an intelligent assistant
   exploiting data acquired through such technologies, a critical issue has
   to be taken into account; namely, that of supporting the user in the
   event of any transgression with respect to the optimal behavior. In this
   paper we present a reasoning framework based on Simple Temporal Problems
   that can be applied to a general class of problems, which we called
   cake\&carrot problems, to support reasoning in presence of human
   transgression. The reasoning framework offers a number of facilities to
   ensure a smart management of possible ``wrong behaviors{''} by a user to
   reach the goals defined by the problem.
   This paper describes the framework by means of the prototypical use case
   of diet domain. Indeed, following a healthy diet can be a difficult task
   for both practical and psychological reasons and dietary transgressions
   are hard to avoid. Therefore, the framework is tolerant to dietary
   transgressions and adapts the following meals to facilitate users in
   recovering from such transgressions. Finally, through a simulation
   involving a real hospital menu, we show that the framework can
   effectively achieve good results in a realistic scenario. (C) 2017

Volume = {{68}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{CREDO is a framework for understanding human expertise and for designing
   and deploying systems that support cognitive tasks like situation and
   risk assessment, decision-making, therapy planning and workflow
   management. The framework has evolved through an extensive program of
   research on human decision-making and clinical practice. It draws on
   concepts from cognitive science, and has contributed new results to
   cognitive theory and understanding of human expertise and
   knowledge-based AI. These results are exploited in a suite of
   technologies for designing, implementing and deploying clinical
   services, early versions of which were reported by Das et al. (1997)
   {[}9] and Fox and Das (2000) {[}26]. A practical outcome of the CREDO
   program is a technology stack, a key element of which is an agent
   specification language (PROforma: Sutton and Fox (2003) {[}55]) which
   has proved to be a versatile tool for designing point of care
   applications in many clinical specialties and settings. Since software
   became available for implementing and deploying PROforma applications
   many kinds of services have been successfully built and trialed, some of
   which are in large-scale routine use. This retrospective describes the
   foundations of the CREDO model, summarizes the main theoretical,
   technical and clinical contributions, and discusses benefits of the

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{43}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Digital manufacturing systems are determined to be a major key to
   enhance productivity and quality mainly due to real-time process
   monitoring and control capability with instant data processing. During
   machining, such systems are anticipated to excerpt reliable data within
   a short time-lapse, monitor tool wear progress, anticipate its wear and
   breakage, alert the machinist in real time to avoid unexpected failure
   of tool or machine, and help obtaining quality products. This is vital,
   especially, when drilling Ni-/Ti-based superalloys because catastrophic
   failure and premature breakage of tools occur in random manner due to
   aggressive welding and chipping of tool including the rake and/or flank
   faces and tool corner.
   Nowadays, spindle power data are easy to collect directly from modern
   machine tools and can be made available in production floor for such
   real-time data processing. This work aims to evaluate spindle power data
   for real-time tool wear/breakage prediction during drilling of a
   Ni-based superalloy, Inconel 625. Experiments were performed by varying
   speed and feed. Spindle power data were collected from the power meter
   (also called load meter) to feed into the neural network (NN) for
   functional processing. To understand the reliability of the spindle
   power data, force data were also collected and compared. The results
   show that the trends of these two different types of data over cutting
   time are similar for any feed and speed combinations. The error in NN
   prediction from actual wear was found to be between 0.8-18.4\% with
   power data as compared to that between 0.4-17.9\% with force data.
   Findings suggest that spindle power data integrated with the artificial
   intelligence (NN) system can be used for real-time tool wear/breakage
   monitoring and process control, thus appreciate digital manufacturing
   systems. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Society of

Abstract = {{Question generation is an emerging research area of artificial
   intelligence in education. Question authoring tools are important in
   educational technologies, e.g., intelligent tutoring systems, as well as
   in dialogue systems. Approaches to generate factual questions, i.e.,
   questions that have concrete answers, mainly make use of the syntactical
   and semantic information in a declarative sentence, which is then
   transformed into questions. Recently, some research has been conducted
   to investigate Chinese factual question generation with some limited
   success. Reported performance is poor due to unavoidable errors (e.g.,
   sentence parsing, name entity recognition, and rule-based question
   transformation errors) and the complexity of long Chinese sentences.
   This article introduces a novel Chinese question generation systembased
   on three stages, sentence simplification, question generation and
   ranking, to address the challenge of automatically generating factual
   questions in Chinese. The proposed approach and systemhave been
   evaluated on sentences from the New Practical Chinese Reader corpus.
   Experimental results show that ranking improves more than 20 percentage
   of questions rated as acceptable by annotators, from 65 percent of all
   questions to 87 percent of the top ranked 25 percent questions.}},

   industrial factory}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares different methods for solving a location-routing
   problem (LRP), using real-world data from the bus transport service for
   employees of a large-scale industrial factory in Thailand. We tested
   four AI (artificial intelligence) techniques Maximin, K-means, Fuzzy
   C-means, and Competitive Learning and two hybrids of these four K-means
   with Competitive Learning and K-means with Maximin to allocate the bus
   stops. The efficiency of the algorithms was compared, in terms of the
   quality of the solutions. The K-means with Maximin provided the best
   solution, as it minimized number of bus stop locations and employees'
   total traveling distance while satisfied employee at maximum radius 1.73
   km, compared to K-means with Competitive Learning, as the same number of
   bus stop it provided higher total traveling distance and maximum radius.
   The other non-hybrid techniques provided higher number of bus stop
   locations.
   We then used ant colony optimization (ACO) to determine the optimal
   routing between the 300-700 bus stops as allocated by K-means with
   Maximin. The optimal bus routing to transport the factory's 5000 plus
   employees required 134 buses (134 independent routes) covering 500 bus
   stops and traveling nearly 5000 km. While optimal, this routing was
   costly and created monitoring difficulties. To address these concerns,
   we constrained the number of bus routes; while this dramatically
   increased the total distance, it provided a more practical solution for
   the factory. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the major challenges that reside on target coverage
   problem, which is one among the two primary sub-problems of node

   Moreover, the VABC component of V-VABC is a hybrid, heuristic search
   algorithm developed from the context of ABC and particle swarm
   optimization (PSO). The V-VABC is an attempt to solve the network, which
   has an equal number of both sensors and targets, which is a special case

Abstract = {{Natural Language Processing is the multidisciplinary area of Artificial
   Intelligence, Machine Learning and Computational Linguistic for
   processing human language automatically. It involves understanding and
   processing of human language. The way through which we share our
   contents or feelings have always great importance in understanding and
   processing of language. Parsing is the most suited approach in
   identifying and scanning what the available sentences expressed? Parsing
   is the process in which syntactic structure of sentence is identified
   using grammatical tags. The syntactically correct sentence structure is
   achieved by assigning grammatical labels to its constituents using
   lexicon and syntactic rules. Phrase and Dependency are two main
   structure formalisms for parsing natural language sentences. The growing
   use of web 2.0 has produced novel research challenges as people from
   different geographical areas are using this channel and sharing contents
   in their native languages. Urdu is one of such free word order native
   language which is widely shared over social media sites but
   identification and summarization of Urdu sentences is challenging task.
   In this review paper we present an overview to recent work in parsing of
   fixed order (i.e. English) and free word order languages (i.e Urdu) in
   order to reveal the most suited method for Urdu Language Parsing. This
   survey explored that dependency parsing is more appropriate for Urdu and
   other free word order languages and parsers of English language are not
   useful in parsing Urdu sentence due to its morphological, syntactical
   and grammatical differences.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Protein structure alignment and comparisons that are based on an
   alphabetical demonstration of protein structure are more simple to run
   with faster evaluation processes; thus, their accuracy is not as
   reliable as three-dimension (3D)-based tools. As a 1D method candidate,
   TS-AMIR used the alphabetic demonstration of secondary-structure
   elements (SSE) of proteins and compared the assigned letters to each SSE
   using the n-gram method. Although the results were comparable to those
   obtained via geometrical methods, the SSE length and accuracy of
   adjacency between SSEs were not considered in the comparison process.
   Therefore, to obtain further information on accuracy of adjacency
   between SSE vectors, the new approach of assigning text to vectors was
   adopted according to the spherical coordinate system in the present
   study. Moreover, dynamic programming was applied in order to account for
   the length of SSE vectors. Five common datasets were selected for method
   evaluation. The first three datasets were small, but difficult to align,
   and the remaining two datasets were used to compare the capability of
   the proposed method with that of other methods on a large protein
   dataset. The results showed that the proposed method, as a text-based
   alignment approach, obtained results comparable to both 1D and 3D
   methods. It outperformed 1D methods in terms of accuracy and 3D methods
   in terms of runtime.}},

Abstract = {{Next-generation wireless networks are expected to support extremely high
   data rates and radically new applications, which require a new wireless
   radio technology paradigm. The challenge is that of assisting the radio
   in intelligent adaptive learning and decision making, so that the
   diverse requirements of next-generation wireless networks can be
   satisfied. Machine learning is one of the most promising artificial
   intelligence tools, conceived to support smart radio terminals. Future
   smart 5G mobile terminals are expected to autonomously access the most
   meritorious spectral bands with the aid of sophisticated spectral
   efficiency learning and inference, in order to control the transmission
   power, while relying on energy efficiency learning/inference and
   simultaneously adjusting the transmission protocols with the aid of
   quality of service learning/inference. Hence we briefly review the
   rudimentary concepts of machine learning and propose their employment in
   the compelling applications of 5G networks, including cognitive radios,
   massive MIMOs, femto/small cells, heterogeneous networks, smart grid,
   energy harvesting, device-to-device communications, and so on. Our goal
   is to assist the readers in refining the motivation, problem

   this scheme, the strengths of feed-forward artificial neural networks

   Two types of mathematical models of the systems are constructed with the
   help of ANNs by defining an unsupervised error with and without exactly
   satisfying the initial conditions. The design parameters of ANN models
   are optimized with a hybrid approach GA-IPT, where GA is used as a tool
   for effective global search, and IPT is incorporated for rapid local
   convergence. The proposed scheme is tested on three different types of
   IVPs of P-FDE with orders 1-3. The correctness of the scheme is
   established by comparison with the existing exact solutions. The
   accuracy and convergence of the proposed scheme are further validated
   through a large number of numerical experiments by taking different

   present article, leads to more accurate results with fewer function
   evaluations. Also, multi-objectivity of the problem is handled by
   transforming it into a single-objective problem by using the weighted
   sum method. The efficiency of the proposed ACS-QA algorithm is tested in
   comparison to the algorithms existing in literature by implementing it
   on six different benchmark optimization problems. Afterward, the
   proposed ACS-QA algorithm and the ACS algorithm are implemented on
   multi-objective EELD problems with different generation units. The
   results are compared with the solutions in literature utilizing
   different metaheuristic optimization algorithms. Both studies firmly
   showed that the ACS-QA algorithm is able to find more accurate results
   even though it uses fewer function evaluation calls.}},

Abstract = {{The swarm cognitive behavior of bees readily translates to swarm
   intelligence with ``social cognition,{''} thus giving rise to the rapid
   promotion of survival skills and resource allocation. This paper
   presents a novel cognitively inspired artificial bee colony clustering
   (ABCC) algorithm with a clustering evaluation model to manage the energy
   consumption in cognitive wireless sensor networks (CWSNs). The ABCC
   algorithm can optimally align with the dynamics of the sensor nodes and
   cluster heads in CWSNs. These sensor nodes and cluster heads adapt to
   topological changes in the network graph over time. One of the major
   challenges with employing CWSNs is to maximize the lifetime of the
   networks. The ABCC algorithm is able to reduce and balance the energy
   consumption of nodes across the networks. Artificial bee colony (ABC)
   optimization is attractive for this application as the cognitive
   behaviors of artificial bees match perfectly with the intrinsic dynamics
   in cognitive wireless sensor networks. Additionally, it employs fewer
   control parameters compared to other heuristic algorithms, making
   identification of optimal parameter settings easier. Simulation results
   illustrate that the ABCC algorithm outperforms particle swarm
   optimisation (PSO), group search optimization (GSO), low-energy adaptive
   clustering hierarchy (LEACH), LEACH-centralized (LEACH-C), and hybrid
   energy-efficient distributed clustering (HEED) for energy management in
   CWSNs. Our proposed algorithm is increasingly superior to these other
   approaches as the number of nodes in the network grows.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge graph representation has been a long standing goal of
   artificial intelligence. In this paper, we consider a method for
   knowledge graph embedding of hyper-relational data, which are commonly
   found in knowledge graphs. Previous models such as Trans (E, H, R) and
   CTransR are either insufficient for embedding hyper-relational data or
   focus on projecting an entity into multiple embeddings, which might not
   be effective for generalization nor accurately reflect real knowledge.
   To overcome these issues, we propose the novel model TransHR, which
   transforms the hyper-relations in a pair of entities into an individual
   vector, serving as a translation between them. We experimentally
   evaluate our model on two typical tasks-link prediction and triple
   classification. The results demonstrate that TransHR significantly
   outperforms Trans (E, H, R) and CTransR, especially for hyperrelational
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Process planning is a key step for obtaining high machine quality and
   efficiency in the polishing. By studying the polishing process planning
   idea of the skilled technician, a novel process planning method
   combining with artificial intelligence principle is proposed in this
   paper. Polishing planning model based on fuzzy theory and case-based
   reasoning (CBR) technology is investigated in detail, which consists of
   fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of material machinability, case
   retrieval, case inference, and case modification. Fuzzy comprehensive
   evaluation standard based on material physical mechanics performance
   index is used for determining material cutting performance level.
   Specific steps are as follows: establishing the factor set, establishing
   the weight set, establishing evaluation set, fuzzy evaluation of single
   factor, and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. The primary cases are chosen
   according to the grade of material cutting performance. In case
   retrieval, all primary cases are retrieved in terms of the nearest
   neighbor principle and the similarity between two cases is calculated
   according to Euler distance. The retrieval features include the surface
   roughness before polishing, material characteristics, and the surface
   roughness requirements after polishing. In the case inference, the
   method of the cross-correlation coefficient is used for reasoning all
   cases retrieved in order to evaluate the impact of each process
   parameter on the surface quality and identify the relevance of each
   process parameters on the surface quality. In the case modification, the
   methods of linear extrapolation and parameter adjustment are used for
   adjusting and revising the process parameters of case retrieved
   according to the correlation coefficients. At last, example verification
   is finished and the experiment results are generally acceptable. It is
   concluded that it is feasible to solve the problem of polishing process
   parameters selection using this method.}},

Abstract = {{Growth of mobile-based applications and traffic on web has made the role
   of schedulers in communication networks very challenging. The continuous
   pressure asserted by these applications is so large that even versatile
   WiMAX networks are facing stiff challenges in fair distribution of
   resources to these real- and non-real-time applications. Maintenance of
   fairness and flagrant quality of service levels among various
   applications is only possible with adaptive and intelligent scheduling
   mechanism. Design of such system is only possible if artificial
   intelligence is embedded in base station scheduler. This paper proposes
   mechanism for allocation of resources in WiMAX networks utilizing fuzzy
   logic principles. The proposed mechanism guarantees that latency and
   throughput requirements of real- and non-real-time traffic classes are
   met. Variations in incoming traffic have been exploited and used in
   decision making for offering bandwidth to maintain effective performance
   levels for all traffic classes. The proposed scheduler considers
   requests from subscribers and exploits powers of fuzzy logic to extract
   new weights for queues serving various traffic classes in a WiMAX
   network on the basis of most recent values of latency, throughput and
   share of traffic. The scheduling framework has been rigorously tested by
   performing versatile experiments for ensuring quality of service levels
   under hard hitting conditions. Fairness of scheduler has also been
   explored and results obtained are quite promising.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of non-hydrocarbon (Non-HC) gas components in the
   gas-oil separators reduces the cost of gas and oil production in
   petroleum engineering. However, this task is difficult because there is
   no known relation among the properties of crude oil and the separators.
   There are studies that attempt to predict hydrocarbons (HCs) components
   using either Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques or conventional
   techniques like Equitation-of-State (EOS) and Empirical Correlation
   (EC). In this paper, we explore the applicability of CI techniques such
   as Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Regressions, and Adaptive
   Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System to predict the Non-HC gas components in
   gas-oil separator tank. Further, we incorporate Genetic Algorithms (GA)
   into the Hybrid Computational Intelligence (HCI) models to enhance the
   accuracy of prediction. GA is used to determine the most favorable
   values of the tuning parameters in the CI models. The performances of
   the CI and HCI models are compared with the performance of the
   conventional techniques like EOS and EC. The experimental results show
   that accuracy of prediction by CI and HCI models outperform the
   conventional methods for N-2 and H2S gas components. Furthermore, the
   HCI models perform better than the non-optimized CI models while
   predicting the Non-HC gas components.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for artificial intelligences and robotics in achieving the
   capacity of consciousness, sentience and rationality offers the prospect
   that these agents have minds. If so, then there may be a potential for
   these minds to become dysfunctional, or for artificial intelligences and
   robots to suffer from mental illness. The existence of artificially
   intelligent psychopathology can be interpreted through the philosophical
   perspectives of mental illness. This offers new insights into what it
   means to have either robot or human mental disorders, but may also offer
   a platform on which to examine the mechanisms of biological or
   artificially intelligent psychiatric disease. The possibility of mental
   illnesses occurring in artificially intelligent individuals necessitates
   the consideration that at some level, they may have achieved a mental
   capability of consciousness, sentience and rationality such that they
   can subsequently become dysfunctional. The deeper philosophical
   understanding of these conditions in mankind and artificial
   intelligences might therefore offer reciprocal insights into mental
   health and mechanisms that may lead to the prevention of mental
   dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Between 2011 and 2013, convenience store retail business grew
   dramatically in Thailand. As a result, most companies have increasingly
   been choosing the application of performance measurement systems. This
   significantly results in poor performance measurement regarding future
   business lagging measure. To solve this problem, this research presents
   a hybrid predictive performance measurement system (PPMS) using the
   neuro-fuzzy approach based on particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO).
   It is constructed from many leading aspects of convenience store
   performance measures and projects the competitive level of future
   business lagging measure. To do so, monthly store performance measures
   were first congregated from the case study value chains. Second, data
   cleaning and preparations by headquarter accounting verification were
   carried out before the proposed model construction. Third, these results
   were used as the learning dataset to derive a predictive performance
   measurement system based on ANFIS-PSO. The fuzzy value of each leading
   input was optimized by parallel processing PSO, before feeding to the
   neuro-fuzzy system. Finally, the model provides a future performance for
   the next month's sales and expense to managers who focused on managing a
   store using desirability function (. It boosted the sales growth in 2012
   by ten percentages using single PPMS. Additionally, the composite PPMS
   was also boosted by the same growth rate for the store in the blind test
   (July 2013-February 2014). From the experimental results, it can be
   concluded that ANFIS-PSO delivers high-accuracy modeling, delivering
   much smaller error and computational time compared to artificial neural
   network model and supports vector regression but its component searching
   time differs significantly because of the complexity of each model.}},

Abstract = {{To accomplish reliable and efficient information routing, strong paths
   connecting all nodes are required in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs).
   Classical algorithms in graphic theory could find only one minimum
   spanning tree (MST) in VANETs. Swarm intelligence paradigms are able to
   obtain several alternatives to MST, which is useful for improving
   reliability of VANETs. This paper proposes a binary coded artificial bee
   colony (BABC) algorithm for tackling the spanning tree construction
   problem. A two-element variation technique is designed to keep the
   consistence of binary coded solutions. The proposed algorithm is applied
   to tackle a roadside-to-vehicle communication example. The success rate
   and average hitting time of the algorithm to find MST are also analyzed.
   It is found that the BABC algorithm could find MST with 92\%
   probability. Though it is slower than Kruskal algorithm in terms of
   computational time, the BABC algorithm can attain several suboptimal
   spanning trees in one run. This suggests that the algorithm would be
   useful under the condition that tree paths are required to be rebuilt
   frequently while the network topology is unchanged in a short period.

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have drawn great attention in
   wireless communications. Prompt and reliable vehicular communication is
   a must to provide a good service. Routing is the key problem in
   information transmission of VANETs. This paper studies quality of
   service (QoS) constrained multicast routing problem. This problem has
   been proved to be NP-complete problem, and swarm intelligence algorithms
   are more suitable than classical algorithms. A micro artificial bee
   colony (MABC) algorithm is proposed to deal with the problem. The QoS
   constraints include maximize network lifetime and minimizing delay cost.
   Multicast routing is abstracted to a continuous optimization problem.
   Then, it is linked with MABC. Numerical simulation is implemented on a
   traffic scenario with three instances. Results show that the MABC
   algorithm successfully attains the optimal routes. Moreover, the routing
   framework can be applied in real time given the network structure does
   not change too frequently. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Ground vibration is one of the most undesirable effects of blasting
   operation in surface mines. Therefore, it seems that the prediction of
   ground vibrations with a high degree of accuracy is necessary to reduce
   environmental effects. This article proposes a novel swarm intelligence
   algorithm based on cuckoo search (NSICS) to create a precise equation
   for predicting the ground vibration produced by blasting operations in
   Miduk copper mine, Iran. To evaluate the proposed NSICS model, several
   empirical equations were also utilized. In this regard, 85 blasting
   events were considered, and the values of two effective parameters on
   the ground vibration, namely, maximum charge used per delay and distance
   between blast face and monitoring station, were measured. In addition,
   the values of peck particle velocity (PPV), as a vibration descriptor,
   were recorded in each blasting. Two performance indices, i.e., root mean
   square error and coefficient of multiple correlation (R-2), were used to
   determine the performance capacity of the proposed models. Comparing the
   values predicted by the models demonstrated that the proposed equation
   by NSICS is more reliable than empirical equations in predicting the
   PPV.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, discriminative correlation filter based trackers have achieved
   extremely successful results in many competitions and benchmarks. These
   methods utilise a periodic assumption of the training samples to
   efficiently learn a classifier. However, this assumption will produce
   unwanted boundary effects which severely degrade the tracking
   performance. Correlation filters with limited boundaries and spatially
   regularised discriminative correlation filters were proposed to reduce
   boundary effects. However, their methods use the fixed scale mask or
   pre-designed weights function, respectively, which are unsuitable for
   large-scale variation. In this study, the authors proposed multiscale
   spatially regularised correlation filters (MSRCF) for visual tracking.
   The authors' augmented objective can reduce the boundary effect even in
   large-scale variation, leading to more discriminative model. The
   proposed multiscale regularisation matrix makes MSRCF fast convergence.
   The authors' online tracking algorithm performs favourably against
   state-of-the-art trackers on OTB-2013 and OTB-2015 Benchmark in terms of
   efficiency, accuracy and robustness.}},

Abstract = {{Tracking groups of people is a challenging problem. Groups may grow or
   shrink dynamically with merging and splitting of individuals and
   conventional trackers are not designed to handle such cases. In this
   study, the authors present a conjoint individual and group tracking
   (CIGT) framework based on particle filter and online learning. CIGT has
   four complementary phases: two-phase association, false positive
   elimination, tracking and learning. First, reliable tracklets are
   created and detection responses are associated to tracklets in two-phase
   association. Then, hierarchal false positive elimination is performed
   for unassociated detection responses. In the tracking phase, CIGT
   calculates multiple weights from the observation and jointly models
   individuals and groups. Particle advection is used in the motion model
   of CIGT to facilitate tracking of dense groups. In the learning phase,
   the discriminative appearance model, consisting of shape, colour and
   texture features, is extracted and used in AdaBoost online learning.
   Using the discriminative learning model, state estimation is performed
   on both individuals and groups. The experimental results show that the
   performance of the proposed framework compares favourably with other
   individual and group-tracking methods for both real and synthetic
   datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Energy efficient clustering is a well accepted NP-hard optimization
   problem in Wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Diverse paradigm of
   Computational intelligence (CI) including Evolutionary algorithms (EAs),
   Reinforcement learning (RL), Artificial immune systems (AIS), and more
   recently, Artificial bee colony (ABC) metaheuristic have been used for
   energy efficient clustering in WSNs. Due to ease of use and adaptive
   nature, ABC arose much interest over other population-based
   metaheuristics for solving optimization problems in WSNs. However, its
   search equation, which is comparably poor at exploitation and require
   storage of certain control parameters, contributes to its insufficiency.
   Thus, we present an improved Artificial bee colony (iABC) metaheuristic
   with an improved solution search equation to improve its exploitation
   capabilities. Additionally, in order to increase the global convergence
   of the proposed metaheuristic, an improved population sampling technique
   is introduced through Student's - t distribution, which require only one
   control parameter to compute and store, hence increase efficiency of
   proposed metaheuristic. The proposed metaheuristic maintain a good
   balance between exploration and exploitation search abilities with least
   memory requirements, moreover the use of first of its kind compact
   Student's t distribution, make it suitable for limited hardware
   requirements of WSNs. Further, an energy efficient clustering protocol
   based on iABC metaheuristic is introduced, which inherit the
   capabilities of the proposed metaheuristic to obtain optimal cluster
   heads (CHs) and improve energy efficiency in WSNs. Simulation results
   shows that the proposed clustering protocol outperforms other well known
   protocols on the basis of packet delivery, throughput, energy
   consumption, network lifetime and latency as performance metric.}},

Abstract = {{Ambient intelligence is an emerging platform that provides advances in
   sensors and sensor networks, pervasive computing, and artificial
   intelligence to capture the real time climate data. This result
   continuously generates several exabytes of unstructured sensor data and
   so it is often called big climate data. Nowadays, researchers are trying
   to use big climate data to monitor and predict the climate change and
   possible diseases. Traditional data processing techniques and tools are
   not capable of handling such huge amount of climate data. Hence, there
   is a need to develop advanced big data architecture for processing the
   real time climate data. The purpose of this paper is to propose a big
   data based surveillance system that analyzes spatial climate big data
   and performs continuous monitoring of correlation between climate change
   and Dengue. Proposed disease surveillance system has been implemented
   with the help of Apache Hadoop MapReduce and its supporting tools.}},

   recommendation}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{245}},
Pages = {{38-55}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been
   successfully applied to recommender systems employed in many e-commerce
   companies, such as Amazon, eBay, Netflix, etc., which aim to provide
   personalized recommendations on products or services. Among various
   AI-based recommendation techniques, collaborative filtering has proven
   to be one of the most promising methods. However, most
   collaborative-filtering-based recommender systems, especially the newly
   launched ones, have trouble making accurate recommendations for users.
   This is caused by the data sparsity issue in recommender systems, where
   little existing rating information is available. To address this issue,
   one of the most effective practices is applying transfer learning
   techniques by leveraging relatively rich collaborative data knowledge
   from related systems, which have been well running. Previous transfer
   learning models for recommender systems often assume that a sufficient
   set of entity correspondences (either user or item) across the target
   and auxiliary systems (a.k.a. source systems) is given in advance. This
   assumption does not hold in many real world scenarios where entity
   correspondences across systems are usually unknown, and the cost of
   identifying them can be expensive. In this paper, we propose a new
   transfer learning framework for recommender systems, which relaxes the
   above assumption to facilitate flexible knowledge transfer across
   different systems with low cost by using an active learning principle to
   construct entity correspondences across systems. Specifically, for the
   purpose of maximizing knowledge transfer, we first iteratively select
   entities in the target system based on some criterion to query their
   correspondences in the source system. We then plug the actively
   constructed entity correspondences into a general transferred
   collaborative-filtering model to improve recommendation quality. Based
   on the framework, we propose three solutions by specifying three
   state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods, namely Maximum-Margin
   Matrix Factorization, Regularized Low-rank Matrix Factorization, and
   Probabilistic Matrix Factorization. We perform extensive experiments on
   two real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed
   framework and the three specified solutions for cross-system
   recommendation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a widely studied problem
   with numerous applications in computer science and artificial
   intelligence. For infinite-domain CSPs, there are many results
   separating tractable and NP-hard cases while upper and lower bounds on
   the time complexity of hard cases are virtually unexplored, Hence, we
   initiate a study of the worst-case time complexity of such CSPs, We
   analyze backtracking algorithms and determine upper bounds on their time
   complexity. We present asymptotically faster algorithms based on
   enumeration techniques and we show that these algorithms are applicable
   to well-studied problems in, for instance, temporal reasoning. Finally,
   we prove non-trivial lower bounds applicable to many interesting CSPs,
   under the assumption that certain complexity-theoretic assumptions hold.
   The gap between upper and lower bounds is in many cases surprisingly
   small, which suggests that our upper bounds cannot be significantly

   qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, given the recent surge of

Abstract = {{Swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms, including ant colony optimization,
   particle swarm optimization, bee inspired algorithms, bacterial foraging
   optimization, firefly algorithms, fish swarm optimization and many more,
   have been. proven to be good methods to address difficult optimization
   problems under stationary environments. Most SI algorithms have been
   developed to address stationary optimization problems and hence, they
   can converge on the (near-) optimum solution efficiently. However, many
   real-world problems have a dynamic environment that changes over time.
   For such dynamic optimization problems (DOPs), it is difficult for a
   conventional SI algorithm to track the changing optimum once the
   algorithm has converged on a solution. In the last two decades, there
   has been a growing interest of addressing DOPs using SI algorithms due
   to their adaptation capabilities. This paper presents a broad review on
   Si dynamic optimization (SIDO) focused on several classes of problems,
   such as discrete, continuous, constrained, multi-objective and
   classification problems, and real-world applications. In addition, this
   paper focuses on the enhancement strategies integrated in SI algorithms
   to address dynamic changes, the performance measurements and benchmark
   generators used in SIDO. Finally, some considerations about future
   directions in the subject are given.}},

Abstract = {{Although the use of evolutionary algorithms and fuzzy logic for
   portfolio optimization is an established research area, this field
   remains fascinating because of its important financial aspects. The
   field is brisk and it trances as there always remain research issues
   which are yet to explore. The problem of portfolio optimization
   comprises of finding an optimal distribution of funds among various
   available securities so as to maximize the return and minimize the risk.
   Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is one of the effectual and widely used
   optimization technique based on swarm intelligence. Mixing co-variance
   principles with ABC algorithm assists in quick convergence with more
   precision. This paper presents a novel co-variance guided Artificial Bee
   Colony algorithm for portfolio optimization. As portfolio optimization
   consists of simultaneous optimization of multiple conflicting
   objectives, this algorithm is named as Multi-objective Co-variance based
   ABC (M-CABC). The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is tested on
   benchmark problems of portfolio optimization from the OR-library. The
   results validate the adept performance of the proposed algorithm in
   finding various optimal trade-off solutions simultaneously handling
   realistic constraints. The article concludes with exhaustive post-result
   analysis and observatory remarks to bring out some of the crucial
   properties of optimal portfolios.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses development and application of a decomposition
   neural network rule extraction algorithm for nonlinear regression
   problems. The algorithm is called the piece-wise linear artificial
   neural network or PWL-ANN algorithm. The objective of the algorithm is
   to ``open up{''} the black box of a neural network model so that rules
   in the form of linear equations are generated by approximating the
   sigmoid activation functions of the hidden neurons in an artificial
   neural network (ANN). The preliminary results showed that the algorithm
   gives high fidelity and satisfactory results on sixteen of the nineteen
   tested datasets. By analyzing the values of R2 given by the PWL
   approximation on the hidden neurons and the overall output, it is
   evident that in addition to accurate approximation of each individual
   node of a given ANN model, there are more factors affecting the fidelity
   of the PWL-ANN algorithm Nevertheless, the algorithm shows promising
   potential for domains when better understanding about the problem is
   needed.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by progresses in cognitive science, artificial intelligence,
   computer vision, and mobile computing technologies, we propose and
   implement a wearable virtual usher for cognitive indoor navigation based
   on egocentric visual perception. A novel computational framework of
   cognitive wayfinding in an indoor environment is proposed, which
   contains a context model, a route model, and a process model. A
   hierarchical structure is proposed to represent the cognitive context
   knowledge of indoor scenes. Given a start position and a destination, a
   Bayesian network model is proposed to represent the navigation route
   derived from the context model. A novel dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)
   model is proposed to accommodate the dynamic process of navigation based
   on real-time first-person-view visual input, which involves multiple
   asynchronous temporal dependencies. To adapt to large variations in
   travel time through trip segments, we propose an online adaptation
   algorithm for the DBN model, leading to a self-adaptive DBN. A prototype
   system is built and tested for technical performance and user
   experience. The quantitative evaluation shows that our method achieves
   over 13\% improvement in accuracy as compared to baseline approaches
   based on hidden Markov model. In the user study, our system guides the
   participants to their destinations, emulating a human usher in multiple
   aspects.}},

Abstract = {{Writer identification is an important topic for pattern recognition and
   artificial intelligence. Traditional methods rely heavily on
   sophisticated hand-crafted features to represent the characteristics of
   different writers. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework for
   online text-independent writer identification by using a recurrent
   neural network (RNN). Specifically, the handwriting data of a particular
   writer are represented by a set of random hybrid strokes (RHSs). Each
   RHS is a randomly sampled short sequence representing pen tip movements
   (xy-coordinates) and pen-down or pen-up states. RHS is independent of
   the content and language involved in handwriting; therefore, writer
   identification at the RHS level is more general and convenient than the
   character level or the word level, which also requires character/word
   segmentation. The RNN model with bidirectional long short-term memory is
   used to encode each RHS into a fixed-length vector for final
   classification. All the RHSs of a writer are classified independently,
   and then, the posterior probabilities are averaged to make the final
   decision. The proposed framework is end-to-end and does not require any
   domain knowledge for handwriting data analysis. Experiments on both
   English (133 writers) and Chinese (186 writers) databases verify the
   advantages of our method compared with other state-of-the-art
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding relative statures of channels for disseminating knowledge
   is of practical interest to both generators and consumers of knowledge
   flows. For generators, stature can influence attractiveness of
   alternative dissemination routes and deliberations of those who assess
   generator performance. For knowledge consumers, channel stature may
   influence knowledge content to which they are exposed. This study
   introduces a novel approach to conceptualizing and measuring stature of
   knowledge-dissemination channels: the power-impact (PI) technique. It is
   a flexible technique having 3 complementary variants, giving holistic
   insights about channel stature by accounting for both attraction of
   knowledge generators to a distribution channel and degree to which
   knowledge consumers choose to use a channel's knowledge content. Each PI
   variant is expressed in terms of multiple parameters, permitting
   customization of stature evaluation to suit its user's preferences. In
   the spirit of analytics, each PI variant is driven by objective evidence
   of actual behaviors. The PI technique is based on 2 building blocks: (a)
   power that channels have for attracting results of generators' knowledge
   work, and (b) impact that channel contents' exhibit on prospective
   recipients. Feasibility and functionality of the PI-technique design are
   demonstrated by applying it to solve a problem of journal stature
   evaluation for the information-systems discipline.}},

Title = {{Combining restarts, nogoods and bag-connected decompositions for solving
   CSPs}},
Journal = {{CONSTRAINTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{191-229}},

Abstract = {{From a theoretical viewpoint, the (tree-)decomposition methods offer a
   good approach for solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) when
   their (tree)-width is small. In this case, they have often shown their
   practical interest. So, the literature (coming from Mathematics, OR or
   AI) has concentrated its efforts on the minimization of a single
   parameter, namely the tree-width. Nevertheless, experimental studies
   have shown that this parameter is not always the most relevant to
   consider when solving CSPs. So, in this paper, we highlight two
   fundamental problems related to the use of tree-decomposition and for
   which we offer two particularly appropriate solutions. First, we
   experimentally show that the decomposition algorithms of the state of
   the art produce clusters (a tree-decomposition is a rooted tree of
   clusters) having several connected components. We highlight the fact
   that such clusters create a real disadvantage which affects
   significantly the efficiency of solving methods. To avoid this problem,
   we consider here a new graph decomposition called Bag-Connected
   Tree-Decomposition, which considers only tree-decompositions such that
   each cluster is connected. We analyze such decompositions from an
   algorithmic point of view, especially in order to propose a first
   polynomial time algorithm to compute them. Moreover, even if we consider
   a very well suited decomposition, it is well known that sometimes, a bad
   choice for the root cluster may significantly degrade the performance of
   the solving. We highlight an explanation of this degradation and we
   propose a solution based on restart techniques. Then, we present a new
   version of the BTD algorithm (for Backtracking with Tree-Decomposition
   J,gou and Terrioux, Artificial Intelligence, 146 43-75 28) integrating
   restart techniques. From a theoretical viewpoint, we prove that reduced
   nld-nogoods can be safely recorded during the search and that their size
   is smaller than ones recorded by MAC+RST+NG (Lecoutre et al., JSAT,
   1(3-4) 147-167 34). We also show how structural (no)goods may be
   exploited when the search restarts from a new root cluster. Finally,
   from a practical viewpoint, we show experimentally the benefits of using
   independently bag-connected tree-decompositions and restart techniques
   for solving CSPs by decomposition methods. Above all, we experimentally
   highlight the advantages brought by exploiting jointly these
   improvements in order to respond to two major problems generally
   encountered when solving CSPs by decomposition methods.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, deep learning has attracted an increasing amount of
   attention in machine learning and artificial intelligence areas.
   Currently, many deep learning network-related architectures such as deep
   neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural network (CNN), wavelet
   scattering network (ScatNet) and principal component analysis network
   (PCANet) have been proposed. The most effective network is PCANet, which
   has achieved promising performance in image classification, such as for
   face, object and handwritten digit recognition. PCANet can only handle
   data that are represented by single-view features. In this paper, we
   present a canonical correlation analysis network (CCANet) to address
   image classification, in which images are represented by two-view
   features. The CCANet learns two-view multistage filter banks by a
   canonical correlation analysis (CCA) method and constructs a cascaded
   convolutional deep network. Then, we incorporate filters with
   binaryzation and block-wise histogram processes to form the final depth
   structure. In addition, we introduce a variation of CCANet dubbed
   RandNet-2-in which the filter banks are randomly generated. Extensive
   experiments are conducted using the ETH-80, Yale-B, and USPS databases
   for object classification, face classification and handwritten digits
   classification, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that
   the CCANet algorithm is more effective than PCANet, RandNet-1 and
   RandNet-2. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lexicographic preferences on a set of attributes provide a cognitively
   plausible structure for modeling the behavior of human decision makers.
   Therefore, the induction of corresponding models from revealed
   preferences or observed decisions constitutes an interesting problem
   from a machine learning point of view. In this paper, we introduce a
   learning algorithm for inducing generalized lexicographic preference
   models from a given set of training data, which consists of pairwise
   comparisons between objects. Our approach generalizes simple
   lexicographic orders in the sense of allowing the model to consider
   several attributes simultaneously (instead of looking at them one by
   one), thereby significantly increasing the expressiveness of the model
   class. In order to evaluate our method, we present a case study of a
   highly complex real-world problem, namely the choice of the recognition
   method for actuarial gains and losses from occupational pension schemes.
   Using a unique sample of European companies, this problem is well suited
   for demonstrating the effectiveness of our lexicographic ranker.
   Furthermore, we conduct a series of experiments on benchmark data from
   the machine learning domain. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{138-146}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Using time difference of arrival (TDOA) is one of the two approaches
   that utilize time delay for acoustic source localization. Combining the
   obtained TDOAs together with geometrical relationships within acoustic
   components results in a system of hyperbolic equations. Solving these
   hyperbolic equations is not a trivial procedure especially in the case
   of a large number of microphones. The solution is additionally
   compounded by uncertainties of different backgrounds. The paper
   investigates the performance of neural networks in modelling a
   hyperbolic positioning problem using a feedforward neural network as a
   representative. For experimental purposes, more than 2000 sound files
   were recorded by 8 spatially disposed microphones, for as many
   arbitrarily chosen acoustic source positions. The samples were corrupted
   by high level correlated noise and reverberation. Using
   cross-correlation, with previous signal pre-processing, TDOAs were
   evaluated for every pair of microphones. On the basis of the obtained
   TDOAs and accurate sound source positions, the neural network was
   trained to perform sound source localization. The performance was
   examined using a large number of samples in terms of different acoustic
   sensors setups, network configurations and training parameters. The
   experiment provided useful guidelines for the practical implementation
   of feedforward neural networks in the near-field acoustic localization.
   The procedure does not require substantial knowledge of signal
   processing and that is why it is suitable for a broad range of users.

Title = {{Playing real-time strategy games by imitating human players'
   micromanagement skills based on spatial analysis}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{Unlike the situation with board games, artificial intelligence (AI) for
   real-time strategy (RTS) games usually suffers from numerous possible
   future outcomes because the state of the game is continuously changing
   in real time. Furthermore, Al is also required to be able to handle the
   increased complexity within a small amount of time. This constraint
   makes it difficult to build AI for RTS games with current state-of-the
   art intelligence techniques. A human player, on the other hand, is
   proficient in dealing with this level of complexity, making him a better
   game player than Al bots. Human players are especially good at
   controlling many units at the same time. It is hard to explain the
   micro-level control' skills needed with only a few rules programmed into
   the bots. The design of micromanagement skills is one of the most
   difficult parts in the StarCraft Al design because it must be able to
   handle different combinations of units, army size, and unit placement.
   The unit control skills can have a big effect on the final outcome of a
   full game in professional player matches. For StarCraft Al competitions,
   they employed a relatively simple scripted Al to implement the unit
   control strategy. However, it is difficult to generate cooperative
   behavior using the simple AI strategies. Although there has been a few
   research done on micromanagement skills, it is still a challenging
   problem to design human-like high-level control skills. In this paper,
   we proposed the use of imitation learning based on human replays and
   influence map representation. In this approach, we extracted huge
   numbers of cases from the replays of experts and used them to determine
   the actions of units in the current game case. This was done without
   using any hand coded rules. Because this approach is data-driven, it was
   essential to minimize the case search times. To support fast and
   accurate matching, we chose to use influence maps and data hashing. They
   allowed the imitation system to respond within a small amount time (one
   frame, 0.042 s). With a very large number of cases (up to 500,000
   cases), we showed that it is possible to respond competitively in
   real-time, with a high winning percentage in micromanagement scenarios.

Title = {{A new weighted pathfinding algorithms to reduce the search time on grid
   maps}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{319-331}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are utilized widely in the field
   of Expert Systems (ES) - as applied to robotics, video games
   self-driving vehicles and so on. Pathfinding algorithms are a class of
   heuristic algorithms based on AI techniques which are used in ES as
   decision making functions for the purpose of solving problems that would
   otherwise require human competence or expertise. ES fields that use
   pathfinding algorithms and operate in real-time face many challenges:
   for example time constraints, optimality and memory overhead for storing
   the paths which are found. For these algorithms to work, appropriate
   problem-specific maps must be constructed. In relation to this, the
   uniform-cost grid set-up is the most appropriate for ES applications. In
   this method, each node in a graph is represented as a tile, and the
   weight ``between{''} tiles is set at a constant value, usually this is
   set to 1. In the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms used with this
   data structure, multiplying the heuristic function by a weight greater
   than one is well-known technique. In this paper, we present three new
   techniques using various weights to accelerate heuristic search of grid
   maps. The first such technique is based on the iteration of a heuristic
   search algorithm associated with weight-set w. The second technique is
   based on the length between the start node and goal node, which is then
   associated with w. The last technique is based on the travel cost and is
   associated with a weight-set a. These techniques are applicable to a
   wide class of heuristic search algorithms. Therefore, we implement them,
   here, within the A{*}, the Bidirectional A{*} (Bi-A{*}) and Jump Point
   Search UPS) algorithms; thus obtaining a family of new algorithms.
   Furthermore, it is seen that the use of these new algorithms results in
   significant improvements over current search algorithms. We evaluate
   them in path-planning benchmarks and show the amended JPS technique's
   greater stability, across weight values, over the other two techniques.
   However, it is also shown that this technique yields poor results in
   terms of cost solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding intent and relevance of surrounding agents from video is
   an essential task for many applications in robotics and computer vision.
   The modeling and evaluation of contextual, spatio-temporal situation
   awareness is particularly important in the domain of intelligent
   vehicles, where a robot is required to smoothly navigate in a complex
   environment while also interacting with humans. In this paper, we
   address these issues by studying the task of on-road object importance
   ranking from video. First, human-centric object importance annotations
   are employed in order to analyze the relevance of a variety of
   multi-modal cues for the importance prediction task. A deep
   convolutional neural network model is used for capturing video-based
   contextual spatial and temporal cues of scene type, driving task, and
   object properties related to intent. Second, the proposed importance
   annotations are used for producing novel analysis of error types in
   image-based object detectors. Specifically, we demonstrate how
   cost-sensitive training, informed by the object importance annotations,
   results in improved detection performance on objects of higher
   importance. This insight is essential for an application where
   navigation mistakes are safety-critical, and the quality of automation
   and human robot interaction is key.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing awareness on the reliable distribution of power with
   good quality, the research in power distribution automation surveillance
   system has gained prominence. The performance of distribution system is
   affected significantly by the damaged insulators in numerous ways. With
   enormous growth in the power distribution network, the traditional
   methods of examining the lines by manual patrolling and pole climbing to

   the possible failures before they actually occur. The improvement of a
   proficient, alternative method to assess the condition of insulators in
   a power distribution system using image processing and machine learning

   system to automatically monitor the insulator of overhead power
   distribution lines using extraction of features from wavelet transform
   as well as local binary pattern histogram Fourier (LBP-HF) of the
   insulators and then subsequent condition analysis done by using support

Abstract = {{Game theory, optimal control theory and adaptive dynamic programming
   (ADP) to deal with the optimal tracking control issue for unknown
   non-affine multi-player systems are integrated. It is known that
   non-zero-sum games of non-linear multi-player systems rely on solving a
   set of Hamilton-Jacobi equations, which are generally difficult to be
   computed analytically due to the non-linear nature. Traditional ADP
   methods require the knowledge of accurate system models, and only
   consider the simple affine system version. A novel data-driven
   Q-learning approach, which only needs the measurable data generated by
   running systems, is proposed. To implement this method, neural networks
   (NNs) are utilised, and NN weights are updated through the least-square
   form.}},

Abstract = {{Deep models have recently shown improved performance on numerous
   benchmark tasks in computer vision and machine learning. The
   availability of huge amount of digital data, possibility of massively

   of advance optimisation techniques have pushed the limits of the deep
   learning framework by superseding the performance of state-of-the-art
   research, in specific the kernel methods. This research proposes a novel
   connection between the two paradigms of research and shows empirical
   evidence to emphasise that the knowledge learnt from one domain could be
   supplemented with the significant properties of the other domain to
   achieve the best of both the worlds. The proposed hybrid methodology
   illustrates the advantages of deep architectures for kernel methods by
   showing significant improvement in the classification performance on
   benchmark tasks with kernel methods. It is shown empirically that the
   results achieved are either better or competitive to the leading
   benchmarks from support vector machines and deep models.}},

Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{A novel illumination normalisation (IN) method using a convolutional
   neural network (CNN) is proposed. The proposed network is composed of
   the local pattern extraction (LPE) and illumination elimination (IE)
   layers. The LPE layers model the relationships between the pixels in
   each local region in order to handle various types of local shadow and
   shading in the face image. Based on the commonly used assumption about
   the illumination field, the IE layers generate illumination-insensitive
   ratio images by calculating the ratio between the output pairs produced
   from the LPE layers. The final feature map obtained by combining the
   ratio images can possess an improved discriminative ability for face
   recognition (FR). For training the proposed network, the results
   produced by the Weber fraction-based IN methods as ground truths are
   utilised. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network
   performs better in terms of FR accuracy compared with the conventional
   non-CNN-based method and it can be combined with any CNN-based face

Abstract = {{Wind speed presents a potential seasonal pattern revealed by the
   self-similarity in wavelet periodogram with various scales. The
   corresponding seasonal pattern will promote the improvement of the
   short-term wind speed forecasting accuracy. In this study, a novel
   method for short-term wind speed forecasting using wavelet
   transformation (WT) and AdaBoost technique is proposed to analyse the
   wind speeds distribution features and promote the model configuration.
   Power spectrum and seasonal pattern analysis using the WT are presented
   to investigate the wind speeds feature distribution based on the
   scalogram percentage of energy distribution in different seasons. This
   procedure contributes to perfecting the investigation of wind speed
   seasonal pattern characteristics over time and promotes the sample
   division by computing the statistics measurement based on the estimated
   frequencies interval. The model order estimation based on the
   information criteria is processed to reflect the systems dynamical
   sustainability between the current outputs and historical data. Finally,
   the experiments based on the real data from Yunnan wind farm are given
   to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important challenges in microgrid operation is the
   unintentional islanding occurrence. Unintentional islanding can cause
   serious safety hazards and technical issues. Islanding detection methods
   can be classified into active and passive methods. The main
   disadvantages of the passive methods are large non-detection zone as
   well as determination of suitable threshold value to avoid unwanted
   distributed generations tripping in normal network events. In order to
   overcome these drawbacks, this study proposes a novel, fast, and
   reliable method to identify islanding conditions. The proposed method
   calculates different transient states in the rate of change of frequency
   signal in two consecutive cycles. Various features of the differential
   signal are extracted. The extracted feature vectors associated with
   different operation conditions such as islanding and non-islanding
   events are used to train artificial neural networks (ANNs). The
   performances of different structures of ANNs and also other machine
   learning methods such as support vector machine and adaptive neuro fuzzy
   inference system are evaluated for islanding detection purposes. The
   simulation results indicate that the proposed method provides more
   accurate and faster responses compared with other conventional islanding
   detection methods.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme learning machine (ELM) has attracted considerable attention in
   recent years due to its numerous applications in classification and
   regression. In this study, the authors investigate the performance of an
   ELM-based threshold selection algorithm for 60 GHz millimetre wave time
   of arrival estimation using energy detector (ED). A hybrid metric based
   on the skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation, and slope of the ED
   values is employed. The optimal normalised threshold for different
   signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) is investigated, and the effects of the
   integration period and channel model are examined. Performance results
   are presented which show that the proposed ELM-based algorithm provides
   high precision and better robustness than existing techniques over a
   wide range of SNRs for the IEEE 802.15.3c CM1.1 and CM2.1 channel
   models. Further, the performance is largely independent of the

Abstract = {{Unlike the doublet or triplet constraints, a novel kernelised
   reference-wise metric learning is proposed by constructing
   reference-wise constraints, which contain similarity information of each
   sample to all reference samples. After selecting several representative
   training samples as the reference set, the training data are first
   mapped into a projected space by the reference sample matrix. Then the
   problem of metric learning is casted as a multi-label classification
   problem under the reference-wise constraints, in which an l(2)-norm
   regularised least squares canonical correlation analysis can be used.
   Besides, the formulation is generalised to kernelised version for
   further boosting the performance. Experiments on two benchmark person
   re-identification datasets demonstrate that the approach clearly
   outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Occlusion is a challenging problem in real-time visual object tracking.
   Most state-of-the-art methods learn the inaccurate appearance of the
   target when it becomes occluded by other objects in the scene. To
   address this issue, a novel one-step backtracking (OB) tracker for
   occlusion detection is proposed, which backtracks to one previous frame
   and detects occlusion by comparing the tracking result with OB result in
   each frame. An adaptive learning model update scheme is further proposed
   by computing the peak-to-sidelobe ratio of the response maps to improve
   the tracking performance. Experiments on several benchmark sequences
   show that the proposed tracker outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
   and achieves real-time visual tracking.}},

   As researchers, we are intrigued why few attain significant eminence in

   information from the AMiner Paper Citation and Author Collaboration
   Networks to discern factors that relate to the impact of influential
   researchers across five domains in the computing discipline. We propose
   and apply a novel algorithm to identify influential vertices in
   co-authorship networks built from total corpora of 1,00,000+papers and
   72,000+authors over a span of more than 50 years. The results from our
   study indicate that the impact of these influential researchers relate

Abstract = {{In the classical p-median problem, the objective is to find a set Y of p
   vertices on an undirected graph G = (V, E) in such a way that Y subset
   of V and the sum of distances from all the vertices to their respective

   the weighted case where every vertex in G has either a positive or a
   negative weight under two different objective functions, viz. the sum of
   the minimum weighted distances and the sum of the weighted minimum
   distances. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid artificial bee
   colony (ABC) algorithm for the positive/ negative weighted p-median
   problem where each solution generated by ABC algorithm is improved by an
   interchange based randomized local search. In addition, an interchange
   based exhaustive local search is applied on some of the best solutions
   obtained after the execution of ABC algorithm in a bid to further
   improve their quality. We have compared our approach with the

Abstract = {{Expert systems being computer systems emulate the decision-making
   ability of a human expert, these systems have also enable a human to

   artificial intelligence supports real-time analysis of security threats.
   The drawback of encryption techniques is that, the algorithm of
   encryption techniques may contain some loopholes, which may cause to
   exploit the information security by an intruder and may damage very
   sensitive data. To overcome the classical encryption techniques
   problems, cognitive science has become the inspiration in terms of
   human-like rationality in decision making and logical functionality. In
   cognitive science, it is exposed that human mind is not applying any

   various cognitive correlates such as intention, perception, motivation
   and emotions as security and secrecy phenomenon. In cognitive science,

Title = {{Dynamically weighted evolutionary ordinal neural network for solving an
   imbalanced liver transplantation problem}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{1-11}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Create an efficient decision-support model to assist medical
   experts in the process of organ allocation in liver transplantation. The
   mathematical model proposed here uses different sources of information
   to predict the probability of organ survival at different thresholds for
   each donor recipient pair considered. Currently, this decision is mainly
   based on the Model for End-stage Liver Disease, which depends only on
   the severity of the recipient and obviates donor recipient
   compatibility. We therefore propose to use information concerning the
   donor, the recipient and the surgery, with the objective of allocating
   the organ correctly.
   Methods and materials: The database consists of information concerning
   transplants conducted in 7 different Spanish hospitals and the King's
   College Hospital (United Kingdom). The state of the patients is followed
   up for 12 months. We propose to treat the problem as an ordinal
   classification one, where we predict the organ survival at different
   thresholds: less than 15 days, between 15 and 90 days, between 90 and
   365 days and more than 365 days. This discretization is intended to
   produce finer-grain survival information (compared with the common
   binary approach). However, it results in a highly imbalanced dataset in
   which more than 85\% of cases belong to the last class. To solve this,
   we combine two approaches, a cost-sensitive evolutionary ordinal
   artificial neural network (ANN) (in which we propose to incorporate
   dynamic weights to make more emphasis on the worst classified classes)
   and an ordinal over-sampling technique (which adds virtual patterns to
   the minority classes and thus alleviates the imbalanced nature of the
   dataset).
   Results: The results obtained by our proposal are promising and
   satisfactory, considering the overall accuracy, the ordering of the
   classes and the sensitivity of minority classes. In this sense, both the
   dynamic costs and the over-sampling technique improve the base results
   of the considered ANN-based method. Comparing our model with other
   state-of-the-art techniques in ordinal classification, competitive
   results can also be appreciated. The results achieved with this proposal
   improve the ones obtained by other state-of-the-art models: we were able
   to correctly predict more than 73\% of the transplantation results, with
   a geometric mean of the sensitivities of 31.46\%, which is much higher
   than the one obtained by other models.
   Conclusions: The combination of the proposed cost-sensitive evolutionary
   algorithm together with the application of an over-sampling technique
   improves the predictive capability of our model in a significant way
   (especially for minority classes), which can help the surgeons make more
   informed decisions about the most appropriate recipient for an specific
   donor organ, in order to maximize the probability of survival after the
   transplantation and therefore the fairness principle. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{With the explosion of multimedia data, semantic event detection from
   videos has become a demanding and challenging topic. In addition, when
   the data has a skewed data distribution, interesting event detection
   also needs to address the data imbalance problem. The recent
   proliferation of deep learning has made it an essential part of many
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Till now, various deep learning
   architectures have been proposed for numerous applications such as
   Natural Language Processing (NLP) and image processing. Nonetheless, it
   is still impracticable for a single model to work well for different
   applications. Hence, in this paper, a new ensemble deep learning
   framework is proposed which can be utilized in various scenarios and
   datasets. The proposed framework is able to handle the over-fitting
   issue as well as the information losses caused by single models.
   Moreover, it alleviates the imbalanced data problem in real-world
   multimedia data. The whole framework includes a suite of deep learning
   feature extractors integrated with an enhanced ensemble algorithm based
   on the performance metrics for the imbalanced data. The Support Vector
   Machine (SVM) classifier is utilized as the last layer of each deep
   learning component and also as the weak learners in the ensemble module.
   The framework is evaluated on two large-scale and imbalanced video
   datasets (namely, disaster and TRECVID). The extensive experimental
   results illustrate the advantage and effectiveness of the proposed
   framework. It also demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms
   several well-known deep learning methods, as well as the conventional
   features integrated with different classifiers.}},

Abstract = {{As robots are generally thought to perform human-like tasks, they depend
   on the successes of information technology in the area of artificial
   intelligence to succeed in such pursuits. But robots, through their
   anthropomorphic character and their weighty presence in science fiction,
   attract the attention of the press and the media in a way that, at
   times, blurs the distinction between the actual state of the art and
   exaggerated claims. This makes it hard to assess the true functional
   positioning of robots, how this is likely to move forward and whether
   the outcome of progress could be detrimental to human society. The aim
   of this paper is to review the actual level of competence that is being
   achieved in robotics research laboratories and a plausible impact that
   this is likely to have on human control over life and jobs. The key
   thesis here is that cognition in machines and even an artificial form of
   consciousness lead to operations in a set of tasks (the `algorithmic'
   category) which is different from that available to truly cognitive and
   conscious human beings (the `life-need' category): that is, in the paper
   it is argued that a major category error (Ryle in The concept of mind,
   University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1949) looms in predictions of
   serious threats to humanity. As far as a threat to jobs goes, it is
   argued that early attention to education and re-skilling of humans in
   the workplace can lead to an effective symbiosis between people and
   robots.}},

Title = {{Comparison of inverse modelling and optimization-based methods in the
   heat flux estimation problem of an irradiative dryer/furnace}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{77-85}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{There are two major approaches in sequential (real-time) heat flux
   estimation problems using measured temperatures: (i) development of
   inverse heat transfer models that directly estimate heat flux and (ii)
   use of a combination of a direct heat transfer model (which estimates
   temperature using heat flux information) and an optimization algorithm.
   In physics-based solutions, using thermodynamics and heat transfer laws,
   the first approach is considered ill-posed and challenging, and the
   second approach is more popular. However, the use of artificial
   intelligence (AI) techniques has recently facilitated heat transfer
   inverse modelling, even for complex irradiative systems. Many of the
   claimed advantages of Al inverse models of irradiative systems result
   from the use of AI techniques rather than the inverse modelling
   approach. This research presents a rational comparison between the
   aforementioned approaches for an irradiative thermal system, both using
   AI techniques, for the first time. The results show that inverse models
   are superior because of their higher accuracy and shorter estimation
   delay time. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Neural networks applied to the design of dry-type transformers: an

   quality}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Much of the cost of manufacturing transformers is related to the
   complexity in the development of its project, which involves many
   variables, such as different types of materials, methods, and
   manufacturing processes. Also, it is notoriously difficult to establish
   standards that relate the transformer characteristics with these design
   variables, since each, almost always, variable is calculated
   empirically. One of the most important design variables is the internal
   temperature of the transformers, which directly influences the lifetime
   of such equipments. So, a computational tool is under development whose
   purpose is to automate the design of cast resin dry-type transformers
   and minimize the time taken for its completion, by means of artificial
   neural networks. In this article, we present some results of this tool,
   which relate some geometrical parameters of the specific transformer
   with the temperature of its windings. For this, the winding losses and
   total losses are also estimated. The training of the neural network was
   done with the test data of about 300 dry-type transformers from the same
   manufacturer, so, with the same constructive features. Nevertheless, our
   results show that the technique is promising because the neural networks
   were well fitted and its results present errors lower than 1\% when
   compared with data from tests with real transformers. Evidently, the
   proposed methodology is dependent on the constructive technique; that
   is, once trained, the neural network can be used only in the design of
   dry-type transformers of the same constructive technique as those whose
   results of the tests were used to train the network. Nevertheless, even
   if only used to provide the initial parameters for a more complex design
   tool, the proposed method is useful since it is rapid and has low
   computational cost.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a real-time wide-area damping controller design

   generators. First, energy functions and Prony analysis techniques are
   used to identify these local or interarea oscillations and develop
   stability or damping performance index at a given time. Second,
   artificial neural networks are deployed to learn the dynamics of the
   system and energy functions based on supervised learning to construct an
   optimal control design. Then, using online reinforcement learning the
   quadratic objective function based on the stability index is estimated
   and optimized forward-in-time. Results on the IEEE 68-bus in Power

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{207-240}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, first we present an educational system that assists
   students in learning and tutors in teaching search algorithms, an
   artificial intelligence topic. Learning is achieved through a wide range
   of learning activities. Algorithm visualizations demonstrate the
   operational functionality of algorithms according to the principles of
   active learning. So, a visualization process can stop and request from a
   student to specify the next step or explain the way that a decision was
   made by the algorithm. Similarly, interactive exercises assist students
   in learning to apply algorithms in a step-by-step interactive way.
   Students can apply an algorithm to an example case, specifying the
   algorithm's steps interactively, with the system's guidance and help,
   when necessary. Next, we present assessment approaches integrated in the
   system that aim to assist tutors in assessing the performance of
   students, reduce their marking task workload and provide immediate and
   meaningful feedback to students. Automatic assessment is achieved in
   four stages, which constitute a general assessment framework. First, the
   system calculates the similarity between the student's and the correct
   answer using the edit distance metric. In the next stage, it identifies
   the type of the answer, based on an introduced answer categorization
   scheme related to completeness and accuracy of an answer, taking into
   account student carelessness too. Afterwards, the types of errors are
   identified, based on an introduced error categorization scheme. Finally,
   answer is automatically marked via an automated marker, based on its
   type, the edit distance and the type of errors made. To assess the
   learning effectiveness of the system an extended evaluation study was
   conducted in real class conditions. The experiment showed very
   encouraging results. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of the
   assessment system, we compared the assessment mechanism against expert
   (human) tutors. A total of 400 students' answers were assessed by three
   tutors and the results showed a very good agreement between the
   automatic assessment system and the tutors.}},

Abstract = {{Partition search is a form of game search, proposed by Matthew L.
   Ginsberg in 1996, who wrote that the method ``incorporates dependency
   analysis, allowing substantial reductions in the portion of the tree
   that needs to be expanded.{''} In this paper, some improvements of the
   partition search algorithm are proposed. The effectiveness of the most
   important extension we contribute, which we call local partition search,
   has been verified experimentally. The results obtained (which we present
   in the paper) show that using this extension, leads, in the case of
   bridge, to a significant reduction (almost by half) of the search tree
   size and calculation time. Another extension we proposed allows for more
   effective usage of the transposition table (using it to narrow the
   search window or by cutting more than one entry). Additionally, we
   contribute a formal proof of the correctness of all presented partition
   search variants. We draw conclusions from it about a possible
   generalization of partition search by making the definition of a
   partition system less restrictive. We also provide a formal definition
   of a partition system for the double dummy bridge.}},

   self-motivated agent}},
Journal = {{COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{1-35}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We propose an architecture for self-motivated agents allowing them to
   construct their own knowledge of objects and of geometrical properties
   of space through interaction with their environment. Self-motivation is
   defined here as a tendency to experiment and to respond to behavioral
   opportunities afforded by the environment. Interactions have predefined
   valences that specify inborn behavioral preferences. The long-term goal
   is to design agents that construct their own knowledge of their
   environment through experience, rather than exploiting pre-coded
   knowledge. Over time, the agent learns relations between elements of the
   environment that afford its interactions, and its perception of these
   elements, in the form of data structures called signatures of
   interactions. These signatures allow the agent to attribute a low level
   semantics to elements that constitute its environment based on valences
   of interactions, without predefined knowledge about these elements and
   regardless of the number of element types. Signatures of interaction are
   then used to localize elements in space and to construct data structures
   that characterize spatial properties of space, called signatures of
   places and signatures of presence. Signatures of place and of presence
   characterize space using interactions rather than geometrical or
   topological properties. The agent uses these structures to maintain an
   egocentric representation of affordances of the surrounding environment,
   without any preconception about the elements that compose the
   environment, and without using notions of geometrical space. Experiments
   with simulated agents show that they learn to behave in their
   environment, taking into account multiple surrounding objects, reaching
   or avoiding objects according to the valence of the interactions that
   they afford. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Supermarkets nowadays are equipped with barcode scanners to speed up the
   checkout process. Nevertheless, most of the agricultural products cannot
   be pre-packaged and thus must be weighted. The development of produce
   recognition system based on computer vision could help the cashiers in
   the supermarkets with the pricing of these weighted products. This work
   proposes a hybrid approach of object classification and attribute
   classification for the produce recognition system which involves the
   cooperation and integration of statistical approaches and semantic
   models. The integration of attribute learning into the produce
   recognition system was proposed due to the fact that attribute learning
   has emerged as a promising paradigm for bridging the semantic gap and
   assisting in object recognition in many fields of study. This could
   tackle problems occurred when less training data are available, i.e.
   less than 10 samples per class. The experiments show that the correct
   classification rate of the hybrid approach were 60.55, 75.37 and 86.42\%
   with 2, 4 and 8 training examples, respectively, which were higher than
   other individual classifiers. A well-balanced specificity, sensitivity
   and F-1 score were achieved by the hybrid approach for each produce

Abstract = {{Both neighbourhood preserving embedding (NPE) and sparsity preserving

   which can preserve not only the local neighbourhood information but also
   the sparsely reconstructive relationship. The connection between SSNPE

Abstract = {{Evaluation and benchmarking of skin detectors are challenging tasks
   because of multiple evaluation attributes and conflicting criteria.
   Although several evaluating and benchmarking techniques have been
   proposed, these approaches have many limitations. Fixing several
   attributes based on multi-attribute benchmarking approaches is
   particularly limited to reliable skin detection. Thus, this study aims
   to develop a new framework for evaluating and benchmarking skin
   detection on the basis of artificial intelligent models using
   multi-criteria analysis. For this purpose, two experiments are
   conducted. The first experiment consists of two stages: (1) discussing
   the development of a skin detector using multi-agent learning based on
   different color spaces to create a dataset of various color space
   samples for benchmarking and (2) discussing the evaluation and testing
   the developed skin detector according to multi-evaluation criteria (i.e.
   reliability, time complexity, and error rate within dataset) to create a
   decision matrix. The second experiment applies different decision-making
   techniques (AHP/SAW, AHP/MEW, AHP/HAW, AHP/TOPSIS, AHP/WSM, and AHP/WPM)
   to benchmark the results of the first experiment (i.e. the developed
   skin detector). Then, we discuss the use of the mean, standard
   deviation, and paired sample t-test to measure the correlations among
   the different techniques based on ranking results.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of pier scour can lead to economic design of bridge
   piers and prevent catastrophic incidents. This paper presents the
   application of self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine
   (SAELM) to develop a new model for the prediction of local scour around
   bridge piers using 476 field pier scour measurements with four shapes of
   piers: sharp, round, cylindrical, and square. The model network
   parameters are optimized using the differential evolution algorithm. The
   best SAELM model calculates the scour depth as a function of pier
   dimensions and the sediment mean diameter. The developed SAELM model had
   the lowest error indicators when compared to regression-based
   predictionmodels for root mean square error (RMSE) (0.15, 0.65,
   respectively) and mean absolute relative error (MARE) (0.50, 2.0,
   respectively). The SAELM model was found to perform better than
   artificial neural networks or support vector machines on the same
   dataset. Parametric analysis showed that the new model predictions are
   influenced by pier dimensions and bed-sediment size and produce similar
   trends of variations of scour-hole depth as reported in literature and
   previous experimental measurements. The prediction uncertainty of the
   developed SAELM model is quantified and compared with existing
   regression-based models and found to be the least, +/- 0.03 compared
   with +/- 0.10 for other models.}},

Abstract = {{The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a popular metaheuristic
   that was originally conceived for tackling continuous function
   optimization tasks. Over the last decade, a large number of variants of
   ABC have been proposed, making it by now a well-studied swarm
   intelligence algorithm. Typically, in a paper on algorithmic variants of
   ABC algorithms, one or at most two of its algorithmic components are
   modified. Possible changes include variations on the search equations,
   the selection of candidate solutions to be explored, or the adoption of
   features from other algorithmic techniques. In this article, we propose
   to follow a different direction and to build a generalized ABC
   algorithm, which we call ABC-X. ABC-X collects algorithmic components
   available from known ABC algorithms into a common algorithm framework
   that allows not only to instantiate known ABC variants but, more
   importantly, also many ABC algorithm variants that have never been
   explored before in the literature. Automatic algorithm configuration
   techniques can generate from this template new ABC variants that perform
   better than known ABC algorithms, even when their numerical parameters
   are fine-tuned using the same automatic configuration process.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a stochastic and
   population-based optimization method, whichmimics the collaborative
   foraging behaviour of honey bees and has shown great potential to handle
   various kinds of optimization problems. However, ABC often suffers from
   slow convergence speed since its internal mechanism and solution search
   equation do well in exploration, but badly in exploitation. In order to
   solve this knotty issue, inspired by the natural phenomenon that the
   good individuals (solutions) always contain good genes (variables) and
   the effective combination of the superior genes from different good
   individuals could more easily produce better offspring, we introduce a
   novel gene recombination operator (GRO) into ABC to accelerate
   convergence. To be specific, in GRO, a part of good solutions in the
   current population are selected to produce candidate solutions by the
   gene combination. Especially, each good solution recombines with only
   one other good solution to generate only one candidate solution. In
   addition, GRO will be launched at the end of each generation. In order
   to validate its efficiency and effectiveness, GRO is embedded into nine
   versions of ABC, i.e., the original ABC, GABC, best-so-farABC( BSFABC),
   MABC, CABC, ABCVSS, qABC, dABC and distABC, while yields GRABC, GRGABC,
   GRBSFABC, GRMABC, GRCABC, GRABCVSS, GRqABC, GRdABC and GRdistABC
   respectively. The experimental results on 22 benchmark functions
   demonstrate that GRO could enhance the exploitation ability of ABCs and
   accelerate convergence without loss of diversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Analysis of large-scale traffic dumps in Network Forensics can be a
   complex and non-trivial problem. This is an important step in collecting
   evidences and making threat intelligence to foresee new illegal
   activities. Machine Learning comes into help to automatically support
   decision of forensics expert. Furthermore, application in live systems
   may bring additional obstacles related to forensics readiness and
   knowledge discovery. We believe that it can be mitigated by means of
   Neuro-Fuzzy, a fusion of human-understandable model and automated data
   analytic. This method includes optimal unsupervised grouping of samples
   with so-called Self-Organizing Features Map and fuzzy rules tuning by
   Artificial Neural Network. In this work we propose improvements of the
   methods that makes it possible to extract fewer fuzzy rules in a faster
   manner. The new method has two advantages in comparison to existing.
   First, we improve the estimation of fuzzy patches. Second,
   parameterization that represents the data by incorporating additional
   ellipse compactness information. By using ellipse rotation and
   flattering information, the membership functions can be derived. To even
   further enhance the generalization of the method, the bootstrap
   aggregation was tested during the grouping phase. Finally, the method
   has been assessed on the intrusion detection dataset with a five
   millions samples with classification accuracy 94\% using only 12 rules.

Abstract = {{Real- Time Strategy games are very popular test beds for Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) researchers because they provide complex and
   controlled environments on which to test different AI techniques. In
   this paper we play the role of an external observer that tries to
   predict who is going to win from the events occurring during the game.
   In order to predict the outcome of the game, we model the game states
   using influence maps. Influence maps are numerical matrices representing
   the influence of each player's army in the map, and they are useful for
   different types of spatial reasoning.
   We test different machine learning techniques on two different datasets
   of StarCraft games. The first dataset contains 4-player games in which
   the players are controlled by the internal game AI. The second dataset
   contains 2-player human games from specialized websites. We analyze the
   similarities and differences between both datasets and the performance
   of each algorithm. Finally, we perform a small experiment with expert
   players and conclude that our system reaches a level of precision
   similar to the human judges, although human judges base their
   predictions on a much more complex and abstract set of game features.

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors study the video annotation problem over
   heterogeneous domains, in which data from the image source domain and
   the video target domain is represented by heterogeneous features with
   different dimensions and physical meanings. A novel feature learning
   method, called heterogeneous discriminative analysis of canonical
   correlation (HDCC), is proposed to discover a common feature subspace in
   which heterogeneous features can be compared. The HDCC utilises
   discriminative information from the source domain as well as topology
   information from the target domain to learn two different projection
   matrices. By using these two matrices, heterogeneous data can be
   projected onto a common subspace and different features can be compared.
   They additionally design a group weighting learning framework for
   multi-domain adaptation to effectively leverage knowledge learned from
   the source domain. Under this framework, source domain images are
   organised in groups according to their semantic meanings, and different
   weights are assigned to these groups according to their relevancies to
   the target domain videos. Extensive experiments on the Columbia Consumer
   Video and Kodak datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of their HDCC and

Abstract = {{The knowledge representation and reasoning of both humans and artificial
   systems often involves conditionals. A conditional connects a
   consequence which holds given a precondition. It can be easily
   recognized in natural languages with certain key words, like ``if'' in
   English. A vast amount of literature in both fields, both artificial
   intelligence and psychology, deals with the questions of how such
   conditionals can be best represented and how these conditionals can
   model human reasoning. On the other hand, findings in the psychology of
   reasoning, such as those in the Suppression Task, have led to a paradigm
   shift from the monotonicity assumptions in human inferences towards
   nonmonotonic reasoning. Nonmonotonic reasoning is sensitive for
   information change, that is, inferences are drawn cautiously such that
   retraction of previous information is not required with the addition of
   new information. While many formalisms of nonmonotonic reasoning have
   been proposed in the field of Artificial Intelligence, their capability
   to model properties of human reasoning has not yet been extensively
   investigated. In this paper, we analyzed systematically from both a
   formal and an empirical perspective the power of formal nonmonotonic
   systems to model (i) possible explicit defeaters, as in the Suppression
   Task, and (ii) more implicit conditional rules that trigger nonmonotonic
   reasoning by the keywords in such rules. The results indicated that the
   classical evaluation for the correctness of inferences has to be
   extended in the three major aspects (i) regarding the inference system,
   (ii) the knowledge base, and (iii) possible assumed exceptions for the
   rule.}},

Abstract = {{Deep learning has received significant attention recently as a promising
   solution to many problems in the area of artificial intelligence. Among
   several deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks
   (CNNs) demonstrate superior performance when compared to other machine
   learning methods in the applications of object detection and
   recognition. We use a CNN for image enhancement and the detection of
   driving lanes on motorways. In general, the process of lane detection
   consists of edge extraction and line detection. A CNN can be used to
   enhance the input images before lane detection by excluding noise and
   obstacles that are irrelevant to the edge detection result. However,
   training conventional CNNs requires considerable computation and a big
   dataset. Therefore, we suggest a new learning algorithm for CNNs using
   an extreme learning machine (ELM). The ELM is a fast learning method
   used to calculate network weights between output and hidden layers in a
   single iteration and thus, can dramatically reduce learning time while
   producing accurate results with minimal training data. A conventional
   ELM can be applied to networks with a single hidden layer; as such, we
   propose a stacked ELM architecture in the CNN framework. Further, we
   modify the backpropagation algorithm to find the targets of hidden
   layers and effectively learn network weights while maintaining
   performance. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method is
   effective in reducing learning time and improving performance. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In two separate papers, Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Robotics researcher
   Guy Hoffman takes as a starting point that actors have been in the
   business of reverse engineering human behaviour for centuries. In this
   paper, I follow the similar trajectories of AI and acting theory (AT),
   looking at three primary questions, in the hope of framing a response to
   Hoffman's papers: (1) How are the problems of training a human to
   simulate a fictional human both similar to and different from training a
   machine to simulate a human? (2) How are the larger questions of AI
   design and architecture similar to the larger questions that still
   remain within the area of AT? (3) Is there anything in the work of AI
   design that might advance the work of acting theorists and
   practitioners? The paper explores the use of swarm intelligence in
   recent models of both AT and AI, and considers the issues of embodied
   cognition, and the kinds of intelligence that enhances or inhibits
   imaginative immersion for the actor, and concludes with a consideration
   of the ontological questions raised by the trend towards
   intersubjective, dynamic systems of generative thought in both AT and
   AI.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes that acting is a valuable area of research for the
   fields of Artificial Intelligence and Simulated Behaviour. This
   suggestion is supported through applying theories and findings from the
   field of embodied cognition to the performance pedagogy of French acting
   teacher Jacques Lecoq (1921-1999). Embodied cognition proposes that
   thinking and behaviour are properties of the whole human organism, not
   the brain alone, and that body, brain and cognition are situated -
   engaged with the surrounding environment. This thesis arises from
   findings that show that sensorial and motor experiences form the neural
   foundations for mental concepts and that sensorimotor neural networks
   are partially re-activated by mental and linguistic activity, leading to
   the concept of embodied simulation. I give examples of the ways in which
   Lecoq's conceptualisation of acting technique is implicitly congruent
   with the principles of embodied cognition, and often explicitly
   anticipates its precepts.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling problems containing a mixture of Boolean and numerical
   variables is a long-standing interest of Artificial Intelligence.
   However, performing inference and learning in hybrid domains is a
   particularly daunting task. The ability to model these kinds of domains
   is crucial in ``learning to design{''} tasks, that is, learning
   applications where the goal is to learn from examples how to perform
   automatic de novo design of novel objects. In this paper we present
   Structured Learning Modulo Theories, a max-margin approach for learning
   in hybrid domains based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories, which allows
   to combine Boolean reasoning and optimization over continuous linear
   arithmetical constraints. The main idea is to leverage a
   state-of-the-art generalized Satisfiability Modulo Theory solver for
   implementing the inference and separation oracles of Structured Output
   SVMs. We validate our method on artificial and real world scenarios. (C)

Abstract = {{Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is a relatively new swarm
   intelligence algorithm that has attracted great deal of attention from
   researchers in recent years with the advantage of less control
   parameters and strong global optimization ability. However, there is
   still an insufficiency in ABC regarding its solution search equation,
   which is good at exploration but poor at exploitation. This drawback can
   be even more significant when constraints are also involved. To address
   this issue, an Enhanced Constrained ABC algorithm (EC-ABC) is proposed
   for Constrained Optimization Problems (COPs) where two new solution
   search equations are introduced for employed bee and onlooker bee phases
   respectively. In addition, both chaotic search method and
   opposition-based learning mechanism are employed to be used in
   population initialization in order to enhance the global convergence
   when producing initial population. This algorithm is tested on several
   benchmark functions where the numerical results demonstrate that the
   EC-ABC is competitive with state of the art constrained ABC algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this note, we consider the problem of introducing variables in

   Logic, an extension of Answer Set Programming for dealing with
   linear-time modal operators. To this aim, we provide a definition of a
   first-order version of Temporal Equilibrium Logic that shares the syntax
   of first-order Linear-time Temporal Logic but has different semantics,
   selecting some Linear-time Temporal Logic models we call temporal stable
   models. Then, we consider a subclass of theories (called splittable
   temporal logic programs) that are close to usual logic programs but
   allowing a restricted use of temporal operators. In this setting, we
   provide a syntactic definition of safe variables that suffices to show
   the property of domain independence - that is, addition of arbitrary
   elements in the universe does not vary the set of temporal stable
   models. Finally, we present a method for computing the derivable facts
   by constructing a non-temporal logic program with variables that is fed
   to a standard Answer Set Programming grounder. The information provided
   by the grounder is then used to generate a subset of ground temporal
   rules which is equivalent to (and generally smaller than) the full

Title = {{Measurement forecast of anomalous threshold voltages in BCD LV submicron

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},

Abstract = {{In this study, two intelligent methodologies were used to estimate the
   anomalous threshold-voltage (V-th) measured behaviors in sub-micrometer
   Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) low-voltage (LV) MOSFETs by using the grey
   system (GS) GM (1,1) model and a fuzzy-neural network (FNN). This paper
   describes the implementation procedures of these two models for making
   Vth predictions. Moreover, discrepant comparisons between the GS and FNN
   output data are also derhonstrated. Eventually, only the outputs of FNN
   can have the complex action of reverse short-channel property. Then, it
   Will be developed to analyze the V-th inclination of submicron n-channel
   MOSFETs due to the device geometric effect. A comparison between the
   measured characteristics of V-th and the characteristics of V-th
   predicted by the FNN shows good agreement for a wide range of channel
   lengths, widths and bias conditions. And, the maximum error percentage
   was less than 0.08\%. As such, the developed procedure may be well
   suited for the data estimation of the complicated BSIM-model parameters
   in foundry fabrications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Using Global Constraints to Automate Regression Testing}},
Journal = {{AI MAGAZINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{73-87}},
Month = {{SPR}},
Abstract = {{Communicating or autonomous systems rely on high-quality software-based
   components. that must be thoroughly verified before they are released
   and deployed in operational settings. Regression testing is a crucial
   verification process that compares any new release of a software-based
   component against its previous versions, by executing available test
   cases. However, limited testing time makes selection of test cases in
   regression testing challenging, and some selection criteria must be
   respected. Validation engineers usually address this problem, coined as
   test suite reduction (TSR), through manual analysis or by using
   approximation techniques. In this paper, we address the TSR problem with
   sound artificial intelligence techniques such as constraint programming
   (CP) and global constraints. By using distinct cost-value aggregating
   criteria, we propose several constraint-optimization models to find a
   subset of test cases that cover all the test requirements and optimize
   the overall cost of selected test cases. Our contribution includes reuse
   of existing preprocessing rules to simplify the problem before solving
   it and the design of structure-aware heuristics that take into account
   the notion of the costs associated with test cases. The work presented
   in this paper has been motivated by an industrial application in the
   communication domain. Our overall goal is to develop a constraint based
   approach of test suite reduction that can be deployed to test a complete
   product line of conferencing systems in continuous delivery mode. By
   implementing this approach in a software Prototype tool and
   experimentally evaluating it on both randomly generated and industrial
   instances, we hope to foster a quick adoption of the technology.}},

Abstract = {{Computer systems are a part of everyday life, since they influence human
   behavior and stimulate changes in the emotional states of the users. The
   assessment of users' emotions during their interaction with computer
   systems can help to provide tailorable website interfaces and better
   recommendations systems. However, emotions are complex and difficult to
   identify or assess. Previous studies have shown that, in a real-world
   scenario, the use of single sensors do not provide an accurate emotional
   assessment. Hence, in this study, we propose a framework that takes into
   account multiple sensors so that conclusions can be drawn about the
   emotional state of the user at the time of interaction. The proposed
   multi-sensing approach includes several inputs from users (such as
   speech, facial movements, and everyday activities), and uses an
   artificial intelligent strategy to map these different responses into
   one or more emotional states. The Componential Emotion Theory and
   Scherer's Emotional Semantic Space are used to underpin the theoretical
   framework. The experimental results show that the combination of outputs
   generated by multiple sensors provides a more accurate assessment of
   emotional states than when the sensors are treated individually.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the principles of the Non-singular Terminal Sliding Mode
   Control (NTSMC), a new control law along with an Unscented Kalman Filter
   (UKF) has been proposed for robotic manipulators, that can tolerate
   external disturbances and noises with unknown statistics. First, a
   neural network module has been used as a discontinuous control part of
   the NTSMC to enhance the performance of the controller due to chattering
   phenomenon. Furthermore, a new methodology is proposed which is based on
   a modified evolutionary algorithm (charged systems search) to estimate
   the system states by the UKF and the measurement and process noise
   covariances. To compare this evolutionary method with classical methods,
   an optimal Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithm has been introduced
   that estimates the noise statistics recursively within the algorithm.
   The proposed control method and observer have been simulated on a 6-DOF

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to
   establish a classification and analysis of degraded soils and its
   recovery in response to lime and gypsum application. The analyzed
   degraded soil was classified as Oxisol, and the physical attributes
   considered were: soil density, soil porosity (macroporosity and
   microporosity) and soil penetration resistance. The ANN used in this
   study is the backpropagation composed of two layers, the middle layer
   and the output layer, with supervised training. The network has four
   inputs, that are the physical attributes of the soil, in the middle
   layer the network contains ten neurons and the output layer only one
   neuron, which has the function of informing if the soil was recovered
   (R), partially recovered (PR) or not recovered (NR). The analyzed data
   come from the year 2012, concerning the depths 0.0 - 0.1 m, 0.1 - 0.2 m
   and 0.2 - 0.4 m. Considering the performance of ANN, it was verified
   that the network obtained an adequate training to classify the degraded
   soils, showing low mean square error of analyzed data. Therefore, ANN is
   considered an interesting alternative and a powerful automatic tool to

Abstract = {{The deliberate contamination of food is well recognized as a major
   public health threat. A food supply chain offers several possible
   targets for the intentional insertion of a biological or chemical toxin
   by a perpetrator, which can result in significant morbidity and
   mortality. We assume that both manager (defender) of the food production
   facility and perpetrator (attacker) select actions at each of a possibly
   countable number of decision epochs, based on possibly inaccurate
   real-time observations of the other agent. The defender's objectives are
   to maximize long-run expected total discounted system productivity and
   to minimize the long-run expected total discounted consequence of an
   attack. The attacker's objective is to maximize its reward, which
   combines the long-run expected total discounted consequence of an attack
   with a penalty if the attack is unsuccessful. We model this problem as a
   leader-follower, two-agent partially observed Markov game. We show that
   system risk is dynamic, determine the impact of observation accuracy on
   facility productivity and risk, thus providing a measure of the value of
   information, and perform a sensitivity analysis on key parameters. We
   present an illustrative example involving a liquid egg production
   system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper surveys the literature over the last decades in the field of
   self-organizing multiagent systems. Self-organization has been
   extensively studied and applied in multiagent systems and other fields,
   e.g., sensor networks and grid systems. Self-organization mechanisms in
   other fields have been thoroughly surveyed. However, there has not been
   a survey of self-organization mechanisms developed for use in multiagent
   systems. In this paper, we provide a survey of existing literature on
   self-organization mechanisms in multiagent systems. We also highlight
   the future work on key research issues in multiagent systems. This paper
   can serve as a guide and a starting point for anyone who will conduct
   research on self-organization in multiagent systems. Also, this paper
   complements existing survey studies on self-organization in multiagent
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{In arid and semi-arid regions, documentary data of past floods remain
   justly rare and highly fragmentary in most cases. Existence of many
   effective parameters on maximum flood discharge and the complex
   relationships between them is an important challenge in the
   reconstruction of these data and hence, it limited the application of
   traditional methods. In this paper, an alternative approach (i.e.
   artificial intelligence methods) has been evaluated to determine the
   interactive relations of them. To this end, flow data was collected from
   29 gauging stations in the central part of Iran for the period 1965 to
   2007. Following quality and homogeneity controls of the data,
   reconstruction of instantaneous peak flow time series were made using
   maximum daily data by four different methods; regression method (REG),
   artificial neural network (ANN), genetic algorithm (GA) and adaptive
   neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Results showed that in all studied
   stations, ANFIS reconstructs instantaneous peak flow values with the
   highest accuracy among the four tested methods.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{User acceptance of artificial intelligence agents might depend on their
   ability to explain their reasoning to the users. We focus on a specific
   text processing task, the Semantic Textual Similarity task (STS), where
   systems need to measure the degree of semantic equivalence between two
   sentences. We propose to add an interpretability layer (iSTS for short)
   formalized as the alignment between pairs of segments across the two
   sentences, where the relation between the segments is labeled with a
   relation type and a similarity score. This way, a system performing STS
   could use the interpretability layer to explain to users why it returned
   that specific score for the given sentence pair. We present a publicly
   available dataset of sentence pairs annotated following the
   formalization. We then develop an iSTS system trained on this dataset,
   which given a sentence pair finds what is similar and what is different,
   in the form of graded and typed segment alignments. When evaluated on
   the dataset, the system performs better than an informed baseline,
   showing that the dataset and task are well-defined and feasible. Most
   importantly, two user studies show how the iSTS system output can be
   used to automatically produce explanations in natural language. Users
   performed the two tasks better when having access to the explanations,
   providing preliminary evidence that our dataset and method to
   automatically produce explanations do help users ;understand the output
   of STS systems better. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The extended view of enterprise information systems in the Internet of
   Things (IoT) introduces additional complexity to the interoperability
   problems. In response to this, the problem of systems' interoperability
   is revisited by taking into the account the different aspects of
   philosophy, psychology, linguistics and artificial intelligence, namely
   by analysing the potential analogies between the processes of human and
   system communication. Then, the capability to interoperate as a property
   of the system, is defined as a complex ability to seamlessly sense and
   perceive a stimulus from its environment (assumingly, a message from any
   other system), make an informed decision about this perception and
   consequently, articulate a meaningful and useful action or response,
   based on this decision. Although this capability is defined on the basis
   of the existing interoperability theories, the proposed approach to its
   definition excludes the assumption on the awareness of co-existence of
   two interoperating systems. Thus, it establishes the links between the
   research of interoperability of systems and intelligent software agents,
   as one of the systems' digital identities.}},

Abstract = {{The principle of service composition based on multi-agent is that
   multi-agent can coordinate to reach Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium.
   Reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to deal with the
   coordination problem in cooperative games. In this paper, the
   multi-agent coordination problems in cooperative games for different
   user preference is investigated. In our case, each agent can represent a
   user's preference, and it finally learns a policy that is best fit for
   that user. Most previous works study the deterministic gain of a state.
   However, in practical service environments, the gain may be
   nondeterministic due to unstable Quality of Service (QoS). In addition,
   user preference should be considered. To avoid local optimal solution,
   we let each agent randomly change interacting partners in each
   iteration. Thus, an agent can learn its optimal strategy by interacting
   repeatedly with the rest of agents representing different user
   preference. The experimental results show that our reinforcement
   learning algorithm' outperforms other learning methods. (C) 2016

   Unfortunately, the existing research efforts on SOPs primarily
   concentrate on designing general algorithms for specific problems
   without considering the service domain features. This often leads to
   undesirable results of SOPs. Therefore, how to design a paradigm of
   service domain-oriented optimization algorithms with service domain
   features becomes a challenge for providing optimization strategies and
   algorithms to solve SOPs effectively. By considering the influences of
   service domain features on solving SOPs, this paper proposes a set of
   service domain oriented artificial bee colony algorithms (S-ABC) based
   on the optimization mechanism of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) method.
   Furthermore, by configuring the items and parameters of the S-ABC
   paradigm in detail, optimization algorithms for particular SOPs (e.g.,
   service selection and composition) could be derived. In this paper, the
   superiority of our proposed S-ABC is verified through solving concurrent
   service selection and service composition problem. By exploiting the
   artificial bee colony algorithms for the optimization problems in
   service domains, this work makes novel contributions for solving SOPs,
   as well as extends the theory of the swarm intelligence optimization.

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the trajectory-tracking control problem of mobile
   robot systems with nonholonomic constraints, in the presence of
   time-varying parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. This
   necessitates an accurate controller to meet as much control objectives,
   as possible. Therefore, this paper deals with an artificial intelligence
   control technique to design a robust controller to meet the control
   objectives. The design of the intelligent controller is based on the
   optimal control theory, the adaptive neural network system, and the
   robust control technique. The trajectory-tracking problem is solved
   using the optimal control methodology. Since the nonholonomic wheeled
   mobile robot is strongly nonlinear, the neural network system is applied
   to approximate the nonlinear function in the optimal control law. The
   robust controller, for his part, is then applied to adaptively estimate
   an unknown upper bound of the time-varying parametric uncertainties,
   external disturbances and approximation error of the neural network
   system. The stability of the closed-loop robot system is proven using
   the optimal control theory and Lyapunov stability analysis. The results
   of the simulation studies on three typical nonholonomic mobile robots
   are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   controller. In addition, a comparative study with a recent robust
   adaptive controller shows that our proposed intelligent controller gives
   better results, in the sense that the output trajectory converges to the
   steady state faster with smaller tracking error.}},

Title = {{A knowledge model for the development of a framework for hypnogram
   construction}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{140-151}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{We describe a proposal of a knowledge model for the development of a
   framework for hypnogram construction from intelligent analysis of
   pulmonology and electrophysiological signals. Throughout the twentieth
   century, after the development of electroencephalography (EEG) by Hans
   Berger, there have been multiple studies on human sleep and its
   structure. Polysomnography (PSG), a sleep study from several
   biophysiological variables, gives us the hypnogram, a graphic
   representation of the stages of sleep as a function of time. This graph,
   when analyzed in conjunction with other physiological parameters, such
   as the heart rate or the amount of oxygen in arterial blood, has become
   a valuable diagnostic tool for different clinical problems that can
   occur during sleep and that often cause poor quality sleep. Currently,
   the gold standard for the detection of sleep events and for the correct
   classification of sleep stages are the rules published by the American
   Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), version 2.2. Based on the standards
   available to date, different studies on methods of automatic analysis of
   sleep and its stages have been developed but because of the different
   development and validation procedures used in existing methods, a
   rigorous and useful comparative analysis of results and their ability to
   correctly classify sleep stages is not possible. In this sense, we
   propose an approach that ensures that sleep stage classification task is
   not affected by the method for extracting PSG features and events. This
   approach is based on the development of a knowledge-intensive base
   system (KBS) for classifying sleep stages and building the corresponding
   hypnogram. For this development we used the CommonKADS methodology, that
   has become a de facto standard for the development of KBSs. As a result,
   we present a new knowledge model that can be used for the subsequent
   development of an intelligent system for hypnogram construction that
   allows us to isolate the process of signal processing to identify sleep
   stages so that the hypnograms obtained become comparable, independently
   of the signal analysis techniques. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Value sensitive design is driven by the motivation of making social and
   moral values central to the development of ICT systems. Among the most
   challenging concerns when imparting shared values like accountability,
   transparency, liberty, fairness and trust into information technology
   are reliable and comprehensive formal and computational models of those
   values. This paper, educated by trust theories and models from cognitive
   science, social sciences and artificial intelligence, proposes a novel
   stochastic computational model of trust, encapsulating abstractions of
   human cognitive capabilities and empirically evidenced social
   interaction patterns. Qualitative and quantitative features of trust are
   identified, upon which our formal model is phrased. Reality mining
   methods are used to validate the model based on a real life community
   dataset. We analyze the time-varying dynamics of the interaction and
   communication patterns of the community, consider varying types of
   relationships as well as their symmetry. Social network data analysis
   shows that our model better fits the evolved friendships compared to a
   well designed synthetic trust model, which is used as the baseline.}},

Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{Tensor analysis has reached a celebrity status in the areas of machine
   learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Completing and
   recovering tensor is an important problem for tensor analysis. It
   involves recovering a tensor from either a subset of its entries or the
   whole entries contaminated by noise. Classical tensor
   completion/recovery methods are based mainly on l(2)-norm (Gaussian
   distribution noise) models, and are sensitive to noise of large
   magnitude. While l(1)-norm (Laplacian distribution noise) based methods
   are robust to noise of large magnitude, they do not deal with dense
   noise effectively. In this paper, we present a novel Cauchy tensor
   decomposition method for simultaneously recovering and completing a low
   rank tensor with both missing data and complex noise. We utilize the
   Cauchy distribution to model noise and derive the objective function of
   Cauchy tensor decomposition under the maximum likelihood estimation
   (MLE) framework. Then we developed a robust tensor decomposition
   framework that used first-order optimization approaches to optimize the
   objective function. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted and
   show that our method is able to successfully recover and complete
   tensors with large/dense noise and missing data. We further demonstrate
   the usefulness of Cauchy tensor decomposition on three real-world
   applications, image inpainting, traffic data process and
   foreground/background separation. The experimental results show that the
   method is applicable to a wide range of problems.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of ubiquitous computing is to create ambience in which one's
   experiences and quality of life are improved by monitoring and assisting
   people using ubiquitous technologies and computation in coherence. The
   continuous advancements of involved technologies, such as wireless
   communications, mobile devices, and sensors, imply fast evolution of
   ubiquitous computing environments too. The complexity of these
   environments is reaching a point where traditional solutions simply no
   longer work. The environments are in need of computational techniques
   that can deal with the evolution and uncertainty of ubiquitous computing
   environments dynamically and automatically. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   can contribute towards satisfying this future scenario in many ways,
   while numerous approaches inspired by work in the AI planning community
   have already been designed for ubiquitous computing. We devote this
   study to investigate the current progress of AI planning for ubiquitous
   computing by analysing those approaches. We rigorously search for and
   select relevant literature out of which we extract qualitative
   information. Using the extracted qualities, we derive a generic
   framework that consists of aspects important to planning for ubiquitous
   computing. The framework's main purpose is to facilitate the
   understanding of those aspects, and classify the literature according to
   them. We then analyse the literature in a consolidated way, and identify

Abstract = {{A major challenge facing all law-enforcement organizations is to
   accurately and efficiently analyze the growing volumes of crime data in
   order to extract useful knowledge for decision makers. This is an
   increasingly important task, considering the fast growth of urban
   populations in most countries. In particular, to reconcile urban growth
   with the need for security, a fundamental goal is to optimize the
   allocation of law enforcement resources. Moreover, optimal allocation
   can only be achieved if we can predict the incidence of crime within
   different urban areas. To answer this call, in this paper we propose an
   artificial intelligence system for predicting per capita violent crimes
   in urban areas starting from socio-economic data, law-enforcement data
   and other crime-related data obtained from different sources. The
   proposed framework blends a recently developed version of genetic
   programming that uses the concept of semantics during the search process
   with a local search method. To analyze the appropriateness of the
   proposed computational method for crime prediction, different urban
   areas of the United States have been considered. Experimental results
   confirm the suitability of the proposed method for addressing the
   problem at hand. In particular, the proposed method produces a lower
   error with respect to the existing state-of-the art techniques and it is
   particularly suitable for analyzing large amounts of data. This is an
   extremely important feature in a world that is currently moving towards
   the development of smart cities.}},

Title = {{Temporal detection and analysis of guideline interactions}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{40-62}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are assuming a major
   role in the medical area, to grant the quality of medical assistance,
   supporting physicians with evidence-based information of interventions
   in the treatment of single pathologies. The treatment of patients
   affected by multiple diseases (comorbid patients) is one of the main
   challenges for the modern healthcare. It requires the development of new
   methodologies, supporting physicians in the treatment of interactions
   between CPGs. Several approaches have started to face such a challenging
   problem. However, they suffer from a substantial limitation: they do not
   take into account the temporal dimension. Indeed, practically speaking,
   interactions occur in time. For instance, the effects of two actions
   taken from different guidelines may potentially conflict, but practical
   conflicts happen only if the times of execution of such actions are such
   that their effects overlap in time.
   Objectives: We aim at devising a methodology to detect and analyse
   interactions between CPGs that considers the temporal dimension.
   Methods: In this paper, we first extend our previous ontological model
   to deal with the fact that actions, goals, effects and interactions
   occur in time, and to model both qualitative and quantitative temporal
   constraints between them. Then, we identify different application
   scenarios, and, for each of them, we propose different types of
   facilities for user physicians, useful to support the temporal detection
   of interactions.
   Results: We provide a modular approach in which different Artificial
   Intelligence temporal reasoning techniques, based on temporal constraint
   propagation, are widely exploited to provide users with such facilities.
   We applied our methodology to two cases of comorbidities, using
   simplified versions of CPGs.
   Conclusion: We propose an innovative approach to the detection and
   analysis of interactions between CPGs considering different sources of
   temporal information (CPGs, ontological knowledge and execution logs),
   which is the first one in the literature that takes into account the
   temporal issues, and accounts for different application scenarios. (C)

Abstract = {{Video games are a peculiar medium, standing at the crossing point
   between art and software application, and characterized by an active
   involvement of its audience. The complexity of the product generates a
   huge challenge for the companies that develop video games. In the
   development process, level designers play a crucial role: they are in
   charge of declining the theoretical framework developed by the game
   designer into game levels, which contain the actual gameplay scenarios.
   Hence, the final goal of any level designer is to valorize the game
   design by creating enjoyable gaming experiences while, at the same time,
   respecting several constraints. To lighten the burden on level
   designers, several semi-automated approaches to level generation have
   appeared in time, but the majority of these tools suffer from several
   drawbacks. In the present work, we tackle the issue of designing,
   prototyping and testing FUN PLEdGE, a general-purpose automated levels
   generator and editor for platform video games. Its main goal is to
   shrink development time while producing - unassisted - levels that are
   both playable and fun. Moreover, our tool provides the maximum freedom
   to the level designer, by avoiding to impose unnecessary constraints on
   the structure of the levels and by guaranteeing the possibility to
   modify and personalize by hand the generated levels. During this
   process, the generator assists the designer by suggesting corrections
   functional to the quality of the player experience. To prove the
   effectiveness of our prototypal application we have also developed and
   tested with players a platform game. In the same vein, we asked to a
   group of game developers to test FUN PLEdGE.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the results of experimental research, and
   artificial intelligence methods focused on determination of compressive
   strength of lightweight cement mortar with silica fume and fly ash after

   machine were selected as artificial intelligence methods. Lightweight
   cement mortar mixtures containing silica fume and fly ash were prepared
   in this study. After specimens were cured in 20 +/- 2 degrees C waters
   for 28 days, the specimens were cured in different sulfate
   concentrations (0\%, 1\% MgSO4-2, 2\% MgSO4-2, and 4\% MgSO4-2 for 28,
   60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 365 days. At the end of these curing
   periods, the compressive strengths of lightweight cement mortars were
   tested. The input variables for the artificial neural network and the
   support vector machine were selected as the amount of cement, the amount
   of fly ash, the amount of silica fumes, the amount of aggregates, the
   sulfate percentage, and the curing time. The compressive strength of the
   lightweight cement mortar was the output variable. The model results
   were compared with the experimental results. The best prediction results
   were obtained from the artificial neural network model with the

Abstract = {{One of the problems that the IT auditor has when expressing an opinion
   about a finding is the subjectivity that can be due to many aspects,
   among the main ones: emotional, technical skills or abilities with which
   this opinion can be right or wrong. This is a major problem because the
   audit report issued may have distortions of the facts. On the other
   hand, the development of the expert systems involves capturing the
   knowledge of the human and transferring it to a computer program in
   which all the characteristics of this knowledge are emulated and
   considering a group of rules, the system can make decisions as a human
   does. Advances in artificial intelligence over the last few years have
   led to the development of these knowledge-based systems increasing and
   the results obtained are more real. The use of these systems presents a
   promising future in the field of computer audit. The objective of this
   article is to give a general idea of the characterization and use of
   knowledge based systems, the way they are implemented and their
   application to the audit of information systems as a tool to help the
   opinion issue at the moment of realization of an audit.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in artificial intelligence and computer graphics digital
   technologies have contributed to a relative increase in realism in
   virtual characters. Preserving virtual characters' communicative
   realism, in particular, joined the ranks of the improvements in natural
   language technology, and animation algorithms. This paper focuses on
   culturally relevant paralinguistic cues in nonverbal communication. We
   model the effects of an Englishspeaking digital character with different
   accents on human interactants (i. e., users). Our cultural influence
   model proposes that paralinguistic realism, in the form of accented
   speech, is effective in promoting culturally congruent cognition only
   when it is self-relevant to users. For example, a Chinese or Middle
   Eastern English accent may be perceived as foreign to individuals who do
   not share the same ethnic cultural background with members of those
   cultures. However, for individuals who are familiar and affiliate with
   those cultures (i. e., in-group members who are bicultural), accent not
   only serves as a motif of shared social identity, it also primes them to
   adopt culturally appropriate interpretive frames that influence their

Abstract = {{Surface roughness is a major concern to the present manufacturing sector
   without the wastage of material. Hence, in order to achieve good surface
   roughness and reduce production time, optimization is necessary. In this
   study optimization techniques based on swarm intelligence (SI) namely
   firefly algorithm (FA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a newly
   introduced metaheuristic algorithm namely bat algorithm(BA) has been
   implemented for optimizing machining parameters namely cutting speed,
   feed rate, depth of cut and tool flank wear and cutting tool vibrations
   in order to achieve minimum surface roughness. Two parameters R-a and
   R-t have been considered for evaluating the surface roughness. The
   performance of BA algorithm has been compared with FA algorithm and PSO,
   which is a commonly and widely used optimization algorithm in machining.
   The results conclude that BA produces better optimization, when compared
   to FA and PSO. Based on the literature review carried out, this work is
   a first attempt at using a metaheuristic algorithm namely BA in
   machining applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   functionalities involved in poetry generation systems to better serve
   the challenge of working toward a yet unknown successful computational

   considering how some of the processes currently modeled in existing
   systems for poetry generation might be deconstructed into a set of
   services susceptible of being recombined in different ways to be
   integrated in other developments. Building on prior attempts to propose
   an evolutionary architecture that allows integration of a number of

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Lung vessel segmentation of computed tomography (CT) images is important
   in clinical practise and challenging due to difficulties associated with
   minor size and blurred edges of lung vessels. A vessel segmentation
   method is proposed for lung images based on a random forest classifier
   and sparse auto-encoder features. First, the multi-scale representations
   of lung images are obtained using the Gaussian pyramid. Second, a sparse
   auto-encoder of three layers is trained using randomly selected patches
   of these images. Next, the trained weight of the sparse auto-encoder is
   used as the convolution kernel to extract features of different scale
   images. Finally, a random forest classifier is exploited to segment the
   vessels. The proposed method was evaluated on the original and
   noise-added VESSEL12 dataset that is publicly available. Comparison with
   some classical methods and existing machine learning methods shows that
   the proposed method reaches the state-of-the-art accuracy. The results
   also show that a shallow neural network is a powerful feature extraction

Abstract = {{The exoskeletons are robotic active orthoses intended to enhance power
   or in medical applications as rehabilitation and assistive walking. In
   the context of designing a controller for the reconfigurable exoskeleton
   for lower limb, it is critical to define the hardware as well as the
   control. The scope of this work was to define the controller for
   reconfigurable exoskeleton using three types of controllers: PD, ANFIS,
   and MPC. The PD controllers are the typical approach for torque/tracking
   control while artificial intelligence controller, as ANFIS, and optimal
   controller, as MPC, are recently entering to this field. The ANFIS and
   MPC controllers may bring more precision and capability to distribute
   the processing operations. Afterward, this work contrasts the
   performance evaluation using objective indices to evaluate the error,
   ISE, IAE, ITSE, ITAE, ISTSE, and ISTAE. The results suggest that ANFIS
   and MPC controllers have the potential to drive the torque/traction
   reducing the error while having the capability to learn from the
   disturbances from the surroundings.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new forecasting model based on artificial immune system
   (AIS) is proposed. The model is used for short-term electrical load
   forecasting as an example of forecasting time series with multiple
   seasonal cycles. Artificial immune system learns to recognize antigens
   (AGs) representing two fragments of the time series: 1) fragment
   preceding the forecast (input vector) and 2) forecasted fragment (output
   vector). Antibodies as recognition units recognize AGs by selected
   features of input vectors and learn output vectors. In the test
   procedure, new AG with only input vector is recognized by some
   antibodies (ABs). Its output vector is reconstructed from activated ABs.
   The unique feature of the proposed AIS is the embedded property of local
   feature selection. Each AB learns in the clonal selection process its
   optimal subset of features (a paratope) to improve its recognition and
   prediction abilities. In the simulation studies the proposed model was
   tested on real power system data and compared with other AIS-based
   forecasting models as well as neural networks, autoregressive integrated
   moving average, and exponential smoothing. The obtained results confirm
   good performance of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{Smart homes reduce human intervention in controlling the heating
   ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for maintaining a
   comfortable indoor environment. The embedded intelligence in the sensor
   nodes is limited due to the limited processing power and memory in the
   sensor node. Cloud computing has become increasingly popular due to its
   capability of providing computer utilities as internet services. In this
   study, a model for the intelligent controller by integrating internet of
   things (IoT) with cloud computing and web services is proposed. The
   wireless sensor nodes for monitoring the indoor environment and HVAC
   inlet air, and wireless base station for controlling the actuators of
   HVAC have been developed. The sensor nodes and base station communicate
   through RF transceivers at 915 MHz. Random neural network (RNN) models
   are used for estimating the number of occupants, and for estimating the
   predicted-mean-vote-based setpoints for controlling the heating,
   ventilation, and cooling of the building. Three test cases are studied
   (Case 1-Data storage and implementation of RNN models on the cloud, Case
   2-RNN models implementation on base station, Case 3-Distributed
   implementation of RNN models on sensor nodes and base stations) for
   determining the best architecture in terms of power consumption. The
   results have shown that by embedding the intelligence in the base
   station and sensor nodes (i.e., Case 3), the power consumption of the
   intelligent controller was 4.4\% less than Case 1 and 19.23\% less than
   Case 2.}},

Abstract = {{Citation and coauthor networks offer an insight into the dynamics of
   scientific progress. We can also view them as representations of a
   causal structure, a logical process captured in a graph. From a causal
   perspective, we can ask questions such as whether authors form groups
   primarily due to their prior shared interest, or if their favourite
   topics are `contagious' and spread through co-authorship. Such networks
   have been widely studied by the artificial intelligence community, and
   recently a connection has been made to nonlocal correlations produced by
   entangled particles in quantum physics-the impact of latent hidden
   variables can be analyzed by the same algebraic geometric methodology
   that relies on a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations.
   Following this trail, we treat our sample coauthor network as a causal
   graph and, using SDP relaxations, rule out latent homophily as a
   manifestation of prior shared interest only, leading to the observed
   patternedness. By introducing algebraic geometry to citation studies, we
   add a new tool to existing methods for the analysis of content-related
   social influences.}},

Abstract = {{A new algorithm, ACORS-ANNDPF for WSNs, is proposed in this paper to
   improve the utilization rate of WSNs and prolong the life cycle of the
   IoT. Developed on the basis of ant colony algorithm, the improved
   algorithm is applicable to the selection of the optimal path and
   identification of the optimal routing node in the case of losing the
   routing node. To reduce the time spent on transferring network packets,
   the indices are selected by the neural network algorithm in light of the
   actual application environment and adjusted to optimize the fusion of
   packet data. After that, the author carries out several simulation
   experiments and compares the proposed algorithm with other algorithms.
   The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm ensures high energy
   efficiency and balanced energy consumption. Therefore, it is concluded
   that the proposed algorithm can improve network utilization rate and
   lead to better network transmission performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors propose a fast method for single image
   super-resolution (SR). The relation between high-resolution
   (HR)/low-resolution (LR) patches is learned using the input image and a
   down-sampled version. They divide the input image into a number of equal
   blocks. For each image block, a pair of HR/LR dictionaries, using
   informative patches, are constructed. For each patch in the input image,
   an HR dictionary is constructed by concatenating the HR dictionary which
   it belongs and the HR dictionaries of eight neighbouring blocks. In the
   same manner, an LR dictionary for each patch is constructed. They
   represent each patch from the input image using a linear combination of
   atoms in its LR dictionary. Then, using the same combination for atoms
   in the HR dictionary of patch, the SR version for the patch is
   constructed. The computational complexity of the proposed method is
   considerably low because, in contrast to most of the existing methods,
   no learning phase, for building the dictionaries of a patch, is
   required. The experimental results of the proposed method is
   significantly faster than existing methods, whereas the performance in
   terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity criterions
   is comparable with the existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) is a novel swarm intelligence optimization
   algorithm that has been shown to be effective in solving high
   dimensional global optimization problem with good performance for its
   excellent exploration capability. It has received a great deal of
   attentions of researchers since it was proposed, and was employed to
   many application fields for its advantages of excellent global
   optimization ability and easy to implement. However, the basic ABC has
   some drawbacks like poor exploitation and slow convergence. In this
   paper, an improved artificial bee colony algorithm based on
   modified-neighborhood-based update operator and
   independent-inheriting-search strategy for global optimization called
   MNIIABC algorithm is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, a
   modified-neighborhood-based update operator, which contains a
   global-best term and a subset-best guided term, is applied in the
   employed bee stage to balance the exploration and exploitation. Aiming
   to improve the solution diversity, a subset partition method for
   producing perturbation term is considered. In order to enhance the
   exploitation of the algorithm, an independent-inheriting-search strategy
   is used in the onlooker stage. Experiment results tested on multiple
   benchmark functions show that the proposed method is effective, and has
   good performance. The comparison experimental results illustrate that
   the proposed algorithm has good solution quality and convergence
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Today's multiple degree-of-freedom myoelectric prosthesis relies only on
   direct control by the processed electromyographic signal. However, it is
   difficult for the wearer to learn unnatural muscle contractions in order
   to wield more than three DoFs of the arm. This makes it almost
   impossible to use more complex prostheses with a larger number of
   actuators. Methods based on sensor-actuator loop and artificial
   intelligence may reduce cognitive load of the user by removing low level
   control, and an intelligent control system would make it needless to
   micromanage every action. For this purpose, sensor system for body
   segments motion capture was developed, as well as sensor system for
   prosthetic limb's environment motion capture. Neural networks were
   designed to process data from the sensor systems. For the identification
   of the knee angle, orientation trackers were used. Neural network
   predictor of arm positions predicts the shoulder angle using the
   information about movement of the lower limb. In the case of the
   periodic/cyclic movements of the legs, such as walking, the control unit
   uses typical movement patterns of the healthy upper limb. Ultrasonic
   range sensors are used to create 3D map of objects in the environment
   around the arm. Neural network predictor of object positions predicts
   collisions. If the potential collisions are identified, the control unit
   stops arm movement. The new methods were verified by MATLAB and are
   designed as a part of assistive technology for disabled people and are
   to be understood as an original contribution to the investigation of new
   prosthesis control units and international debate on the design of new
   myoelectric prostheses.}},

Abstract = {{A method for tuning a static var compensator for voltage control and
   reduction of harmonic distortion in a microgrid is presented in this
   paper. Electrical power distribution systems face a new scenario with an
   increasing number of distributed generation sources, nonlinear loads and
   more strict power quality requirements. In addition, it can be observed
   that there is a tendency for power systems to operate within the context
   of smartgrids. Consequently, the operation of such systems become more
   complex and, therefore, requires a power quality conditioning technique
   able to adapt itself to the grid. The application of a static var
   compensator with an additional filtering function at the point of common
   coupling of a power system with a microgrid is a possible solution. In
   this context, the proposed approach is based on artificial neural
   networks to determine the static var compensator tuning in order to
   recognize the loading and distributed generation steady-state
   conditions. Simulation results show that this approach provides the
   control system with more intelligence and the capability of adapting to
   different operating conditions.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Software cybernetics research is to apply a variety of techniques from
   cybernetics research to software engineering research. For more than
   fifteen years since 2001, there has been a dramatic increase in work
   relating to software cybernetics. From cybernetics viewpoint, the work
   is mainly on the first-order level, namely, the software under
   observation and control. Beyond the first-order cybernetics, the
   software, developers/users, and running environments influence each
   other and thus create feedback to form more complicated systems. We
   classify software cybernetics as Software Cybernetics I based on the
   first-order cybernetics, and as Software Cybernetics II based on the
   higher order cybernetics. This paper provides a review of the literature
   on software cybernetics, particularly focusing on the transition from
   Software Cybernetics I to Software Cybernetics II. The results of the
   survey indicate that some new research areas such as Internet of Things,
   big data, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, and even creative
   computing are related to Software Cybernetics II. The paper identifies
   the relationships between the techniques of Software Cybernetics II
   applied and the new research areas to which they have been applied,
   formulates research problems and challenges of software cybernetics with
   the application of principles of Phase II of software cybernetics;
   identifies and highlights new research trends of software cybernetic for
   further research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{123-135}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel approach for computing the Pareto
   frontier in Multi-Objective Markov Chains Problems (MOMCPs) that
   integrates a regularized penalty method for poly-linear functions. In
   addition, we present a method that make the Pareto frontier more useful
   as decision support system: it selects the ideal multi-objective option
   given certain bounds. We restrict our problem to a class of finite,
   ergodic and controllable Markov chains. The regularized penalty approach
   is based on the Tikhonov's regularization method and it employs a
   projection-gradient approach to find the strong Pareto policies along
   the Pareto frontier. Different from previous regularized methods, where
   the regularizator parameter needs to be large enough and modify (some
   times significantly) the initial functional, our approach balanced the
   value of the functional using a penalization term (.t) and the
   regularizator parameter (3) at the same time improving the computation
   of the strong Pareto policies. The idea is to optimize the parameters Ic
   and S such that the functional conserves the original shape. We set the
   initial value and then decrease it until each policy approximate to the
   strong Pareto policy. In this sense, we define exactly how the
   parameters pc and S tend to zero and we prove the convergence of the
   gradient regularized penalty algorithm. On the other hand, our
   policy-gradient multi-objective algorithms exploit a gradient-based
   approach so that the corresponding image in the objective space gets a
   Pareto frontier of just strong Pareto policies. We experimentally
   validate the method presenting a numerical example of a real alternative
   solution of the vehicle routing planning problem to increase security in
   transportation of cash and valuables. The decision-making process
   explored in this work correspond to the most frequent computational
   intelligent models applied in practice within the Artificial
   Intelligence research area. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Optimizing network attacks by artificial bee colony}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{377}},
Pages = {{30-50}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Over the past few years, the task of conceiving effective attacks to
   complex networks has arisen as an optimization problem. Attacks are
   modelled as the process of removing a number k of vertices, from the
   graph that represents the network, and the goal is to maximise or
   minimise the value of a predefined metric over the graph. In this work,
   we present an optimization problem that concerns the selection of nodes
   to be removed to minimise the maximum betweenness centrality value of
   the residual graph. This metric evaluates the participation of the nodes
   in the communications through the shortest paths of the network.
   To address the problem we propose an artificial bee colony algorithm,
   which is a swarm intelligence approach inspired in the foraging
   behaviour of honeybees. In this framework, bees produce new candidate
   solutions for the problem by exploring the vicinity of previous ones,
   called food sources. The proposed method exploits useful problem
   knowledge in this neighbourhood exploration by considering the partial
   destruction and heuristic reconstruction of selected solutions. The
   performance of the method, with respect to other models from the
   literature that can be adapted to face this problem, such as sequential
   centrality-based attacks, module-based attacks, a genetic algorithm, a
   simulated annealing approach, and a variable neighbourhood search, is
   empirically shown. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Accelerating bio-inspired optimizer with transfer reinforcement learning
   for reactive power optimization}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{26-38}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel accelerating bio-inspired optimizer (ABO)
   associated with transfer reinforcement learning (TRL) to solve the
   reactive power optimization (RPO) in large-scale power systems. A memory
   matrix is employed to represent the memory of different state-action
   pairs, which is used for knowledge learning, storage, and transfer among
   different optimization tasks. Then an associative memory is introduced
   to significantly reduce the dimension of memory matrix, in which more
   than one element can be simultaneously updated by the cooperating
   multi-bion. The win or learn fast policy hill-climbing (WOLF-PHC) is
   also used to accelerate the convergence. Thus, ABO can rapidly seek the
   closest solution to the exact global optimum by exploiting the prior
   knowledge of the source tasks according to their similarities. The
   performance of ABO has been evaluated for RPO on IEEE 118-bus system and
   IEEE 300 bus system, respectively. Simulation results verify that ABO
   outperforms the existing artificial intelligence algorithms in terms of
   global convergence ability and stability, which can raise one order of
   magnitude of the convergence rate than that of others. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Neural network-based multi-agent approach for scheduling in distributed
   systems}},
Journal = {{CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE \& EXPERIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{A distributed system consists of a collection of autonomous
   heterogeneous resources that provide resource sharing and a common
   platform for running parallel compute-intensive applications. The
   different application characteristics combined with the heterogeneity
   and performance variations of the distributed system make it difficult
   to find the optimal set of needed resources. When deployed, user
   applications are usually handled by application domain experts or system
   administrators who depending on the infrastructure provide a scheduling
   strategy for selecting the best candidate resource over a set of
   available resources. However, the provided strategy is usually generic,
   aimed at handling a wide array of applications and does not take into
   consideration specific application resource requirements. As such, an
   intelligent method for selecting the best resources based on expert
   knowledge is needed. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based
   multi-agent resource selection technique capable of mimicking the
   services of an expert user. In addition, to cope with the geographical
   distribution of the underlying system, we employ a multi-agent
   coordination mechanism. The proposed neural network-based scheduling
   framework combined with the multi-agent intelligence is a unique
   approach to efficiently deal with the resource selection problem.
   Results run on a simulated environment show the efficiency of our
   proposed method. Several scheduling simulations were conducted to
   compare the performance of some conventional resource selection methods
   against the proposed agent-based neural network technique. The results
   obtained indicate that the agent-based approach outperformed the
   classical algorithms by reducing the amount of time required to search
   for suitable resources irrespective of the resource size. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Discovery of (strong) association rules, or implications, is an
   important task in data management, and it finds application in
   artificial intelligence, data mining and the semantic web. We introduce
   a novel approach for the discovery of a specific set of implications,

   table, based on the structure of its Galois lattice. At the core of the
   method are the D-relation defined in a lattice theoretic framework and
   the hypergraph dualization algorithm that allows us to effectively
   produce the set of transversals for a given Sperner hypergraph. The
   latter algorithm, first developed by specialists from Rutgers Center for
   Operations Research, has already found numerous applications in solving
   optimization problems in data base theory, artificial intelligence and
   game theory. One application of the method is for analysis of gene
   expression data related to a particular phenotypic variable, and some

Journal = {{ELECTRONICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{20-21}},
Month = {{JAN 5}},
Abstract = {{Self-similarity is an attractive image property that has been
   successfully applied to object recognition due to its robustness to
   severe target appearance variations. However, less attention has been
   paid to explore self-similarity for visual tracking, mainly because it
   is difficult to learn self-similarity information between different
   features suitable for visual tracking. To address this issue, a simple,
   yet effective approach is presented to learn self-similarity information
   among the local features extracted from the different regions of the
   target. The target is first divided into some non-overlapping regions,
   in which each region is described by the histogram of gradient (HOG)
   features. Then, an explicit polynomial kernel feature map is
   constructed, which is capable of characterising the self-similarity
   information among all the local regions in the targets. Finally, based
   on the feature maps, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is learnt via
   an online dual coordinate descent method that offers fast convergence
   guarantee. Experiments on a large tracking benchmark dataset with 50
   sequences demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over
   state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, bio-inspired computational intelligence is exploited to
   analyze the nonlinear vibrational dynamics of rotating electrical
   machine (VD-REM) model by applying artificial neural networks (ANN5),
   genetic algorithms (GAs) and active-set methods (ASMs). The
   superintended mathematical relation of VD-REM is modeled with ANN5 by
   employing an unsupervised error function. Design parameters of the
   networks are trained with meta-heuristic approach based on GAs, used as
   a tool for effective global search method, hybrid with ASM for efficient
   local search. The design scheme is evaluated for VD-REM models by taking
   different values of shaft stiffness along with an amplitude of force and
   parametric excitations. The performance of the proposed scheme is
   validated through the comparison of results from Adam numerical method
   with the help of different measures based on mean absolute derivation,
   root mean square error, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Document image analysis and recognition are important topics in the

   samples. In this work, a new database of printed Arabic text is
   introduced. The new concept of collecting sub-words (PAWs) instead of
   words or individual character samples was adopted. These PAWs constitute
   all words in the Arabic language. The collected database consists of
   83,056 images of PAWs extracted from approximately 550,000 different
   words. Each sample is presented in the database in five font types:
   Thuluth, Naskh, Andalusi, Typing Machine, and Kufi. In total, the
   database consists of 415,280 images. Moreover, ground truth information
   is included with each PAW image to describe its occurrence number,
   occurrence frequency, positions and the shapes of the characters. This
   paper presents a statistical analysis of the frequency of each PAW in

Abstract = {{It has been shown that the space of possible minds is vast, actually

   questions in this field is the following: ``Which activities can minds
   perform during their lifetime?{''} This question is very broad, thus our
   contribution here addresses the sub-question ``Which non-boring
   activities can minds perform?{''} This issue is ethically relevant for
   human minds if the predicted significant extension of our lifetime
   materializes and we are then potentially challenged how to spend this
   additional time. The space of potential non-boring activities has been
   called ``fun space.{''} We analyze the relation between various types of
   minds and the portion of the fun space, which is accessible for them. As
   a novel result, we demonstrate that human minds can experience two types
   of fun when transforming information to knowledge: novelty fun and
   process fun.}},

Abstract = {{The use of distributed multi-agent systems (MAS) have increased in
   recent years, with the growing potential to handle large volumes of data
   and coordinate the operations of many organizations. In these systems,
   each agent independently handles a set of specialized tasks and
   cooperates to achieve the goals of the system and a high degree of
   flexibility. Multi-agent systems have become the most effective and
   widely used form of developing this type of application in which
   communication among various devices must be both reliable and efficient.
   One of the problems related to distribute computing is message passing,
   which is related to the interaction and coordination among intelligent
   agents. Consequently, a multi-agent architecture must necessarily
   provide a robust communication platform and control mechanisms. This
   paper presents the integration of an event-tracing model in an agent
   platform called PANGEA. Adding this new capability, the platform allows
   improving the monitoring and analysis of the information that agents can
   send/receive in order to fulfil their goals more efficiently.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new method for constructing a visibility graph in
   3D space. We use a method for predicting porosity of hardened specimens.
   We also use an intelligent system method to predict porosity of hardened
   specimens. Visibility graphs have many applications, one of which is the
   analysis of trend lines of market graphs. It is possible to use 2D
   visibility graphs for such analysis and the construction for 2D
   visibility graphs is well known; however, in this paper, we will present
   a new method for the construction of 3D visibility graphs. 3D visibility
   computations are central to any computer graphics application. Drawing
   graphs as nodes connected by links in 3D space is visually compelling
   but computationally difficult. Thus, the construction of 3D visibility
   graphs is highly complex and requires professional computers or
   supercomputers. This article describes a new method for analysing 3D
   visibility graphs. We develop new method for draws 3D visibility graphs
   for analysing microstructure pictures of robot laser-hardened specimens.
   The microstructure of robot laser-hardened specimens is very complex;
   however, we can present it using 3D visibility graphs. New method for
   the construction of 3D visibility graphs is very useful in many cases,
   including: illumination and rendering, motion planning, pattern
   recognition, computer graphics, computational geometry and sensor
   networks and the military and automotive industries. We use this new
   algorithm for determination complexity of porosity of the microstructure
   of robot laser-hardened specimens. For predicting surface porosity of
   hardened specimens we use neural network, genetic algorithm and multiple
   regression. With intelligent system we increase production of process of
   laser hardening, because we decrease time of process and increase
   topographical property of materials. Hybrid evolutionary computation is
   a generic, flexible, robust, and versatile method for solving complex
   global optimization problems and can also be used in practical
   applications. This paper explores the use of an intelligent system with
   such a hybrid method to improve existing hybrids. It describes a new
   hybrid method based on the cycle integration method.}},

Abstract = {{Characterising tractable fragments of the constraint satisfaction
   problem (CSP) is an important challenge in theoretical computer science
   and artificial intelligence. Forbidding patterns (generic sub-instances)
   provides a means of defining CSP fragments which are neither exclusively
   language-based nor exclusively structure-based. It is known that the
   class of binary CSP instances in which the broken-triangle pattern (BTP)
   does not occur, a class which includes all tree-structured instances,
   are decided by arc consistency (AC), a ubiquitous reduction operation in
   constraint solvers. We provide a characterisation of simple
   partially-ordered forbidden patterns which have this AC-solvability
   property. It turns out that BTP is just one of five such AC-solvable
   patterns. The four other patterns allow us to exhibit new tractable
   classes.}},

Abstract = {{Graph-search algorithms belong to the set of basic problem-solving
   algorithms in Artificial Intelligence. There are systematic graphs
   search algorithms and also heuristic ones. Depending on the aim, e.g.,
   to find any solution, all solutions, the best solution, one can choose
   an appropriate algorithm. The best-first algorithm is apt to find the
   best solution if a good heuristic is provided. Even, the obtained
   solution itself is the cheapest one, the way to obtain it may contain
   several useless branches. In this paper, a modified approach is shown
   which finds a solution having the minimal number of useless branches
   (depending also on the used heuristic). For the new algorithm, called
   minimum total cost search, the concept of the heuristic function is also
   changed: instead of predicting the cost of the closest goal state a kind
   of directed heuristic function is used: providing an estimation to the
   closest goal state from the given state to the given direction.}},

Abstract = {{The rise and development of the Internet of Things (IoT) have given
   birth to the frontier technology of the agricultural IoT, which marks
   the future trend in agriculture and the IoT. The agricultural IoT can be
   combined with Zigbee, a short-range wireless network technology for
   monitoring systems, to solve the excessively large planting area and
   other defects in agricultural production. Meanwhile, the modernization
   of planting and harvesting has set the stage for deep learning. Unlike
   the artificial neural network, the deep learning is an important
   intelligent algorithm, capable of solving many real-world problems.
   Therefore, this paper probes into the problems of modern automatic
   agriculture. First, the routing allocation technology and transmission
   mode were optimized to solve the energy consumption problem. Second, the
   classification model based on deep learning algorithm was put forward
   according to the application of the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) in
   continuous monitoring of soil temperature and humidity. Despite the lack
   of upper soil humidity sensor in agriculture, the model can still
   classify the soil moisture of the nodes, and derive the main soil
   moisture content. Finally, a solution was presented based on
   agricultural ZigBee WSN technology. In addition to cheap cost and low
   power consumption, the solution has the functions of reminding and
   recognition due to the adoption of artificial intelligence algorithm.
   Suffice it to say that the solution is a successful attempt to integrate
   artificial intelligence and sensor technology into agricultural
   modernization.}},

Journal = {{ACTA POLYTECHNICA HUNGARICA}},

Abstract = {{A bot is one of the main elements of all computer video games,
   frequently used for the creation of various opponent characters within a
   game. Opponent modeling is the problem of predicting the agent actions
   in a gaming environment. This paper proposes and describes the
   implementation of a bot as a personal opponent in a small educational
   game. In order to increase the efficiency when using such a small
   educational application/module, artificial intelligence was added in the
   form of a bot competing with the students. Pedagogical elements of the
   intelligent learning system are introduced through the pedagogical model
   and the student model. This paper demonstrates the use of the student
   model to present the player model built by the experience of a human
   teacher, with true/false questions incorporated with the bot strategy
   into the opponent model. The authors use the Monte Carlo approach in
   this implementation, known as artificial intelligence technique and a
   best-first search method used in most video games, but to the best of
   their knowledge, it has not been used for prediction in educational
   games based on bot strategy. The results highlight that the Monte Carlo
   approach presented via the BFTree classifier provides the best
   classification accuracy compared with other predictive models based on
   data mining classifiers. It was shown that the training data from the
   human player can help in creating a bot strategy for a personalized
   game-based learning system. The Help option can be used for the
   assessment of the students' current knowledge by counting the number of
   Help option accesses, the player relies on Help as a `source of
   knowledge' needed to complete the game task successfully. The obtained
   results show that the bot (personal opponent) stimulated players to
   replay the game multiple times, which may contribute to the increase of
   the students' knowledge.}},

   The paper addresses a main question for researchers and practitioners:
   Having data and a problem in hand, which method would be most suitable
   to create a model from the data and to efficiently solve the problem? In
   order to answer this question, the paper reviews the main features of
   the most popular neural network methods and then lists examples of
   applications already published and referenced. The methods include:
   simple MLP; hybrid systems; neuro-fuzzy systems; deep neural networks;
   spiking neural networks; quantum inspired evolutionary computation
   methods for network parameter optimization; deep learning neural
   networks and brain-like deep learning machines. The paper covers both
   methods and their numerous applications for data modelling, predictive
   systems, data mining, pattern recognition, across application areas of:

Abstract = {{Social Spider Optimization (SSO) algorithm is a swarm intelligence
   optimization algorithm based on the mating behavior of social spiders.
   Numerical simulation results have shown that SSO outperformed some
   classical swarm intelligence algorithms such as Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm
   and so on. However, there are still some deficiencies about SSO
   algorithm, such as the poor balance between exploration and
   exploitation. To this end, an improved SSO algorithm named wDESSO is
   proposed for global optimization, which can balance exploration and
   exploitation effectively. Specifically, a weighting factor changing with
   iteration is introduced to control and adjust the search scope of SSO
   algorithm dynamically. After social-spiders have completed their search,
   a mutation operator is then suggested for jumping out of the potential
   local optimization, thus can further strengthen the ability of global
   search. The experimental results on a set of standard benchmark
   functions demonstrate the effectiveness of wDESSO in solving complex
   numerical optimization problems.}},

Abstract = {{A lattice-valued information system is an important model in the field

   investigates invariant characterizations of information structures in a
   lattice-valued information system under homomorphisms based on data
   compression. Information structures in a lattice-valued information
   system is first proposed by using set vectors. Then, dependence and
   independence between information structures in the same lattice-valued
   information system is characterized by the inclusion degree. Finally, a
   complex massive lattice-valued information system can be compressed into
   a relatively small-scale lattice-valued information system by means of
   homomorphisms and it is proved that some characterizations of
   information structures in a lattice-valued information system under
   homomorphisms based on data compression are invariant, that is, some of

Abstract = {{The dissolved gas-in-oil analysis is a prevailing methodology being
   extensively utilized to diagnose incipient faults in oil-immersed power
   transformers. However distinct approaches have been implemented to find
   out dissolved gas analysis (DGA) results, they may sometimes fail to
   diagnose precisely. The incipient fault identification accuracy of
   various artificial intelligence (AI)-based methodology is assorted with
   change of input parameters. Thus, selection of input variable to an AI
   model is major research area. In this paper, principle component
   analysis algorithm using Rapid-Miner is applied to 360 experimental
   datasets, imitated in lab to identify most pertinent input variables for
   incipient fault classification. Thereafter, multi-class Extreme Learning
   Machine (ELM) technique is implemented to classify the incipient faults
   of power transformer and its performance is compared with artificial
   neural network, gene expression programming, fuzzy-logic, and support
   vector machine. The compared result shows that ELM provides better
   diagnosis results up to 100\% accuracy at proposed input variable in

Abstract = {{Currently, the network traffic control systems are mainly composed of
   the Internet core and wired/wireless heterogeneous backbone networks.
   Recently, these packet-switched systems are experiencing an explosive
   network traffic growth due to the rapid development of communication
   technologies. The existing network policies are not sophisticated enough
   to cope with the continually varying network conditions arising from the
   tremendous traffic growth. Deep learning, with the recent breakthrough
   in the machine learning/intelligence area, appears to be a viable
   approach for the network operators to configure and manage their
   networks in a more intelligent and autonomous fashion. While deep
   learning has received a significant research attention in a number of
   other domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, robotics, and
   so forth, its applications in network traffic control systems are
   relatively recent and garnered rather little attention. In this paper,
   we address this point and indicate the necessity of surveying the
   scattered works on deep learning applications for various network
   traffic control aspects. In this vein, we provide an overview of the
   state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and algorithms relevant to
   the network traffic control systems. Also, we discuss the deep learning
   enablers for network systems. In addition, we discuss, in detail, a new
   use case, i.e., deep learning based intelligent routing. We demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the deep learning-based routing approach in
   contrast with the conventional routing strategy. Furthermore, we discuss
   a number of open research issues, which researchers may find useful in
   the future.}},

Title = {{APRICOIN: An Adaptive Approach for Prioritizing High-Risk Containers
   Inspections}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{18238-18249}},
Abstract = {{Risk evaluation of the containers remains a difficult task, often due to
   incomplete or ambiguous information on containers. In addition, the
   evaluation process needs to be adapted on an ongoing basis to cope with
   emerging risk factors. Furthermore, high-risk container inspection is
   commonly hindered by a low inspection capacity, which leads to a major
   issue: how can we prioritize the container inspection if the number of
   suspect containers exceeds the inspection capacity? Container inspection
   prioritizing may be the answer. In this paper, we propose a novel
   approach for adaptively prioritizing container inspection (APRICOIN).
   First, we enhance the container information flow to alleviate the
   problem of incomplete information by proposing an enhanced container
   descriptive. Second, we introduce the APRICOIN algorithm, which combines
   frequent pattern mining and a fuzzy logic system, to assess the
   container's risk score. The frequent pattern growth algorithm is
   proposed to retrieve the key criteria for evaluating container risk.
   This is done through mining frequent criteria sets within the historic
   data set of container inspections by customs. The mined frequent
   criteria sets are used to assess fuzzy inference rules which are
   periodically readjusted to integrate new key criteria. Thereafter, the
   fuzzy logic system uses the obtained fuzzy inference rules to calculate
   a container's risk score. Our major contribution consists of providing a
   new adaptive approach for assessing a container's risk through combining
   frequent criteria mining and fuzzy logic. An illustrative study and a
   comparison with alternative approaches are performed to validate the
   proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Many endogenous and external components may affect the physiological,
   mental and behavioral states in humans. Monitoring tools are required to
   evaluate biomarkers, identify biological events, and predict their
   outcomes. Being one of the valuable indicators, brain biomarkers derived
   from temporal or spectral electroencephalography (EEG) signals
   processing, allow for the classification of mental disorders and mental
   tasks. An EEG signal has a non-stationary nature and individual
   frequency feature, hence it can be concluded that each subject has
   peculiar timing and data to extract unique features. In order to
   classify data, which are collected by performing four mental task
   (reciting the alphabet backwards, imagination of rotation of a cube,
   imagination of right hand movements (open/close) and performing
   mathematical operations), discriminative features were extracted using
   four competitive time-frequency techniques; Wavelet Packet Decomposition
   (WPD), Morlet Wavelet Transform (MWT), Short Time Fourier Transform
   (STFT) and Wavelet Filter Bank (WFB), respectively. The extracted
   features using both time and frequency domain information were then
   reduced using a principal component analysis for subset reduction.
   Finally, the reduced subsets were fed into a multi-layer perceptron
   neural network (MP-NN) trained with back propagation (BP) algorithm to
   generate a predictive model. This study mainly focuses on comparing the
   relative performance of time-frequency feature extraction methods that
   are used to classify mental tasks. The real-time (RT) conducted
   experimental results underlined that the WPD feature extraction method
   outperforms with 92\% classification accuracy compared to three other
   aforementioned methods for four different mental tasks.}},

   variations among subtests indicate potential areas of improvement. In
   particular, results were strongest for the Vocabulary and Similarities
   subtests, intermediate for the Information subtest and lowest for the
   Comprehension and Word Reasoning subtests. Comprehension is the subtest
   most strongly associated with common sense. The large variations among
   subtests and ordinary common sense strongly suggest that the WPPSI-III
   VIQ results do not show that ConceptNet has the verbal abilities of a
   four-year-old. Rather, children's IQ tests offer one objective metric
   for the evaluation and comparison of AI systems. Also, this work
   continues previous research on psychometric AI.}},

   Algorithmand Convolution Neural Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{23891-23900}},
Abstract = {{In the age of Industry 4.0, the techniques of artificial intelligence
   and pattern recognition play a critical role to develop the smart
   factories. In this paper, a block recognition system, named e-Block, was
   developed by using a novel projection algorithm and the convolution
   neural networks. The developed system displays a picture of the target
   object (e.g., a car or a house), and the children follow the
   instructions provided by the system and use the various blocks to build
   the object. Subsequently, this system compares the assembled block with
   the target object and determines whether the shape is identical. To
   identify the assembled block, this system applies Kinect to obtain
   information on the depth of the object and a new projection algorithm is
   proposed for converting the depth information into three feature images.
   By integrating three feature images, the convolution neural networks
   (CNN) are employed to construct the classifier to identify the assembled
   block. In the experiments conducted in this paper, the CNN classifier
   was compared with three classification algorithms. The experimental
   results show that the CNN classifier can accurately recognizes whether
   the assembled object is identical to the target object and outperform
   the compared classification algorithms. In additions, the experimental
   results also reveal that the proposed recognition algorithm can be a
   useful technique for applying in various applications of Industry 4.0.}},

Abstract = {{Encryption has an important role in protecting cyber assets. However the
   use of weak encryption algorithms is a vulnerability that may be
   exploited. When exploited, detecting this vulnerability from encrypted
   data is a very difficult task to undertake. This research explores the
   use of recent advancement in machine learning algorithms specifically
   deep learning algorithms to classify encryption schemes based on entropy
   measurements of encrypted data with no feature engineering. Past
   research works using various machine learning algorithms have failed to
   achieve good accuracy results in classification. The research entails
   applying popular encryption algorithms with block cipher modes over the
   image dataset from CIFAR10. Two ImageNet winning convolutional neural
   network deep learning models were used to perform the classification.
   Transfer learning and layer modification were applied to evaluate the
   classification effectiveness. This research concludes that deep learning
   algorithms can be used to perform such classification where other
   algorithms have failed.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{7, SI}},
Pages = {{2358-2378}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Parameter identification is an important issue in structural
   health monitoring and damage identification for concrete dams. The
   purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel adaptive fireworks
   algorithm (AFWA) into inverse analysis of parameter identification.
   Design/methodology/approach - Swarm intelligence algorithms and finite
   element analysis are integrated to identify parameters of hydraulic
   structures. Three swarm intelligence algorithms: AFWA, standard particle
   swarm optimization (SPSO) and artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) are
   adopted to make a comparative study. These algorithms are introduced
   briefly and then tested by four standard benchmark functions. Inverse
   analysis methods based on AFWA, SPSO and ABC are adopted to identify
   Young's modulus of a concrete gravity dam and a concrete arch dam.
   Findings - Numerical results show that swarm intelligence algorithms are
   powerful tools for parameter identification of concrete structures. The
   proposed AFWA-based inverse analysis algorithm for concrete dams is
   promising in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
   Originality/value - Fireworks algorithm is applied for inverse analysis
   of hydraulic structures for the first time, and the problem of parameter
   selection in AFWA is studied.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, which has explicit strategies to
   balance intensification and diversification, is a simple and effective
   swarm intelligence algorithm for both continuous and combinatorial
   optimisation problems. Selection scheme, which is used by onlooker bees
   to select employed bees to follow, is an important factor for ABC
   algorithm to keep good balance between intensification and
   diversification. In this paper, a normalised fitness function for
   minimisation problem is first proposed for roulette wheel selection, so
   ABC can still have enough selection pressure in late stage. And then,
   aim to analyse the effect of different selection schemes, systematic
   experiments were carried for roulette wheel selection, rank selection,
   tournament selection, and disruptive selection on a set of test
   functions with different dimensions and different computation resources.
   Simulation results show that the suitability of a selection scheme
   depends not only on the features of test functions and but also on the
   computation resources used. No selection scheme can always outperform
   other selection schemes on all test functions.}},

Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{20036-20045}},
Abstract = {{Owing to many appealing properties, neural networks provide a natural
   basis for solving different kinds of problems. The performance of neural
   networks greatly depends on whether they can provide appealing solutions
   to the problems of the parameter learning (i.e., the connecting weights
   in each layer) and the structure learning (i.e., the network structure).
   These two kinds of learning can be performed simultaneously or
   separately. In this paper, we proposed the Jacobian matrix-based
   learning machine (JMLM) to provide an appealing solution to the
   aforementioned two kinds of learning. The network structure of a JMLM
   can be incrementally constructed and a Jacobian-matrix-based learning
   method is proposed to efficiently estimate the corresponding network
   parameters. Furthermore, we can provide physically meaningful
   explanations to help human analyzers to make decisions based on the
   parameters embedded in a trained JMLM. One 2-D artificial data set, one
   benchmark medical data set, and an intensive care unit survival
   prediction data set were used for demonstrating the performance of the
   proposed JMLM.}},

Abstract = {{With the developments and applications of the new information
   technologies, such as cloud computing, Internet of Things, big data, and
   artificial intelligence, a smart manufacturing era is coming. At the
   same time, various national manufacturing development strategies have
   been put forward, such as Industry 4.0, Industrial Internet,
   manufacturing based on Cyber-Physical System, and Made in China 2025.
   However, one of specific challenges to achieve smart manufacturing with
   these strategies is how to converge the manufacturing physical world and
   the virtual world, so as to realize a series of smart operations in the
   manufacturing process, including smart interconnection, smart
   interaction, smart control and management, etc. In this context, as a
   basic unit of manufacturing, shop-floor is required to reach the
   interaction and convergence between physical and virtual spaces, which
   is not only the imperative demand of smart manufacturing, but also the
   evolving trend of itself. Accordingly, a novel concept of digital twin
   shop-floor (DTS) based on digital twin is explored and its four key
   components are discussed, including physical shop-floor, virtual
   shop-floor, shop-floor service system, and shop-floor digital twin data.
   What is more, the operation mechanisms and implementing methods for DTS
   are studied and key technologies as well as challenges ahead are
   investigated, respectively.}},

   argumentation in AI, with semantics defining sets of jointly acceptable
   arguments, i.e., extensions. Understanding the dynamics of AFs has been
   recently recognized as an important topic in the study of argumentation
   in AI. In this work, we focus on the so-called extension enforcement
   problem in abstract argumentation as a recently proposed form of
   argumentation dynamics. We provide a nearly complete computational
   complexity map of argument-fixed extension enforcement under various
   major AF semantics, with results ranging from polynomial-time algorithms
   to completeness for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.
   Complementing the complexity results, we propose algorithms for NP-hard
   extension enforcement based on constraint optimization under the maximum
   satisfiability (MaxSAT) paradigm. Going beyond NP, we propose novel
   MaxSAT-based counterexample-guided abstraction refinement procedures for
   the second-level complete problems and present empirical results on a
   prototype system constituting the first approach to extension
   enforcement in its generality.}},

Title = {{Rationalisation of Profiles of Abstract Argumentation Frameworks:
   Characterisation and Complexity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{149-177}},
Abstract = {{Different agents may have different points of view. Following a popular
   approach in the artificial intelligence literature, this can be modelled
   by means of different abstract argumentation frameworks, each consisting
   of a set of arguments the agent is contemplating and a binary
   attack-relation between them. A question arising in this context is
   whether the diversity of views observed in such a profile of
   argumentation frameworks is consistent with the assumption that every
   individual argumentation framework is induced by a combination of,
   first, some basic factual attack-relation between the arguments and,
   second, the personal preferences of the agent concerned regarding the
   moral or social values the arguments under scrutiny relate to. We treat
   this question of rationalisability of a profile as an algorithmic
   problem and identify tractable and intractable cases. In doing so, we
   distinguish different constraints on admissible rationalisations, e.g.,
   concerning the types of preferences used or the number of distinct
   values involved. We also distinguish two different semantics for
   rationalisability, which differ in the assumptions made on how agents
   treat attacks between arguments they do not report. This research
   agenda, bringing together ideas from abstract argumentation and social
   choice, is useful for understanding what types of profiles can
   reasonably be expected to occur in a multiagent system.}},

Abstract = {{One candidate approach to creating artificial general intelligence (AGI)

   such reasoning, we offer some initial ideas to make neuromorphic AGI

Abstract = {{With the progress in science and technology, many types of electrical
   equipment have been invented, making the use of electricity more
   extensive, and living environment more comfortable. However, in modern
   times, every country stresses the need to promote green energy in order
   to reduce environmental damage, while the Taiwanese government made an
   attempt to adjust electricity price as a means to make Taiwan people to
   reduce carbon emissions and pollution on the planet. Therefore, the
   paper takes electricity price on the power consumption of Taiwan people
   as the research object, observes tariff adjustment trends of relevant
   government departments, and builds Taiwan's average electricity
   consumption and the average price forecast model to provide references
   to government and researchers. Firstly, we gather data of electricity
   consumption and price from Taiwan Power Company's website, and draw a
   trend chart to explore the relationship between the two; and
   respectively work out technical indicators of average electric quantity
   and electricity prices by referring to stock technical indicators;
   finally, we compare Neural Network parameters optimized by Grey Fruit
   Fly Optimization Algorithm (GFOA) to build average power consumption and
   average electricity price forecasting models, and compare the best
   prediction model with other three algorithms. The study results
   demonstrate that the electricity consumption and electricity price
   trends have different characteristics; it is found out that the
   prediction model of smoothing parameter sigma of General Regression
   Neural Network optimized by GFOA has better predictive ability compared
   to prediction models constructed by other three algorithms.}},

Title = {{A Multicriteria Intelligence Aid Methodology Using MCDA, Artificial
   Intelligence, and Fuzzy Sets Theory}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Intelligence is increasingly relevant today in both military and
   business intelligence contexts. Business executives, military, and
   governments have more large datasets and meet difficulties in
   anticipating threat/competitor future decisions. Decision anticipation
   is desirable because it will enhance situation understanding and then
   will limit the surprise effect and favor more appropriate reactions and
   decision-making. Generating and evaluating competitor/threat actions is
   a very challenging problem because of the uncertainty, incompleteness,
   and ambiguity associated with it. This paper extends the multicriteria
   decision aid (MCDA) methodology to the context of intelligence analysis
   and proposes the main pillars of a novel methodology called
   ``Multicriteria Intelligence Aid{''} (MCIA). More specifically, this
   paper addresses how can we adapt MCDA to the context of intelligence
   analysis and how can we use existent methods and techniques from MCDA,
   artificial intelligence, and fuzzy sets theory to build this
   methodology. The paper presents the MCIA steps, which consist of (i)
   structuring the competitor/threat decision problem, (ii) handling
   imperfect data, (iii) modeling the analyst's risk attitude, and (iv)
   aggregating the performance of the generated potential actions. An
   illustration of the methodology is provided in the military context.
   Results show that the novel methodology is applicable and provides
   interesting and valuable results.}},

Journal = {{WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{During the last few years, several approaches have been proposed to
   improve early warning systems for managing geological risk due to
   landslides, where important infrastructures (such as railways, highways,
   pipelines, and aqueducts) are exposed elements. In this regard, an
   Artificial intelligence Camera Prototype (AiCP) for real-time monitoring
   has been integrated in a multisensor monitoring system devoted to rock
   fall detection. An abandoned limestone quarry was chosen at Acuto
   (central Italy) as test-site for verifying the reliability of the
   integrated monitoring system. A portion of jointed rock mass, with
   dimensions suitable for optical monitoring, was instrumented by
   extensometers. One meter of railway track was used as a target for
   fallen blocks and a weather station was installed nearby. Main goals of
   the test were (i) evaluating the reliability of the AiCP and (ii)
   detecting rock blocks that reach the railway track by the AiCP. At this
   aim, several experiments were carried out by throwing rock blocks over
   the railway track. During these experiments, the AiCP detected the
   blocks and automatically transmitted an alarm signal.}},

Abstract = {{ABC is a well-known nature inspired algorithm. In short ABC algorithm
   mimics the foraging behavior of the bee colonies. ABC is very
   intensively worked algorithm. It has many variants. The base algorithm
   and most of the variants uses an update equation to improve the
   solutions. The update equation finds a feasible movement based on
   neighbor solutions and adds that movement to current to create a mutant
   solution. If the mutant solution is better than the original one then
   original solution is updated. None of the ABC variant use a successful
   movement again. In this work when a successful move found then it is
   used again. Proposed approach is applied to ABCVSS algorithm which is a
   recently proposed ABC variant and that modified ABCVSS algorithm
   (ABCVSSRSM) is tested on numerical benchmark functions and results
   compared the well-known ABC variants. Results show that proposed method
   is superior under multiple criteria.}},

Title = {{Consensus of Teleoperating Cyber-Physical System via Centralized and
   Decentralized Controllers}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{17271-17287}},
Abstract = {{Teleoperating cyber-physical system (TCPS) has been considered as a
   promising technology to stretch artificial intelligences to remote
   locations. Many applications of TCPS demand operator and slaves to keep
   state consensus on the shared information. However, the cyber- and
   physical-constrained characteristics on TCPS make it difficult to
   realize such a consensus. This paper investigates the consensus problem
   for single-master-multi-slave TCPS with time-varying delay and actuator
   saturation. According to the communication structures of slaves,
   centralized and decentralized controllers are, respectively, designed to
   drive the consensus of master and slave robots. To simplify the
   information fusion in decentralized controller design, we use
   min-weighted rigid graph-based topology optimization algorithm to reduce
   the communication redundancy in slave site. Under time-varying delay and
   actuator saturation constraints, the sufficient stability conditions are
   presented to show that the centralized and decentralized controllers can
   stabilize the single-master-multi-slave TCPS. Moreover, the stability
   conditions are rearranged into a form of linear matrix inequalities, and
   then, the required initial stability conditions for master and slaves
   are developed. Finally, simulations and experiments are demonstrated to
   show the validity of the method. It is shown that the consensus
   controllers can guarantee the asymptotic stability of
   single-master-multi-slave TCPS, while the topology optimization can
   reduce the redundancy of communication links.}},

Title = {{Complexity of n-Queens Completion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{815-848}},
Abstract = {{The n-Queens problem is to place n chess queens on an n by n chessboard
   so that no two queens are on the same row, column or diagonal. The
   n-Queens Completion problem is a variant, dating to 1850, in which some
   queens are already placed and the solver is asked to place the rest, if
   possible. We show that n-Queens Completion is both NP-Complete and
   \#P-Complete. A corollary is that any non-attacking arrangement of
   queens can be included as a part of a solution to a larger n-Queens
   problem. We introduce generators of random instances for n-Queens
   Completion and the closely related Blocked n-Queens and Excluded
   Diagonals Problem. We describe three solvers for these problems, and
   empirically analyse the hardness of randomly generated instances. For
   Blocked n-Queens and the Excluded Diagonals Problem, we show the
   existence of a phase transition associated with hard instances as has
   been seen in other NP-Complete problems, but a natural generator for
   n-Queens Completion did not generate consistently hard instances. The
   significance of this work is that the n-Queens problem has been very
   widely used as a benchmark in Artificial Intelligence, but conclusions
   on it are often disputable because of the simple complexity of the
   decision problem. Our results give alternative benchmarks which are hard
   theoretically and empirically, but for which solving techniques designed
   for n-Queens need minimal or no change.}},

Abstract = {{Over 93 million people get ill with sexually transmitted diseases in

   sexually transmitted diseases (ESSTD) that maintains the anonymity of
   the individuals. The patients diagnose themselves by answering questions
   provided by the system. This paper presents the design and development
   of the system. Forward chaining rules were used to implement the
   knowledge base and the system is easily accessible on mobile platforms.
   The Java Expert System Shell was used for its inference engine and the
   system was validated by domain experts. It is useful because it helps to
   maintain anonymity for patients with STD.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{99-108}},
Abstract = {{The simplicity and robustness of the artificial bee colony (ABC)
   algorithm has attracted the attention of optimisation researchers.
   Although ABC has fewer tuned parameters, making it an easy-to-use tool,
   it has shown better performance than other prominent optimisation
   algorithms such as differential evolution (DE), evolutionary algorithms
   (EA) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithms at solving
   optimisation problems. Despite these advantages, researchers have found
   that the standard ABC actually suffers from slow convergence speed on
   unimodal functions and is often trapped in local minima of multimodal
   functions. Most problematically, it does not balance the exploitation
   and exploration stages, leading to various inefficiencies in terms of
   capability. This paper presents a new ABC variant referred to as
   JA-ABC4b, which has been formulated to balance exploitation and
   exploration in order to boost optimisation performance. JA-ABC4b has
   been experimentally tested on 27 benchmark functions and economic
   environmental dispatch (EED) problems. The results have revealed a
   robust performance of JA-ABC4b in comparison to other existing ABC
   variants and other optimisation algorithms.}},

   meta-heuristics for controlling the number of pheromones created in the

Abstract = {{The text describes the optimization task of renewable energy sources
   distributed to electrical microgrid of fictitious intelligent area that

   Testing was performed on the analytical functions but those will be only
   covered marginally. Of the tests on the approximation functions the
   method of simulated annealing would be the most suitable algorithm for
   the optimization task. Furthermore, two experiments were introduced. The
   first lies in the application of cluster analysis on daily diagrams of
   electricity consumption in intelligent buildings. Because the modeled
   year history of hourly electricity consumption is represented by
   multidimensional data this data forms the training set during the
   adaptive dynamics submitted to a competence model of neural network by
   days. After the network adaptation process the Kohonen's map during the
   adaptive dynamics will be drawn, from which required clusters can be
   read. In the second experiment a sorting design of the resources for
   typical days of a week is performed in the computer program UniCon.}},

   provides a survey of current computational models of emotion and their
   applications in engineering. Finally, it assesses potential of
   integrating emotions in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) by listing some

Abstract = {{In this paper the results of using a Multi-agent system (MAS) for
   Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) are detailed. A study between
   different MAS architectures reported in literature is presented in order
   to select and adapt the most adequate one for SHM tasks. Requirements
   are established according to recent solutions, where main parameters are
   type and number of sensors and communication protocols, among others.
   MAS technique uses several intelligent agents, that are algorithms able
   to act in a reactive or active way. Their action depends on surrounding
   environment or collected data. These agents can work in a decentralized
   way, searching the fulfillment of an individual goal or they can work
   with another system to achieve a common goal. Decision is based on their
   internal state (beliefs, goals and commitments). MAS' effectiveness
   depends on the interconnection between the agents. Type of agents is
   defined according to its communication method and protocol, common and
   individual goals, among others. Decentralization and versatility are two
   important characteristics of MAS technique useful to solve SHM problem.
   This is one of the main motivations to consider this technique to be a
   good approach for the studied problem. A benchmark numerical model,
   which consists of a metallic framework, was used to validate and
   demonstrate the feasibility of the selected architecture for SHM.}},

Title = {{Generalized support and formal development of constraint propagators}},
Journal = {{AI COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{325-346}},
Abstract = {{Constraint programming is a family of techniques for solving
   combinatorial problems, where the problem is modelled as a set of
   decision variables (typically with finite domains) and a set of
   constraints that express relations among the decision variables. One key
   concept in constraint programming is propagation: reasoning on a
   constraint or set of constraints to derive new facts, typically to
   remove values from the domains of decision variables. Specialized
   propagation algorithms (propagators) exist for many classes of
   constraints.
   The concept of support is pervasive in the design of propagators.
   Traditionally, when a domain value ceases to have support, it may be
   removed because it takes part in no solutions. Arc-consistency
   algorithms such as AC2001 {[}in: Proceedings 17th International Joint
   Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2001), 2001, pp. 309-315]
   make use of support in the form of a single domain value. GAC algorithms
   such as GAC-Schema {[}in: Proceedings 15th International Joint
   Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 97), 1997, pp. 398-404] use
   a tuple of values to support each literal. We generalize these notions
   of support in two ways. First, we allow a set of tuples to act as
   support. Second, the supported object is generalized from a set of
   literals (GAC-Schema) to an entire constraint or any part of it.
   We design a methodology for developing correct propagators using
   generalized support. A constraint is expressed as a family of support
   properties, which may be proven correct against the formal semantics of
   the constraint. We show how to derive correct propagators from the
   constructive proofs of the support properties. The framework is
   carefully designed to allow efficient algorithms to be produced. Derived
   algorithms may make use of dynamic literal triggers or watched literals
   {[}in: Proc. 12th International Conference on the Principles and
   Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2006), 2006, pp. 182-197] for
   efficiency. Finally, three case studies of deriving efficient algorithms
   are given.}},

Abstract = {{Unphotographic images are the powerful representations described various

   features relating to continuous scene etc., was pursued. Especially, the
   length network and each scene of four-scene comics are limited so as to
   ensure a clear interpretation of the contents. In this study, as the
   first step in this direction, the problem to classify two four-scene
   comics by the same artists were focused as the example. Several
   classifiers were constructed by utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network

   Biological Information for Yeast Protein Interaction Network}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{15893-15900}},
Abstract = {{With the development of high -throughput interaction detection
   techniques such as tandem affinity purification (TAP) and yeast
   two-hybrid (Y2H), the available genome-wide protein protein interactions
   (PPIs) data have been increasing in recent years. Using mathematical,
   physical, and artificial intelligence methods, some researchers in
   computational biology focused on uncovering the evolutionary ages of
   proteins according to present PPI networks (PINs), but improving their
   accuracy was challenging. A plausible explanation is that they solved
   biological problems with non-biological techniques and did not provide
   much attention to biological backgrounds and meanings of proteins or
   their relationships. In this paper, we propose two ways to improve the
   accuracy of age predicting and skillfully ``embedding{''} multi source
   biological information in each iteration of an archaeology algorithm for
   yeast PIN. On the one hand, we reduce the probability of reversing
   errors by decreasing the non-duplication protein pairs, which are
   obtained from 460 gene trees constructed by means of a multiple sequence
   alignment and the neighbor joining algorithm. On the other hand, the
   reliable crossover standard from different biological information
   sources can decrease local random errors of alternative treatment. The
   application of the novel algorithm to simulation data and real yeast
   PINs shows a marked improvement in accuracy. Our research strongly
   suggests that putting non-biological methods into the ``biological
   context{''} will bear more favorable results.}},

Abstract = {{The adaptive educational systems within e-learning platforms are built
   in response to the fact that the learning process is different for each
   and every learner. In order to provide adaptive e-learning services and
   study materials that are tailor-made for adaptive learning, this type of
   educational approach seeks to combine the ability to comprehend and
   detect a person's specific needs in the context of learning with the
   expertise required to use appropriate learning pedagogy and enhance the
   learning process. Thus, it is critical to create accurate student
   profiles and models based upon analysis of their affective states,
   knowledge level, and their individual personality traits and skills. The
   acquired data can then be efficiently used and exploited to develop an
   adaptive learning environment. Once acquired, these learner models can
   be used in two ways. The first is to inform the pedagogy proposed by the
   experts and designers of the adaptive educational system. The second is
   to give the system dynamic self-learning capabilities from the behaviors
   exhibited by the teachers and students to create the appropriate
   pedagogy and automatically adjust the e-learning environments to suit
   the pedagogies. In this respect, artificial intelligence techniques may
   be useful for several reasons, including their ability to develop and
   imitate human reasoning and decision-making processes (learning-teaching
   model) and minimize the sources of uncertainty to achieve an effective
   learning-teaching context. These learning capabilities ensure both
   learner and system improvement over the lifelong learning mechanism. In
   this paper, we present a survey of raised and related topics to the
   field of artificial intelligence techniques employed for adaptive
   educational systems within e-learning, their advantages and
   disadvantages, and a discussion of the importance of using those
   techniques to achieve more intelligent and adaptive e-learning
   environments.}},

Title = {{Mobile Ad Hoc Network Energy Cost Algorithm Based on Artificial Bee
   Colony}},
Journal = {{WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes that
   dynamically form a temporary network without using any existing network
   infrastructure. MANET selects a path with minimal number of intermediate
   nodes to reach the destination node. As the distance between each node
   increases, the quantity of transmission power increases. The power level
   of nodes affects the simplicity with which a route is constituted
   between a couple of nodes. This study utilizes the swarm intelligence
   technique through the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to optimize
   the energy consumption in a dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol in
   MANET. The proposed algorithm is called bee DSR (BEEDSR). The ABC
   algorithm is used to identify the optimal path from the source to the
   destination to overcome energy problems. The performance of the BEEDSR
   algorithm is compared with DSR and bee-inspired protocols (BeeIP). The
   comparison was conducted based on average energy consumption, average
   throughput, average end-to-end delay, routing overhead, and packet
   delivery ratio performance metrics, varying the node speed and packet
   size. The BEEDSR algorithm is superior in performance than other
   protocols in terms of energy conservation and delay degradation relating
   to node speed and packet size.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - In view of the elderly caregiving service being in high demand
   nowadays, the purpose of this paper is to develop an intelligent
   e-healthcare system for the domestic care industry by using the Internet
   of Things (IoTs) and Fuzzy Association Rule Mining (FARM) approach.
   Design/methodology/approach - The IoTs connected with the e-healthcare
   system collect real-time vital sign monitoring data for the e-healthcare
   system. The FARM approach helps to identify the hidden relationships
   between the data records in the e-healthcare systemto support the
   elderly care management tasks.
   Findings -To evaluate the proposed system and approach, a case study was
   carried out to identify the association between the specific collected
   demographic data, behavior data and the health measurements data in the
   e-healthcare system. It is found that the discovered rules are useful
   for the care management tasks in the elderly healthcare service.
   Originality/value - Knowledge discovery in databases uses various data
   mining techniques and rule-based artificial intelligence algorithms.
   This paper demonstrates complete processes on how an e-healthcare system
   connected with IoTs can support the elderly care services via a data
   collection phase, data analysis phase and data reporting phase by using
   the FARM to evaluate the fuzzy sets of the data attributes. The
   caregivers can use the discovered rules for proactive decision support
   of healthcare services and to improve the overall service quality by
   enhancing the elderly healthcare service responsiveness.}},

Title = {{Detecting sarcasm in customer tweets: an NLP based approach}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1109-1126}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study sarcasm in online text -
   specifically on twitter - to better understand customer opinions about
   social issues, products, services, etc. This can be immensely helpful in
   reducing incorrect classification of consumer sentiment toward issues,
   products and services.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this study, 5,000 tweets were
   downloaded and analyzed. Relevant features were extracted and supervised
   learning algorithms were applied to identify the best differentiating
   features between a sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentence.
   Findings - The results using two different classification algorithms,
   namely, Naive Bayes and maximum entropy show that function words and
   content words together are most effective in identifying sarcasm in
   tweets. The most differentiating features between a sarcastic and a
   non-sarcastic tweet were identified.
   Practical implications - Understanding the use of sarcasm in tweets let
   companies do better sentiment analysis and product recommendations for
   users. This could help businesses attract new customers and retain the
   old ones resulting in better customer management.
   Originality/value - This paper uses novel features to identify sarcasm
   in online text which is one of the most challenging problems in natural
   language processing. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study
   on sarcasm detection from a customer management perspective.}},

Pages = {{949-966}},
Abstract = {{Steganography is the science of secure communication where the presence
   of the communication cannot be detected while steganalysis is the art of
   discovering the existence of the secret communication. Processing a huge
   amount of information takes extensive execution time and computational
   sources most of the time. As a result, it is needed to employ a phase of
   preprocessing, which can moderate the execution time and computational
   sources. In this paper, we propose a new feature-based blind
   steganalysis method for detecting stego images from the cover (clean)
   images with JPEG format. In this regard, we present a feature selection
   technique based on an improved Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). ABC
   algorithm is inspired by honeybees' social behaviour in their search for
   perfect food sources. In the proposed method, classifier performance and
   the dimension of the selected feature vector depend on using
   wrapper-based methods. The experiments are performed using two large
   data-sets of JPEG images. Experimental results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed steganalysis technique compared to the
   other existing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Since its creation in 2005 by D. Karaboga the ABC algorithm proved to be
   very effective in approaching a wide variety of research optimization
   problems. However, some drawbacks were also experienced related mainly
   to a poor exploitation capability (which makes the algorithm relatively
   slow) and poor success rates when highly non-linear optimization
   problems with unstructured modes are approached. In order to improve the
   performance of the ABC algorithm, in both efficiency and success rate,
   the paper presents a set of proposed enhancements to the original ABC
   algorithm. The novel proposed ABC variant, Fast ABC (F - ABC), was
   tested against two known variants of ABC, the original algorithm
   proposed by D. Karaboga ({[}1]), and an improved variant, Gbest-guided
   Artificial Bee Colony (GABC) ({[}2]). The testing was conducted by
   employing an original testing methodology over a set of 11 scalable,
   multimodal, continuous optimization functions (10 unconstrained and 1
   constrained) with known global solutions. The novel F - ABC algorithm
   clearly outperformed the older variants in both efficiency and success
   rate over the test functions which present unstructured modes, while for
   the remaining test functions the results were mixed.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Golden Sine Algorithm (Gold-SA) is presented as a new
   metaheuristic method for solving optimization problems. Gold-SA has been
   developed as a new search algorithm based on population. This math-based
   algorithm is inspired by sine that is a trigonometric function. In the
   algorithm, random individuals are created as many as the number of
   search agents with uniform distribution for each dimension. The Gold-SA
   operator searches to achieve a better solution in each iteration by
   trying to bring the current situation closer to the target value. The
   solution space is narrowed by the golden section so that the areas that
   are supposed to give only good results are scanned instead of the whole
   solution space scan. In the tests performed, it is seen that Gold-SA has
   better results than other population based methods. In addition, Gold-SA
   has fewer algorithm-dependent parameters and operators than other
   metaheuristic methods, increasing the importance of this method by
   providing faster convergence of this new method.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{11490-11504}},
Abstract = {{Many studies of the mining of big learning data focus on user access
   patterns and video-viewing behaviors, while less attention is paid to
   the active video-viewing time. This paper pinpoints this completely
   different analysis unit, models the extent to which factors influence it
   and further predicts when a user permanently leaves a course. The goal
   is to provide new insights and tutorials regarding data analytics and
   feature subspace construction to learning analysts, researchers of
   artificial intelligence in education and data mining communities. To
   this end, we collect video-viewing data from a large-scale e-learning
   system and use the Cox proportional hazard function to model the leaving
   time. The models mainly include the interactions between variables,
   non-linearity assumption and age segmentation. Finally, we use the
   collected hazard ratios of model covariates as the learning features and
   predict which users tend to prematurely and permanently leave a course
   using efficient machine learning algorithms. The results show that,
   first the modeling can be used as an efficient feature extraction and
   selection technology for classification problems and that, second the
   prediction can effectively identify users' leaving time using only a few
   variables. Our method is efficient and useful for analyzing massive open

Abstract = {{Clustering is a popular data analysis technique to find the hidden
   relationship between patterns. It is an unsupervised technique which is
   applied to obtain the optimal cluster centres especially in
   partitioned-based clustering algorithms. Cat swarm optimisation (CSO) is
   a new meta-heuristic algorithm which has been applied to solve various
   optimisation problems and it provides better results in comparison to
   same class of algorithms. But, this algorithm suffers from diversity and
   local optima problems. This study presents a new hybrid CSO algorithm by
   incorporating Monte Carlo-based search equation and population centroid
   (PopC) operator with Gaussian probability distribution. Monte
   Carlo-based search equation is applied to enhance the diversity of the
   CSO algorithm. The population centroid (PopC) operator is used to
   prevent the CSO algorithm from trapping in local optima. The performance
   of the proposed algorithm is tested with several artificial and real
   datasets and compared with existing methods like K-means and PSO. The
   experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is a robust
   and effective algorithm to handle the clustering problems.}},

Abstract = {{In order for us to trust artificial intelligence systems, they need to
   be able to explain their decisions. This article investigates a
   case-based reasoning (CBR) approach for generating explanations where a
   new event is explained by combining and modifying explanations of
   multiple previous events. This approach is implemented in a CBR system
   for incident analysis where the goal is to identify causes of
   transportation incidents. The system generates explanations that connect
   the observed events to the root causes of the incident through
   intermediate states and events. Explanations for past incidents are
   automatically extracted from textual incident reports using natural
   language processing, thus avoiding the manual effort of constructing
   explanations. The system is evaluated on incident reports from the
   Transportation Safety Board of Canada, supporting the hypothesis that
   adapting explanations of multiple previous events rather than a single
   event results in a more comprehensive explanation of a new event.}},

Abstract = {{Human societies appear in many types of simulations. Particularly, a lot
   of new computer games contain a virtual world that imitates the real
   world. A few of the most important and the most difficult society
   elements to be modelled are the social context and individuals
   cooperation. In this paper we show how the social context and
   cooperation ability can be provided using agents that are equipped with
   internal visions of mutual social relations. Internal vision is a
   representation of social relations from the agent's point of view so,
   due to being subjective, it may be inconsistent with the reality. We
   introduce the agent model and the mechanism of rebuilding the agent's
   internal vision that is similar to that used by humans. An experimental
   proof of concept implementation is also presented.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{10422-10433}},
Abstract = {{Human behavior analysis has become a critical area of research in
   computer vision and artificial intelligence research community. In
   recent years, video surveillance systems of crowd scenes have witnessed
   an increased demand in different applications, such as safety, security,
   entertainment, and personal mental health. Although many methods have
   been proposed, certain limitations exist, and many unresolved issues
   remain open. In this paper, we proposed a novel spatio-temporal sparse
   coding representation, based on sparse coded features with k-means
   singular value decomposition for robust classification of crowd
   behaviors. Extensive experiments have shown that dictionary learning
   method with sparsely coded features captured vital structures of video
   scenes and yielded discriminant descriptors for classifications than
   conventional bag-of-visual-features. Relying on the measurable features
   of crowd scenes and motion characteristics, we can represent different
   attributes of the crowd scenes. Experiments on hundreds of video scenes
   were carried out on publicly available datasets. Quantitative evaluation
   indicates that the proposed model display superior accuracy, precision,
   and recall in classifying human behaviors with linear support vector
   machine when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed
   method is conceptually simple and easy to train: thereby achieving an
   accuracy of 93.50\%, a precision of 93.40\%, and a recall of 95.96\%.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose -Extensive efforts have been conducted on the real-time strategy
   (RTS) games. The purpose of this paper is the specific artificial
   intelligence (AI) challenges posed by RTS games; non-player character
   (NPC) is started out by collecting game-map resources to build up
   defenses and attack forces, to upgrade combat deployment.
   Design/methodology/approach -The authors used weak AI fuzzy theory as
   the foundation for tunable development. With the fuzzy theory, the AI
   was more humanistic in its judgment process.
   Findings -Well-developed AIs have been used brilliantly in various
   aspects in RTS games, especially in those developed by large production
   teams. For small production teams, how to develop an AI system in less
   time and at a lower cost is extremely important.
   Research limitations/implication -This study aimed to develop a system
   using player unit threat levels for NPC deployment and arrangement so
   that the further strategy would be adopted for NPCs in response to
   player actions.
   Originality/value -The RTS games would become more challenging for
   players to play.}},

Title = {{THE POWER OF LOCAL CONSISTENCY IN CONJUNCTIVE QUERIES AND CONSTRAINT
   SATISFACTION PROBLEMS}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1111-1145}},
Abstract = {{Answering conjunctive queries is a fundamental problem in database
   theory, and it is equivalent to solving constraint satisfaction problems
   in artificial intelligence and to other fundamental problems arising in
   computer science, which can be recast in terms of looking for
   homomorphisms between relational structures. The problem is NP-hard, so
   that several research efforts have been made in the literature for
   identifying tractable classes, known as islands of tractability, as well
   as for devising clever heuristics for solving efficiently real-world
   instances. Many heuristic approaches are based on enforcing on the given
   instance a property called local consistency (also, relational
   arc-consistency), where each tuple in every query atom matches at least
   one tuple in every other query atom. Interestingly, for many well-known
   classes of instances, such as for the acyclic ones, enforcing local
   consistency is even sufficient to solve the given instance correctly.
   However, the precise power of such a procedure was unclear, but for some
   very restricted cases. The paper provides answers to long-standing
   questions about the precise power of algorithms based on enforcing local
   consistency. The paper deals with both the general framework of tree
   projections, where local consistency is enforced among arbitrary views
   defined over the given database instance, and the specific cases where
   such views are computed according to the so-called structural
   decomposition methods, such as generalized hypertree width, component
   hypertree decompositions, and so on. Moreover, the paper deals with both
   decision and computation problems, by characterizing those tuples that
   are correct projections of query answers, which finds application in
   algorithms for answering queries and solving constraint satisfaction
   problems. As a relevant special case, the power of algorithms based on
   enforcing local consistency is characterized over the fundamental and
   deeply studied class of acyclic conjunctive queries. It turns out that
   local consistency provides the correct answer to a Boolean acyclic query
   if, and only if, the query is semantically acyclic.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{7055-7063}},
Abstract = {{Online hyper-heuristic selection is a novel and powerful approach to
   solving complex problems. This approach dynamically selects, based on
   the state of a given solution, the most promising operator (from a pool
   of operators) to continue the search process. The dynamic selection is
   usually based on the analysis of the latest applications of a given
   operator during actual execution, estimating the potential success of
   the operator at the current solution state. The estimation can be made
   by evolvability metrics. Calculating an evolvability metric is
   computationally expensive since it requires the generation and
   evaluation of a neighborhood of solutions. This paper aims to estimate
   the potential success of an operator for a given solution state by using
   a pre-trained neural network; known as a parallel perceptron. The
   proposal accelerates the online selection process, allowing us to
   achieve better performance than hyper-heuristic models, which directly
   use evolvability functions.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{8989-9004}},
Abstract = {{Educational data preprocessing from log files represents a
   time-consuming phase of the knowledge discovery process. It consists of
   data cleaning, user identification, session identification, and path
   completion phase. This paper attempts to identify phases, which are
   necessary in the case of preprocessing of educational data for further
   application of learning analytics methods. Since the sequential patterns
   analysis is considered suitable for estimating of discovered knowledge,
   this paper tries answering the question, which of these preprocessing
   phases has a significant impact on discovered knowledge in general, as
   well as in the meaning of quality and quantity of found sequence
   patterns. Therefore, several data preprocessing techniques for session
   identification and path completion were applied to prepare logfiles with
   different levels of data preprocessing. The results showed that the
   session identification technique using the reference length, calculated
   from the sitemap, had a significant impact on the quality of extracted
   sequence rules. The path completion technique had a significant impact
   only on the quantity of extracted sequence rules. The found results
   together with the results of the previous systematic research in
   educational data preprocessing can improve the automation of the
   educational data preprocessing phase as well as it can contribute to the
   development of learning analytics tools suitable for different groups of
   stakeholders engaged in the educational data mining research activities.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is set to become one of the key
   technological developments of our times provided we are able to realize
   its full potential. The number of objects connected to IoT is expected
   to reach 50 billion by 2020 due to the massive influx of diverse objects
   emerging progressively. IoT, hence, is expected to be a major producer
   of big data. Sharing and collaboration of data and other resources would
   be the key for enabling sustainable ubiquitous environments, such as
   smart cities and societies. A timely fusion and analysis of big data,
   acquired from IoT and other sources, to enable highly efficient,
   reliable, and accurate decision making and management of ubiquitous
   environments would be a grand future challenge. Computational
   intelligence would play a key role in this challenge. A number of
   surveys exist on data fusion. However, these are mainly focused on
   specific application areas or classifications. The aim of this paper is
   to review literature on data fusion for IoT with a particular focus on
   mathematical methods ( including probabilistic methods, artificial
   intelligence, and theory of belief) and specific IoT environments (
   distributed, heterogeneous, nonlinear, and object tracking
   environments). The opportunities and challenges for each of the
   mathematical methods and environments are given. Future developments,
   including emerging areas that would intrinsically benefit from data
   fusion and IoT, autonomous vehicles, deep learning for data fusion, and
   smart cities, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system
   (ANFIS) training algorithm, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm,
   is presented. Antecedent and conclusion parameters existing in the
   structure of ANFIS are optimized with the ABC algorithm and ANFIS
   training is realized. Identification of a set of nonlinear dynamic
   systems is performed in order to analyze the suggested training
   algorithm. The ABC algorithm is operated 30 times for each
   identification case and the average root mean square error (RMSE) value
   is obtained. Training RMSE values calculated for the four examples
   considered are 0.0325, 0.0215, 0.0174, and 0.0294, respectively. In
   addition, test error values for the same cases are respectively computed
   as 0.0270, 0.0186, 0.0167, and 0.0435. The results obtained are compared
   with those of known neuro-fuzzy-based methods frequently used in the
   literature in identification studies of nonlinear systems. It is shown
   that ANFIS can be trained successfully by using the ABC algorithm for
   the identification of nonlinear systems.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, affective computing has received much attention in the

   Sentiment orientation recognition of text is one of important parts in
   affective computing. A method is proposed to recognize the multi-label

   Firstly, sentiment orientation and intensity of sentiment words from
   texts are identified by sentiment lexicons, Tongyi Cilin and HowNet.
   Subsequently, sentiment orientation of text are divided into three
   domains, including positive, negative and boundary domain, according to
   their sentiment intensity and the appropriate decision-making
   thresholds. Lastly, sentiment orientations of texts in the boundary
   domain are distinguished pursuant to sentimental characteristics of
   sentences in texts. The results of experiments show that the method of
   multi-label sentiment analysis of Chinese text, based on three-way
   decisions, is effective for identifying sentiment orientations of texts.}},

Abstract = {{Provision of machining accuracy is a relevant objective in technology of
   mechanical engineering and its solution allows to guarantee an
   operational accuracy of mechanisms and machines, their wear resistance,
   reliability and durability. In order to solve the given task a method
   has been proposed in the paper that permits to ensure the highest
   machining accuracy margin on the basis of multiple-factor optimization
   of parameters for technological process while using methods of
   artificial intelligence. To ensure the machining accuracy by point
   tools, an intellectual system has been developed and it is based on
   technologies of functional semantic networks. For revealing correctness
   of SEMANTIC intellectual system operation an experimental inspection of
   its working capacity has been carried out in the paper. The paper
   contains description of the methodology for In article the technique of
   experimental investigations and their purpose is to make a comparative
   analysis of actual errors in opening machining with the machining errors
   predicted by the SEMANTIC system on the basis of functional semantic
   network application. The investigations have made it possible to
   determine dependences of axial misalignment in the machined openings on
   tool advance and its rotation frequency while making openings by
   high-speed steel drills. The paper presents analysis results of limiting
   and probable values for components of a total machining error. It has
   been shown that while making assessment of machining accuracy it is
   necessary to consider probabilistic nature of occurrence of total error
   components that are setting upper boundary as it is realized in the
   described intellectual system. The semantic network permits to compare
   errors in arrangement of opening axes which are machined in accordance
   with admissible drill advance and rotation frequency and corresponding
   experimental values. The experimental investigations prove the
   possibility to use an approach for forecasting a total machining error
   which is based on application of functional semantic network technology.}},

Title = {{Design and Voluntary Motion Intention Estimation of a Novel Wearable
   Full-Body Flexible Exoskeleton Robot}},
Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{The wearable full-body exoskeleton robot developed in this study is one
   application of mobile cyberphysical system (CPS), which is a complex
   mobile system integrating mechanics, electronics, computer science, and
   artificial intelligence. Steel wire was used as the flexible
   transmission medium and a group of special wire-locking structures was
   designed. Additionally, we designed passive joints for partial joints of
   the exoskeleton. Finally, we proposed a novel gait phase recognition
   method for full-body exoskeletons using only joint angular sensors,
   plantar pressure sensors, and inclination sensors. The method consists
   of four procedures. Firstly, we classified the three types of main
   motion patterns: normal walking on the ground, stair-climbing and
   stair-descending, and sit-to-stand movement. Secondly, we segregated the
   experimental data into one gait cycle. Thirdly, we divided one gait
   cycle into eight gait phases. Finally, we built a gait phase recognition
   model based on k-Nearest Neighbor perception and trained it with the
   phase-labeled gait data. The experimental result shows that the model
   has a 98.52\% average correct rate of classification of the main motion
   patterns on the testing set and a 95.32\% average correct rate of phase
   recognition on the testing set. So the exoskeleton robot can achieve
   human motion intention in real time and coordinate its movement with the
   wearer.}},

Title = {{Improving the Fine-Tuning of Metaheuristics: An Approach Combining
   Design of Experiments and Racing Algorithms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Usually, metaheuristic algorithms are adapted to a large set of problems
   by applying few modifications on parameters for each specific case.
   However, this flexibility demands a huge effort to correctly tune such
   parameters. Therefore, the tuning of metaheuristics arises as one of the
   most important challenges in the context of research of these
   algorithms. Thus, this paper aims to present a methodology combining
   Statistical and Artificial Intelligence methods in the fine-tuning of
   metaheuristics. The key idea is a heuristic method, called Heuristic
   Oriented Racing Algorithm (HORA), which explores a search space of
   parameters looking for candidate configurations close to a promising
   alternative. To confirm the validity of this approach, we present a case
   study for fine tuning two distinct metaheuristics: Simulated Annealing
   (SA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), in order to solve the classical
   traveling salesman problem. The results are compared considering the
   same metaheuristics tuned through a racing method. Broadly, the proposed
   approach proved to be effective in terms of the overall time of the
   tuning process. Our results reveal that metaheuristics tuned by means of
   HORA achieve, with much less computational effort, similar results
   compared to the case when they are tuned by the other fine-tuning
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) is a simple and powerful optimisation

   multiple searches, instead of single search, in employee and onlooker
   bee phases; 3) controlling the frequency of perturbation by a
   modification rate. The proposed algorithm implemented by C\# programming
   language and executed on benchmark functions of Sphere, Rosenbrock,
   Rastrigin, non-continuous Rastrigin, Griewank, Schwefel, Schwefel 1.2,
   Schwefel 2.2, Step and Ackley. The performance of proposed ABC algorithm
   is compared with ABC and modified ABC algorithms, on different tests,

Abstract = {{Type-2 Fuzzy Logic has emerged recently in Artificial Intelligence as a
   promising technique in control and decision making. According to the
   literature, type-2 fuzzy logic controllers (FLC) have been successfully
   applied in several applications. However, the big complexity in
   conceiving a controller consists fundamentally in fixing the membership
   functions of the fuzzy parameters, specifically on how to fix the
   footprint of uncertainties associated to antecedent and consequent
   parts, which depends strongly on the current used application. In the
   case of real-robot navigation, modelling a fuzzy controller is quite
   tricky, given the presence of several types of uncertainties. In
   addition, at the level of autonomous navigation, several challenges may
   arise : how to carefully avoid obstacles, keep the vehicle safe, avoid
   slipping and most importantly reach the target. In this paper, we
   proposed an adaptive learning type-2 FLC for a robot navigation. From an
   initial space which represents a feasible solution, we used the PSO to
   find a smooth solution with less oscillations. The designed structure
   achieved good performance shown in the ``iRobot Create{''} robot.}},

   importance of having transparent inspection of intelligent agents and
   provides guidance for good practice when developing such agents. By
   considering and expanding upon other prominent definitions found in
   literature, we provide a robust definition of transparency as a
   mechanism to expose the decision-making of a robot. The paper continues
   by addressing potential design decisions developers need to consider
   when designing and developing transparent systems. Finally, we describe
   our new interactive intelligence editor, designed to visualise, develop
   and debug real-time intelligence.}},

   more in favour), 1 majority support (53\%), with several of the
   remaining receiving mixed support of between 33\% and 47\%. An important
   and unanimous conclusion of the workshop was that the Principles should
   be amended through a thorough and inclusive process. Adopted proposals
   also highlighted the need to focus on the protection of humanity from
   possible future risks created by AI and robotics, and to take into
   account how society is changing and adapting to technological advances.}},

Title = {{Logics of Common Ground}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{859-904}},
Abstract = {{According to Clark's seminal work on common ground and grounding,
   participants collaborating in a joint, activity rely on their shared
   information, known as common ground, to perform that activity
   successfully, and continually align and augment this information during
   their collaboration. Similarly, teams of human and artificial agents
   require common ground to successfully participate in joint activities.
   Indeed, without appropriate information being shared, using agent
   autonomy to reduce the workload on humans may actually increase workload
   as the humans seek to understand why the stems are behaving as they are.
   While many researchers have identified the importance of common ground
   in artificial intelligence, there is no precise definition of common
   ground on which to build the foundational aspects of multi-agent
   collaboration. In this paper, building previously-defined model logics
   of belief, we present logic definitions for four different We define
   modal logics for three existing notions of common ground and introduce a
   new notion of common ground, called salient common. ground. Salient
   common ground captures the common ground of a group participating in an
   activity and is based on the common ground that arises from that
   activity as well as on the common ground they shared prior to the
   activity. We show that the four definitions,share some properties, and
   our analysis suggests possible refinements of the existing informal and
   semi-formal definitions.}},

Abstract = {{Interval temporal logics provide a natural framework for reasoning about
   interval structures over linearly ordered domains. Despite being
   relevant for a broad spectrum of application domains, ranging from

   efficiently supporting them. We approach the finite satisfiability
   problem for one of the simplest meaningful interval temporal logic,
   namely A (also known as Right Propositional Neighborhood Logic) and we
   propose three different multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to solve
   it by means of a metaheuristic for multi-objective optimization. The
   resulting semidecision procedure, although incomplete, turns out to be
   easier to implement and more scalable with respect to classical complete

Journal = {{AI COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{169-190}},
Abstract = {{Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a very common technique for
   dimensionality reduction problems as a preprocessing step for machine
   learning and pattern classification applications. At the same time, it
   is usually used as a black box, but (sometimes) not well understood. The
   aim of this paper is to build a solid intuition for what is LDA, and how
   LDA works, thus enabling readers of all levels be able to get a better
   understanding of the LDA and to know how to apply this technique in
   different applications. The paper first gave the basic definitions and
   steps of how LDA technique works supported with visual explanations of
   these steps. Moreover, the two methods of computing the LDA space, i.e.
   class-dependent and class-independent methods, were explained in
   details. Then, in a step-by-step approach, two numerical examples are
   demonstrated to show how the LDA space can be calculated in case of the
   class-dependent and class-independent methods. Furthermore, two of the
   most common LDA problems (i.e. Small Sample Size (SSS) and non-linearity
   problems) were highlighted and illustrated, and state-of-the-art
   solutions to these problems were investigated and explained. Finally, a
   number of experiments was conducted with different datasets to (1)
   investigate the effect of the eigenvectors that used in the LDA space on
   the robustness of the extracted feature for the classification accuracy,
   and (2) to show when the SSS problem occurs and how it can be addressed.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{5858-5869}},
Abstract = {{A recurring problem faced when training neural networks is that there is
   typically not enough data to maximize the generalization capability of
   deep neural networks. There are many techniques to address this,
   including data augmentation, dropout, and transfer learning. In this
   paper, we introduce an additional method, which we call smart
   augmentation and we show how to use it to increase the accuracy and
   reduce over fitting on a target network. Smart augmentation works, by
   creating a network that learns how to generate augmented data during the
   training process of a target network in a way that reduces that networks
   loss. This allows us to learn augmentations that minimize the error of
   that network. Smart augmentation has shown the potential to increase
   accuracy by demonstrably significant measures on all data sets tested.
   In addition, it has shown potential to achieve similar or improved
   performance levels with significantly smaller network sizes in a number
   of tested cases.}},

Abstract = {{Applied quantile regression to explore different ways to improve the
   catering service so as to promote the customer's service satisfaction.A
   lean service project aims to reduce the cost of material, labor and time
   required in providing a service to a customer so as to promote the
   service satisfaction from the customer. This paper presents a data
   mining approach to analyze the effectiveness of a lean service project
   on a catering service provided by a university restaurant. We have
   designed three consecutive stages of service scenarios; each represents
   an improvement over its previous stage. In this study, we first applied
   the grey relational analysis to confirm the effectiveness of the lean
   service project. That is, stage two and three actually obtained higher
   service satisfaction from customers than their corresponding previous
   stages did. We have performed a quantile regression analysis to explore
   the effect of different factors on low and high quantiles of service
   satisfaction. The result of the quantile regression analysis provides
   different ways for the restaurant to improve its customer's service
   satisfaction. Finally, we have built several prediction models to
   forecast the service satisfaction (Poor or Good) of a service sample.
   The experimental result showed that among the eight prediction models,
   FOAGRNN is the best in terms of the sensitivity, specificity, AUC and
   Gini performance measures.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEW MUSIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{175-186}},
Abstract = {{Can a computer play a music score, e.g. via a Disklavier, in a way that
   cannot be distinguished from a human performance of the same music? One
   hundred and seventy-two participants with a wide range of music playing
   backgrounds rated sound recordings of 7 performances of piano music by
   Kuhlau, one played by a human, and six generated by algorithms,
   including a mechanical' and an unmusical' rendering. Participants rated
   the extent to which each performance was by a human and explained their
   answers. The mechanical performance had the lowest mean rating, but the
   human performance was rated as statistically identical to the other
   stimuli. There were no differences between ratings made by classical
   piano experts and lay listeners, but despite this, the musicians were
   more confident with their ratings. Qualitative analysis revealed five
   broad themes that contribute to judging whether a piece appears to be
   human. The themes were labelled (in descending order of frequency)
   intuitive, expressive, imperfections, halo (global preference) and
   empathy. This paper presents new evidence systematically demonstrating
   that algorithm generated performances of piano music can be
   indistinguishable from human performances, suggesting some parallels
   with the 1990s victory of the Deep Blue computer of the world champion
   (human) chess player.}},

Abstract = {{Computer games are becoming a primary source of entertainment due to
   modern day computers and high resolution graphics. Game developers are
   now getting interested to quantitatively measure the entertainment value
   of games. In addition to its contents, entertainment value also depends
   on the particular genre of the game. In this work we introduce a set of
   entertainment metrics for the predator/prey genre of games. Further, we
   employ the proposed metrics for automatic generation of entertaining
   games using an evolutionary algorithm. The evolutionary algorithm starts
   with an initial set of randomly generated games and is guided by the
   entertainment metrics towards more entertaining population of games. The
   results produced are counter-checked against the entertainment criteria
   of human by conducting a human user survey and a controller learning
   ability experiment. The proposed system serves as an expert system,
   based on computational intelligence techniques, for automatic generation
   of entertaining games.}},

Abstract = {{Agent-oriented programming (AOP) represents a novel programming paradigm
   that adopts concepts and technologies of multi-agent system to implement
   software. It has gained great attentions of researchers and
   practitioners from both artificial intelligence field and software
   engineering field. Dozens of AOP languages have been proposed in the
   past two decades. However the acceptance and adoption of AOP in software
   engineering community remain limited and the current practices of
   applying AOP do not convince such paradigm has extensively exploited its
   technical advantages and potentials. The experiences and practices of
   programming language researches in software engineering field can give
   us some inspirations to get out of the dilemma. The paper aims at
   providing a survey of AOP from software engineering perspectives,
   including its research history and the state-of-the-art of researches on
   agent-oriented programming concepts and models, languages, CASE tools
   and running manners. We investigate how current AOP studies satisfy
   design principles of programming language like simplicity, regularity,
   maintainability, expressiveness, reliability and efficiency, discuss
   several challenges of AOP researches and practices, and point out some

Abstract = {{The optimal power flow (OPF) problem considers as an optimization
   problem, in which the utility strives to reduce its global costs while
   pleasing all of its constraints. Therefore, Interior Search Algorithm
   (ISA) is applied to treat this problem. Where, ISA is a specific type of
   artificial intelligence and a mathematical programming, not a
   meta-heuristic algorithm. The effectiveness of this method in solving
   the OPF problem is evaluated on two test power systems, the IEEE 30-bus
   and the IEEE 57-bus test systems. For the first example, the ISA-OPF
   algorithm finds an answer that agrees with published results. For the
   57-bus system, the ISA-OPF demonstrates its ability to transact with
   larger systems. Thus, the ISA-OPF algorithm is shown to be a robust tool
   to treat this optimization compared with other methods. Moreover, the
   advantage of ISA is that it has only one parameter of control which
   makes the simplicity in the main algorithm.}},

Journal = {{CONNECTION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{160-169}},
Abstract = {{The thought-provoking EPSRC Principles of Robotics stem largely from the
   reflection on the extent to which robots can affect our lives. These
   comments highlight the fact that, while the principles may address to a
   good extent the present technological challenges, they appear to be less
   immediately suited for future technological and conceptual dares. The
   first part of the paper is dedicated to the search of the definition of
   what a robot is. Such a definition should offer the basic conceptual
   platform on which a normative endeavour, aiming to regulate robots in
   society, should be based. Concluding that the Principles offer no clear
   yet flexible insight into such a (meta-) definition, which would allow
   one to take into account the parameters of informed technological
   imagination and of envisaged social transformation, the second half of
   the paper highlights a number of regulatory points of tension. Such
   tensions, it is argued, stem largely from the absence of an appropriate
   conceptual platform, influencing negatively the extent to which the
   principles can be effective in guiding social, ethical, legal and
   scientific conduct.}},

Pages = {{5-24}},
Abstract = {{DLV is a powerful system for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
   which supports Answer Set Programming (ASP) - a logic-based programming
   paradigm for solving problems in a fully declarative way. DLV is
   currently widely used in academy, and, importantly, it has been
   fruitfully employed in many relevant industrial applications. Similarly
   to the other main-stream ASP systems, while processing an input program,
   in a first phase of the computation DLV eliminates the variables, thus
   generating a ground program which is semantically equivalent to the
   original one, but significantly smaller than the Herbrand Instantiation,
   in general. This phase, called `grounding', plays a key role for the
   successful deployment in real-world contexts. In this work we present
   I-DLV, a brand new version of the intelligent grounder of DLV. While
   relying on the solid theoretical foundations of its predecessor, it has
   been completely redesigned and re-engineered, both in algorithms and
   data structures; it nowfeatures full support to ASP-Core-2 standard
   language, increased flexibility and customizability, significantly
   improved performance, and an extensible design that eases the
   incorporation of language updates and optimization techniques.
   I-DLVresults in a stable and efficient ASP instantiator, that turns out
   to be a full-fledged deductive database system. We describe here the
   main features of I-DLVand present the results of proper experimental
   activities for assessing both its applicability and performance.}},

Pages = {{81-92}},
Abstract = {{Logic Programming is a programming paradigm widely used for teaching
   Artificial Intelligence in university courses. Prolog, probably the most
   popular Logic Programming language, is based on inferences similar to
   theorem provers, and learning it is propaedeutical for understanding
   formal specification languages.
   However, after a first phase in which students learn how specifications
   can be translated into executable code, a second phase is necessary for
   engineering the resulting program. In this second phase, having a clear
   picture of the execution model is crucial.
   In this paper, SLDNF-Draw, a program that visualizes the SLDNF
   operational semantics of Prolog, is presented. SLDNFDraw produces trees
   in LATEX, the popular typesetting system, so that the generated trees
   have very high typographic quality and can be embedded in printed
   documents (e.g., course handouts) as well as in animated presentations.
   SLDNF Draw is completely written in Prolog, as a meta-interpreter, and
   does not rely on external imperative languages for the visualization.}},

Abstract = {{Big data have revealed unexpected and statistically significant
   correlations along with intractable propositions. In order to address
   this development, an algorithm is introduced that is consistent with
   Ramsey's theorem for pairs and Godel's incompleteness theorem. The
   algorithm assigns one of three truth values to a fuzzy proposition in
   order to update automatic theorem proving. A unique feature of the
   algorithm is an AI module that selects the multiple axiom sets needed
   for a proof. A metric for the AI module is the probability that the
   database of axiom sets is inadequate for the context. The importance of
   context is illustrated by a simple analog electrical circuit applied to
   Fermat's last theorem as contrasted with a similar exponential equation
   having positive real numbers for bases. Another algorithm or decision
   tree is introduced to differentiate risk factors from necessary
   conditions. A failure to recognize this distinction has impaired the
   public health sector for centuries and continues to do so. The second
   algorithm introduced here represents an effort to conserve science in
   general. The risk that big data pose for science is the misuse of
   positive, statistically significant correlations to infer causality when
   the correlations actually reflect risk factors or even rare
   coincidences.}},

   power and the transmission towers used for its distribution. These
   towers have underground electrodes which must be reviewed on a regular
   basis by controlling different parameters to ensure that electrical
   resistance is in a secure range in order to avoid problems and risks.
   Using artificial intelligence, it is possible to ensure proper
   maintenance of the towers by estimating the required values and
   proposing a reduction in the size of the population sample, which will
   minimize the cost of operation. The use of an intelligent-agent
   virtual-organization based architecture is proposed within this working
   environment. By using mathematical estimation models and agreement based
   negotiations, the architecture is capable of maximizing estimations and
   minimizing associated costs. The proposed model has been evaluated with
   the developed software through a real case study, which permitted us to
   validate the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the intersection of
   artificial intelligence (AI), computational thinking (CT), and
   mathematics education (ME) for young students (K-8). Specifically, it
   focuses on three key elements that are common to AI, CT and ME: agency,
   modeling of phenomena and abstracting concepts beyond specific
   instances.
   Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical framework of this paper
   adopts a sociocultural perspective where knowledge is constructed in
   interactions with others (Vygotsky, 1978). Others also refers to
   themultiplicity of technologies that surround us, including both the
   digital artefacts of our new media world, and the human methods and
   specialized processes acting in the world. Technology is not simply a
   tool for human intention. It is an actor in the cognitive ecology of
   immersive humans-with-technology environments (Levy, 1993, 1998) that
   supports but also disrupts and reorganizes human thinking (Borba and
   Villarreal, 2005).
   Findings - There is fruitful overlap between AI, CT and ME that is of
   value to consider in mathematics education.
   Originality/value - Seeing ME through the lenses of other disciplines
   and recognizing that there is a significant overlap of key elements
   reinforces the importance of agency, modeling and abstraction in ME and
   provides new contexts and tools for incorporating them in classroom
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Stock prediction is generally considered to be challenging and known for
   its high noise and strong nonlinearities in financial time series
   analysis. However, current forecasting models ignore the importance of
   model parameter optimisation and the use of recent data. In this
   article, a novel forecasting approach with a Bayesian-regularised
   artificial neural networks (BR-ANN) was proposed. The weight of the
   proposed model (BR-ANN) is determined by the particle swarm optimisation
   (PSO) algorithm. Daily market prices and financial technical indicators
   are utilised as inputs to predict the one day future closing price of
   the Shanghai (in China) composite index. The Bayesian-regularised
   network uses a probabilistic nature for the network weights and can
   reduce the potential for over-fitting and over-training. Our empirical
   study and the results of our K-line theory analysis indicate that PSO is
   determined to be an effective algorithm to optimise the parameters of
   the Bayesian neural network compared with other well-known prediction
   algorithms. In particular, the PSO model is more reliable than the
   simple Bayesian regularisation neural network near the local maximum

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTATION}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{93-105}},
Abstract = {{Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) has attracted much attention and is
   used to wide applications in different fields in recent years because of
   its simple concept, easy implementation and quick convergence. However,
   it suffers from premature convergence since the population's diversity
   loses quickly. In this paper, a novel and efficient variant of PSO named
   DNIPSO is proposed which help the diversity of the swarm be preserved
   via the Newman-Watts small world network topology and the immune
   learning operator. Initially the topology of the population is the
   regular network. Then the Newman-Watts small world topology is formed
   gradually and the swarm evolves simultaneously. The optimisation process
   contains the population structure dynamics and particle immune learning
   two parts which mutually promoted effectively in whole population.
   Furthermore, the immune operator which is based on the clonal selection
   theory achieves a trade-off between exploration and exploitation
   abilities. Numerical experiments both on continuous unconstrained and
   constrained benchmark functions are used to test the performance of
   DNIPSO. Simulation results show it is effective and robust.}},

Pages = {{65-74}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Many organizations are seeking unicorn data scientists, that
   rarest of breeds that can do it all. They are said to be experts in many
   traditionally distinct disciplines, including mathematics, statistics,
   computer science, artificial intelligence, and more. The purpose of this
   paper is to describe authors' pursuit of these elusive mythical
   creatures.
   Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative data were collected through
   semi-structured interviews with managers/directors from nine Australian
   state and federal government agencies with relatively mature data
   science functions.
   Findings - Although the authors failed to find evidence of unicorn data
   scientists, they are pleased to report on six key roles that are
   considered to be required for an effective data science team. Primary
   and secondary skills for each of the roles are identified and the
   resulting framework is then used to illustratively evaluate three data
   science Master-level degrees offered by Australian universities.
   Research limitations/implications - Given that the findings presented in
   this paper have been based on a study with large government agencies
   with relatively mature data science functions, they may not be directly
   transferable to less mature, smaller, and less well-resourced agencies
   and firms.
   Originality/value - The skills framework provides a theoretical
   contribution that may be applied in practice to evaluate and improve the
   composition of data science teams and related training programs.}},

Abstract = {{Self-learning process is an important factor that enables learners to
   improve their own educational experiences when they are away of
   face-to-face interactions with the teacher. A well-designed
   self-learning activity process supports both learners and teachers to
   achieve educational objectives rapidly. Because of this, there has
   always been a remarkable trend on developing alternative self-learning
   approaches. In this context, this study is based on two essential
   objectives. Firstly, it aims to introduce an intelligent software
   system, which optimizes and improves computer engineering students'
   self-learning processes. Secondly, it aims to improve computer
   engineering students' self-learning during the courses. As general, the
   software system introduced here evaluates students' intelligence levels
   according to the Theory of Multiple Intelligences and supports their
   learning via accurately chosen materials provided over the software
   interface. The evaluation mechanism of the system is based on a hybrid
   Artificial Intelligence approach formed by an Artificial Neural Network,
   and an optimization algorithm called as Vortex Optimization Algorithm
   (VOA). The system is usable for especially technical courses taught at
   computer engineering departments of universities and makes it easier to
   teach abstract subjects. For having idea about success of the system, it
   has been tested with students and positive results on optimizing and
   improving self-learning have been obtained. Additionally, also a
   technical evaluation has been done previously, in order to see if the
   VOA is a good choice to be used in the system. It can be said that the
   whole obtained results encourage the authors to continue to future
   works. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   drive global economic growth. The use of distance eTeaching and
   eLearning (DTL) is on the rise among digital natives alongside our
   evolution toward smart societies. However, the DTL systems today lack
   the necessary sophistication due to several challenges including data
   analysis and management, learner-system interactivity, system cognition,
   resource planning, agility, and scalability. This paper proposes a
   personalised Ubiquitous eTeaching \& eLearning (UTiLearn) framework that
   leverages Internet of Things, big data, supercomputing, and deep
   learning to provide enhanced development, management, and delivery of
   teaching and learning in smart society settings. A proof of concept
   UTiLearn system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed
   design, implementation, and evaluation of the UTiLearn system, including
   its five components, are provided using 11 widely used datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Recommender systems apply artificial intelligence techniques for
   filtering unseen information and predict whether a user would
   like/dislike a given item. K-Means clustering-based recommendation
   algorithms have been proposed claiming to increase the scalability of
   recommender systems. One potential drawback of these algorithms is that
   they perform training offline and hence cannot accommodate the
   incremental updates with the arrival of new data, making them unsuitable
   for the dynamic environments. From this line of research, a new
   clustering algorithm called One-Pass is proposed, which is a simple
   realtime algorithm that maintains a good level of accuracy, scale well
   with data, and build the training model incrementally with the arrival
   of new data. We run One-Pass algorithm on four different datasets
   (MovieLens, Film Trust, Book Crossing, and Last-FM) and empirically show
   that the proposed algorithm outperforms K-Means in terms of
   recommendation and training time. Moreover, One-Pass algorithm is
   comparable to K-Means in term of accuracy and cluster quality.}},

Abstract = {{The lives of U.S. soldiers in combat depend on complex weapon systems
   and advanced technologies. In combat conditions, the resources available
   to support the operation and maintenance of these systems are minimal.
   Following the failure of a critical system, technical support personnel
   may take days to arrive via helicopter or ground convoy-leaving soldiers
   and civilian experts exposed to battlefield risks. To address this
   problem, the U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM)
   developed a suite of systems, Virtual Logistics Assistance
   Representative (VLAR), with a single purpose: to enable a combat soldier
   to maintain critical equipment. The CECOM VLAR team uses an operations
   research (OR) approach to codifying expert knowledge about Army
   equipment and applying that knowledge to troubleshooting equipment
   diagnostics in combat situations. VLAR infuses a classic
   knowledge-management spiral with OR techniques: from socializing
   advanced technical concepts and eliciting tacit knowledge, to
   integrating expert knowledge, to creating an intuitive and instructive
   interface, and finally, to making VLAR a part of a soldier's daily life.
   VLAR is changing the Army's sustainment paradigm by creating an
   artificial intelligence capability and applying it to equipment
   diagnostics. In the process, it has generated a sustainable cost-savings
   model and a means to mitigate combat risk. Through 2015, VLAR saved the
   Army \$27 million in direct labor costs from an investment of \$8
   million by reducing the requirement for technical support personnel. We
   project additional direct costs savings of \$222 million from an
   investment of \$60 million by the end of 2020. Most importantly, VLAR
   has prevented an estimated 4,500 casualties by reducing requirements for
   helicopter and ground-convoy movements. This translates to short- and
   long-term medical cost savings of over \$9 billion. In this paper, we
   discuss the OR methods that underpin VLAR, at the heart of which lie
   causal Bayesian networks, and we detail the process we use to translate
   scientific theory and experiential knowledge into accessible
   applications for equipment diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{Acid gas removal (AGR) units are widely used to remove CO2 and H2S from
   sour gas streams in natural gas processing. When foaming occurs in an
   AGR system, the efficiency of the process extremely decreases. In this
   paper, a novel approach is suggested to regularly predict the gas dew
   point temperature (GDPT) in order to anticipate the foaming conditions.
   Prediction of GDPT is advantageous because the conventional methods of
   measuring GDPT such as: (i) using a chilled mirror device is time
   consuming; and (ii) the use of gas chromatograph for composition
   determination combined with the equation-of-state calculations involve
   column retention time and is expensive. New hybrid modeling algorithms
   based on the artificial neural network (ANN) combined with either the
   imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) or particle swarm optimization
   (PSO) are employed to model the process. The models can then be used to
   prevent the foaming phenomenon. The proposed algorithms combine the
   local searching ability of ANN with the global searching abilities of
   ICA and PSO. ICA and PSO are used to optimize the initial weights of the
   neural networks. The resulting ICA-ANN and PSO-ANN combined algorithms
   are then applied to model the occurrence of foaming in the AGR plant
   based on a simulation data set acquired from the 6th refinery of the
   south Pars gas complex in Iran. The performances of the ICA-ANN, PSO-ANN
   and conventional ANN models are then compared against each other. It was
   found that the accuracies of the ICA-ANN and PSO-ANN models are better
   than that of the conventional ANN model. In addition, the PSO-ANN model
   outperformed the ICA-ANN model.}},

Abstract = {{In sustainable supply chain networks, companies are obligated to have a
   systematic decision support system in place to help it adopt right
   decisions at right times. Among strategic decisions, supplier selection
   and evaluation outranks other decisions in terms of importance due to
   its long-term impacts. Besides, the adoption of such strategic decision
   entails exploring several factors that contribute to the complexity of
   decision making in the supply chain. For the purpose of solving
   non-linear regression problems, a novel neural network technique known
   as least squaresupport vector machine (LS-SVM) with maximum
   generalization ability has successfully been implemented. However, the
   performance quality of the LS-SVM is recognized to notoriously vary
   depending on the rigorous selection of its parameters. Therefore, in
   this paper, a continuous general variable neighborhood search (CGVNS)
   which is an effective meta-heuristic algorithm to solve the real world
   engineering continuous optimization problems is proposed to be
   integrated with LS-SVM. The CGVNS is hybridized in our novel integrated
   LS-SVM and CGVNS model, to tune the parameters of the LS-SVM to better
   estimate performance rating of supplier selection and evaluation
   problem. To demonstrate the improved performance of our proposed
   integrated model, a real data set from a case study of a supplier
   selection and evaluation problem is presented in a cosmetics industry.
   Additionally, comparative evaluations between our proposed model and the
   conventional techniques, namely nonlinear regression, multi-layer
   perceptron (MLP) neural network and LS-SVM is provided. The experimental
   results simply manifest the outperformance of our proposed model in
   terms of estimation accuracy and effective prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Almost all the worldwide and nationwide companies utilize advertising to
   increase their sales volume and profit. These companies pay millions of
   dollars to reach consumers and announce their products or services. This
   forces companies to evaluate advertising effects and check whether ads
   meet companys strategies. They need to evaluate the ads not only after
   announcement, but also before advertising, i.e. they can be one step
   ahead by predicting the future advertising awareness through artificial
   intelligence tools such as fuzzy systems and neural networks. In this
   study, we propose to use adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
   and artificial neural network (ANN) to analyze advertising decision
   making. ANFIS creates fuzzy rules and trains the neural network using
   given input data. This training ability of ANFIS and ANN leads to
   predicting the advertising awareness outputs. Here, we investigate three
   advertising awareness outputs, namely, top of mind, share of voice, and
   spontaneous awareness. In order to achieve the valid predictions, data
   are randomly divided into training data with 70 percent, validation data
   with 15 percent, and testing data with remained 15 percent of data. The
   correlation between actual data and predictions are calculated to check
   the accuracy of the predicted outputs.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of non-technical losses (NIL) which include electricity theft,
   faulty meters or billing errors has attracted increasing attention from
   researchers in electrical engineering and computer science. NTLs cause
   significant harm to the economy, as in some countries they may range up
   to 40\% of the total electricity distributed. The predominant research
   direction is employing artificial intelligence to predict whether a
   customer causes NTL. This paper first provides an overview of how NTLs
   are defined and their impact on economies, which include loss of revenue
   and profit of electricity providers and decrease of the stability and
   reliability of electrical power grids. It then surveys the
   state-of-the-art research efforts in a up-to-date and comprehensive
   review of algorithms, features and data sets used. It finally identifies
   the key scientific and engineering challenges in NIL detection and
   suggests how they could be addressed in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are starting to provide new
   possibilities to human societies and their demand is growing according
   to the new industrial application fields for these revolutionary tools.
   The current systems are still evolving, specially from an Artificial
   Intelligence perspective, which is increasing the different tasks that
   UAVs can perform. However, the current state still requires a strong
   human supervision. As a consequence, a good preparation forUAVoperators
   is mandatory due to some of their applications might affect human
   safety. During the training process, it is important to measure the
   performance of these operators according to different factors that can
   help to decide what operators are more suitable for different kinds of
   missions creating operator profiles. Having this goal in mind, this work
   aims to present an extensive and robust methodology to automatically
   extract different performance profiles from the training process of
   operators in an UAV simulation environment. Our method combines the
   definition of a set of performance metrics with clustering techniques to
   define operators profiles, ensuring that the behavior discrimination is

Pages = {{1575-1584}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose the Neural Knowledge DNA, a framework that
   tailors the ideas underlying the success of neural networks to the scope
   of knowledge representation. Knowledge representation is a fundamental
   field that dedicates to representing information about the world in a
   form that computer systems can utilize to solve complex tasks. The
   proposed Neural Knowledge DNA is designed to support discovering,
   storing, reusing, improving, and sharing knowledge among machines and
   computing devices. It is constructed in a similar fashion of how DNA
   formed: built up by four essential elements. As the DNA produces
   phenotypes, the Neural Knowledge DNA carries information and knowledge
   via its four essential interrelated elements, namely, Networks,
   Experiences, States, and Actions; which store the detail of the
   artificial neural networks for training and reusing such knowledge. The
   novelty of this approach is that it uses previous decisional experience
   to collect and expand intelligence for future decision making formalized
   support. The experience based collective computational techniques of Set
   of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS) and Decisional DNA (DDNA) are
   used to develop aforesaid decisional sustenance. Together with
   artificial neural networks and reinforcement learning, the proposed
   Neural Knowledge DNA is used to catch knowledge of a very simple maze
   problem, and the results show that our Neural Knowledge DNA is a very
   promising knowledge representation approach for artificial neural
   network-based intelligent systems.}},

   Design/methodology/approach - The brightness and luminosity are the
   decision variables in proposed study. The paper achieves the two major
   goals of robot navigation; first, the optimum path generation and,
   second, as an obstacle avoidance by co-in-centric sphere-based
   geometrical technique. This technique comprises the optimum path
   decision to objective function and constraints to paths and obstacles as
   the function of algebraic-geometry co-relation. Co-in-centric sphere is
   the proposed technique to correlate the constraints.
   Findings - It is found that the present FA based on concentric sphere is
   suitable for efficient navigation of mobile robots at the level of
   optimum significance when compared with other approaches.
   Originality/value - The paper introduces a novel approach to implement

   novel strategies to handle constraints}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{58-70}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) is well known as a complex mixed
   integer nonlinear optimization problem where many constraints are
   required to handle. In the last decades, many artificial
   intelligence-based optimization methods have been used to solve ORPD
   problem. But, these optimization methods lack an effective means to
   handle constraints on state variables. Thus, in this paper, the novel
   and feasible conditional selection strategies (CSS) are devised to
   handle constraints efficiently in the proposed improved gravitational
   search algorithm (GSA-CSS). In addition, considering the weakness of GSA
   itself, the improved GSA-CSS (IGSA-CSS) is presented which employs the
   memory property of particle swarm optimization (PSO) to enhance global
   searching ability and utilizes the concept of opposition based learning
   (OBL) for optimizing initial population. The presented GSA-CSS and
   IGSA-CSS methods are applied to ORPD problem on IEEE14-bus, IEEE30-bus
   and IEEE57-bus test systems for minimization of power transmission
   losses (P-loss) and voltage deviation (V-d), respectively. The
   comparisons of simulation results reveal that IGSA-CSS provides better
   results and the improvements of algorithm in this work are feasible and
   effective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This work deals with the analysis and prediction of the behavior of a
   Gas Turbine (GT), the Mitsubishi single shaft Turbo-Generator Model
   MS6001, which has a 30MW generation capacity. GTs such as this are of
   great importance in industry, as drivers of gas compressors for power
   generation. Because of their complexity and their execution environment,
   the failure rate of GTs can be high with severe consequences. These
   units are subjected to transient operations due to starts, load changes
   and sudden stops that degrade the system over time. To better understand
   the dynamic behavior of the turbine and to mitigate the aforementioned
   problems, these transient conditions need to be analyzed and predicted.
   In the absence of a thermodynamic mathematical model, other approaches
   should be considered to construct representative models that can be used
   for condition monitoring of the GT, to predict its behavior and detect
   possible system malfunctions. One way to derive such models is to use
   data-driven approaches based on machine learning and artificial
   intelligence. This work studies the use of state-of-the-art genetic
   programming (GP) methods to model the Mitsubishi single shaft
   Turbo-Generator. In particular, we evaluate and compare variants of GP
   and geometric semantic GP (GSGP) to build models that predict the fuel
   flow of the unit and the exhaust gas temperature. Results show that an
   algorithm, proposed by the authors, that integrates a local search
   mechanism with GP (GP-LS) outperforms all other state-of-the-art
   variants studied here on both problems, using real-world and
   representative data recorded during normal system operation. Moreover,
   results show that GP-LS outperforms seven other modeling techniques,
   including neural networks and isotonic regression, confirming the
   importance of GP-based algorithms in this domain. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In addition to dominance-based and decomposition-based algorithms,
   performance indicator-based algorithms have been widely used and
   investigated in the field of evolutionary multi-objective optimisation.
   This study proposes a multi-objective artificial bee colony optimisation
   method called epsilon-MOABC?-MOABC based on performance indicators to
   solve multi-objective and many-objective problems. The proposed
   algorithm develops an external archive on the basis of both Pareto
   dominance and preference indicators to save the non-dominated solutions
   produced in each generation. The population of the presented algorithm
   includes employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. Employed bees
   adjust their trajectories according to the information provided by other
   employed bees. Motivated by employed bees, onlooker bees select food
   sources to update their positions according to a power law probability,
   with which the food sources with high quality have a high probability to
   be selected for exploration. The quality of food sources is calculated
   on the basis of the quality indicator I epsilon+. Scout bees dispose of
   food sources with poor quality. The proposed algorithm proves to be
   competitive in dealing with multi-objective and many-objective
   optimisation problems in comparison with other state-of-the-art
   algorithms for CEC09, LZ09, and DTLZ test instances. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{An investigation of the suitability of Artificial Neural Networks for
   the prediction of core and local skin temperatures when trained with
   alarge and gender-balanced database}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{327-343}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Neural networks have been proven to successfully predict the results of
   complex non-linear problems in a variety of research fields, including
   medical research. Yet there is paucity of models utilising intelligent
   systems in the field of thermoregulation. They are under-utilized for
   predicting seemingly random physiological responses and in particular
   never used to predict local skin temperatures; or core temperature with
   a large dataset. In fact, most predictive models in this field
   (non-artificial intelligence based) focused on predicting body
   temperature and average skin temperature using relatively small
   gender-unbalanced databases or data from thermal dummies due to a lack
   of larger datasets.
   This paper aimed to address these limitations by applying Artificial
   Intelligence to create predictive models of core body temperature and
   local skin temperature (specifically at forehead, chest, upper arms,
   abdomen, knees and calves) while using a large and gender-balanced
   experimental database collected in office-type situations.
   A range of Neural Networks were developed for each local temperature,
   with topologies of 12 hidden layers and up to 20 neurons per layer,
   using Bayesian and the Levemberg-Marquardt back-propagation algorithms,
   and using various sets of input parameters (2520 NNs for each of the
   local skin temperatures and 1760 for the core temperature, i.e. a total
   of 19400 NNs). All topologies and configurations were assessed and the
   most suited recommended. The recommended Neural Networks trained well,
   with no sign of over-fitting, and with good performance when predicting
   unseen data. The recommended Neural Network for each case was compared
   with previously reported multi-linear models. Core temperature was
   avoided as a parameter for local skin temperatures as it is impractical
   for non-contact monitoring systems and does not significantly improve
   the precision despite it is the most stable parameter. The recommended
   NNs substantially improve the predictions in comparison to previous
   approaches. NN for core temperature has an R-value of 0.87 (81\%
   increase), and a precision of +/- 0.46 C for an 80\% CI which is
   acceptable for non-clinical applications. NNs for local skin
   temperatures had R-values of 0.85-0.93 for forehead, chest, abdomen,
   calves, knees and hands, last two being the strongest (increase of 72\%
   for abdomen, 63\% for chest, and 32\% for calves and forehead). The
   precision was best for forehead, chest and calves, with about +/- 1.2 C,
   which is similar to the precision of existent average skin temperature
   models even though the average value is more stable. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Behavior planning is an important function of any complex technical
   facility intelligent control system. Presently, a symbol paradigm of
   artificial intelligence offers a variety of planning algorithms,
   including those that use precedent information, i.e. algorithms based on
   acquired knowledge. A symbol grounding problem within the exiting
   approaches of knowledge representation does not allow effective use the
   developed algorithms together with learning mechanisms for the purpose
   of solving a wide variety of applied problems by actual intelligent
   agents (robotics systems). This article presents the original planning
   algorithm (MAP Planner), which uses a sign world model as the basis for
   acquisition and maintenance of knowledge for future use in behavior
   planning. the sign problem approach describes planning as a cognitive
   function actualized by the world model of a subject of activity. Apart
   from solving symbol grounding problems and ensuring psychological and
   biological plausibility, a sign planning process model allows
   interaction of an intelligent agent with other participants in solving a
   cooperative task. The article presents the description of the knowledge
   representation method used, a MAP planning algorithm, and a model

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The increasing application of process-oriented approaches in new
   challenging dynamic domains beyond business computing (e.g., healthcare,
   emergency management, factories of the future, home automation, etc.)
   has led to reconsider the level of flexibility and support required to
   manage complex knowledge-intensive processes in such domains. A
   knowledge-intensive process is influenced by user decision making and
   coupled with contextual data and knowledge production, and involves
   performing complex tasks in the ``physical{''} real world to achieve a
   common goal. The physical world, however, is not entirely predictable,
   and knowledge-intensive processes must be robust to unexpected
   conditions and adaptable to unanticipated exceptions, recognizing that
   in real-world environments it is not adequate to assume that all
   possible recovery activities can be predefined for dealing with the
   exceptions that can ensue. To tackle this issue, in this paper we
   present SmartPM, a model and a prototype Process Management System
   featuring a set of techniques providing support for automated adaptation
   of knowledge-intensive processes at runtime. Such techniques are able to
   automatically adapt process instances when unanticipated exceptions
   occur, without explicitly defining policies to recover from exceptions
   and without the intervention of domain experts at runtime, aiming at
   reducing error-prone and costly manual ad-hoc changes, and thus at
   relieving users from complex adaptations tasks. To accomplish this, we
   make use of well-established techniques and frameworks from Artificial
   Intelligence, such as situation calculus, IndiGolog and classical
   planning. The approach, which is backed by a formal model, has been
   implemented and validated with a case study based on real
   knowledge-intensive processes coming from an emergency management
   domain.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most challenging problems of sentiment analysis on social
   media is that labelling huge amounts of instances can be very expensive.
   Active learning has been proposed to overcome this problem and to
   provide means for choosing the most useful training instances. In this
   study, we introduce active learning to a framework which is comprised of
   most popular base and ensemble approaches for sentiment analysis. In
   addition, the implemented framework contains two ensemble approaches,
   i.e. a probabilistic algorithm and a derived version of Behavior
   Knowledge Space (BKS) algorithm. The Shannon Entropy approach was
   utilized for choosing among training data during active learning process
   and it was compared with maximum disagreement method and random
   selection of instances. It was observed that the former method causes
   better accuracies in less number of iterations. The above methods were
   tested on Cornell movie review dataset and a popular multi-domain
   product review dataset. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the dynamic difficulty adjustment on MOBA games as
   a way to improve the players entertainment. Although MOBA is currently
   one of the most played genres around the world, it is known as a game
   that offer less autonomy, more challenges and consequently more
   frustration. Due to these characteristics, the use of a mechanism that
   performs the difficulty balance dynamically seems to be an interesting
   alternative to minimize and/or avoid that players experience such
   frustrations. In this sense, this paper presents a dynamic difficulty
   adjustment mechanism for MOBA games. The main idea is to create a
   computer controlled opponent that adapts dynamically to the player
   performance, trying to offer to the player a better game experience.
   This is done by evaluating the performance of the player using a metric
   based on some game features and switching the difficulty of the
   opponent's artificial intelligence behavior accordingly. Quantitative
   and qualitative experiments were performed and the results showed that
   the system is capable of adapting dynamically to the opponent's skills.
   In spite of that, the qualitative experiments with users showed that the
   player's expertise has a greater influence on the perception of the
   difficulty level and dynamic adaptation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   method of coalition formation with stochastic mechanism is proposed to
   reduce excessive competitions. An artificial intelligent algorithm is
   proposed to compensate for the difference between the expected and

Abstract = {{In the current era of computer and communication rapid development,

   represents the levels of the sensor and sink nodes. The three-layer
   model represents the levels of the sensor, sink and base station. The
   models are elaborated and examined through a set of experiments. A
   supervised learning algorithm is introduced to be used in the sensor
   node layer and an unsupervised learning algorithm is introduced to be
   used in the other layers. The learning algorithms used only 10\% of the

Abstract = {{Data warehouse is an essential component of almost every modern
   enterprise information system. It stores huge amount of
   subject-oriented, time-stamped, non-volatile and integrated data. It is
   highly required of the system to respond to complex online analytical
   queries posed against its data warehouse in seconds for efficient
   decision making. Optimization of online analytical query processing
   (OLAP) could substantially minimize delays in query response time.
   Materialized view is an efficient and effective OLAP query optimization
   technique to minimize query response time. Selecting a set of such
   appropriate views for materialization is referred to as view selection,
   which is a nontrivial task. In this regard, an Artificial Bee Colony
   (ABC) based view selection algorithm (ABCVSA), which has been adapted by
   incorporating N-point and GBFS based N-point random insertion
   operations, to select Top-K views from a multidimensional lattice is
   proposed. Experimental results show that ABCVSA performs better than the
   most fundamental view selection algorithm HRUA. Thus, the views selected
   using ABCVSA on materialization would reduce the query response time of
   OLAP queries and thereby aid analysts in arriving at strategic business
   decisions in an effective manner.}},

Abstract = {{The tourism sector in the province of Teruel (Aragon, Spain) is
   increasing rapidly. Although the number of domestic and foreign tourists
   is continuously growing, there are some tourist attractions spread over
   a wide geographical area, which are only visited by a few people at
   specific times of the year. Additionally, having human tourist guides
   everywhere and speaking different languages is unfeasible. An integrated
   solution based on smart and interactive Embodied Conversational Agents
   (ECAs) tourist guides combined with ontologies would overcome this
   problem.
   This paper presents a smart tourist information points approach which
   gathers tourism information about Teruel, structured according to a
   novel lightweight ontology built on OWL (Ontology Web Language), known
   as TITERIA (Touristic Information of TEruel for Intelligent Agents). Our
   proposal, which combines TITERIA with the Maxine platform, is capable of
   responding appropriately to the users thanks to its Artificial
   Intelligence Modeling Language (AIML) database and the AI techniques
   added to Maxine. Preliminary results indicate that our prototype is able
   to inform users about interesting topics, as well as to propose other
   related information, allowing them to acquire a complete information
   about any issue. Furthermore, users can directly talk with an artificial
   actor making communication much more natural and closer.}},

Abstract = {{The advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) for adaptive cruise control
   and collision avoidance is strongly dependent upon the robust image
   recognition technology such as lane detection, vehicle/pedestrian
   detection, and traffic sign recognition. However, the conventional ADAS
   cannot realize more advanced collision evasion in real environments due
   to the absence of intelligent vehicle/pedestrian behavior analysis.
   Moreover, accurate distance estimation is essential in ADAS applications
   and semiglobal matching (SGM) is most widely adopted for high accuracy,
   but its system-on-chip (SoC) implementation is difficult due to the
   massive external memory bandwidth. In this paper, an ADAS SoC with
   behavior analysis with Artificial Intelligence functions and hardware
   implementation of SGM is proposed. The proposed SoC has dual-mode
   operations of highperformance operation for intelligent ADAS with
   real-time SGM in D-Mode (d-mode) and ultralow-power operation for black
   box system in parking-mode. It features: 1) task-level pipelined SGM
   processor to reduce external memory bandwidth by 85.8\%; 2)
   region-of-interest generation processor to reduce 86.2\% of computation;
   3) mixed-mode intention prediction engine for dualmode intelligence; and
   4) dynamic voltage and frequency scaling control to save 36.2\% of power
   in d-mode. The proposed ADAS processor achieves 862 GOPS/W energy
   efficiency and 31.4GOPS/ mm(2) area efficiency, which are 1.53x and
   1.75x improvements than the state of the art, with 30 frames/s

Abstract = {{The division of internal structures and external space of geographical
   entities is foundation of spatial analysis, query and reasoning. Most
   current division methods are crisp, and inconsistent with human
   cognitive habits. Usually existing geographic information systems(GISs)
   analyze spatial data directly by certain spatial analysis methods and
   then use natural language or words to explain analysis results, so the
   encoding process is absence but it is necessary in intelligent GIS
   (IGIS). Fuzzy geographical entities and phenomena occur throughout the
   real world, and these semantics of words related spatial locations and
   relations usually involve uncertainties. First, the geographical
   perceptual computing (GPC) model based on CWW is proposed and it
   includes four modules: input, geo-encoder, geographical CWW engine and
   geo-decoder. Then, the trapezoidal fuzzy set is adopted to represent
   spatial words. A fine fuzzy spatial partitioning model of line objects
   based on CWW is proposed. The interior of a line object is divided into
   several parts according to fuzzy logic and human cognitive habits. The
   exterior of a line entity is then divided into several parts by
   combining direction relation and distance relation models with fuzzy
   logic methods. This model provides a full natural language description
   of the interior and exterior of crisp or fuzzy line entities and
   consistent with human cognitive habits. An application case of this
   model is provided in the last and proves the superiority of this model.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT \& FUZZY SYSTEMS}},

Pages = {{2549-2562}},
Abstract = {{Rough set characterizes an uncertain set with two crisp boundaries,
   i.e., lower and upper-approximation sets, and it has successfully been
   applied into artificial intelligence fields. However, there is little
   discuss on how to establish a crisp set as approximation set of a target
   set instead of only giving out two boundary lines. Although many
   uncertain decision rules can be acquired from the information system
   based on lower-approximation set by keeping the positive region
   unchanged, the accuracy of these rules depends on the similarity between
   a target set and its lower-approximation set. In order to solve this
   problem, an approximation set model of rough set was proposed and
   applied into attribute reduction or uncertain image segmentation
   successfully in our previous research. In this paper, a kind of fuzzy
   similarity between a target set and its approximation set is presented
   based on Euclidean distance instead of the similarity based on
   cardinality of a finite set. Then many good properties of
   0.5-approximation set of a rough set are presented, and the conclusion
   that 0.5-appoximation set is the best approximation set of a rough set
   in all definable sets is successfully proved with Euclidean similarity
   between two fuzzy sets. Finally, the change laws of fuzzy similarity
   between a target set and its 0.5-approximation set in different
   granularity spaces is analyzed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a cooperative framework for fireworks algorithm
   (CoFFWA). A detailed analysis of existing fireworks algorithm (FWA) and
   its recently developed variants has revealed that (i) the current
   selection strategy has the drawback that the contribution of the
   firework with the best fitness (denoted as core firework) overwhelms the
   contributions of all other fireworks (non-core fireworks) in the
   explosion operator, (ii) the Gaussian mutation operator is not as
   effective as it is designed to be. To overcome these limitations, the
   CoFFWA is proposed, which significantly improves the exploitation
   capability by using an independent selection method and also increases
   the exploration capability by incorporating a crowdness-avoiding
   cooperative strategy among the fireworks. Experimental results on the
   CEC2013 benchmark functions indicate that CoFFWA outperforms the
   state-of-the-art FWA variants, artificial bee colony, differential
   evolution, and the standard particle swarm optimization
   SPSO2007/SPSO2011 in terms of convergence performance.}},

Abstract = {{To make further improvement in the diagnosis accuracy and efficiency, a
   mixed-domain state features data based hybrid fault diagnosis approach,
   which systematically blends both the statistical analysis approach and
   the artificial intelligence technology, is proposed in this work for
   rolling element bearings. For simplifying the fault diagnosis problems,
   the execution of the proposed method is divided into three steps, i.e.,
   fault preliminary detection, fault type recognition and fault degree
   identification. In the first step, a preliminary judgment about the
   health status of the equipment can be evaluated by the statistical
   analysis method based on the permutation entropy theory. If fault
   exists, the following two processes based on the artificial intelligence
   approach are performed to further recognize the fault type and then
   identify the fault degree. For the two subsequent steps, mixed-domain
   state features containing time domain, frequency-domain and multi-scale
   features are extracted to represent the fault peculiarity under
   different working conditions. As a powerful time-frequency analysis
   method, the fast EEMD method was employed to obtain multi-scale
   features. Furthermore, due to the information redundancy and the
   submergence of original feature space, a novel manifold learning method
   (modified LGPCA) is introduced to realize the low-dimensional
   representations for high-dimensional feature space. Finally, two cases
   with 12 working conditions respectively have been employed to evaluate
   the performance of the proposed method, where vibration signals were
   measured from an experimental bench of rolling element bearing. The
   analysis results showed the effectiveness and the superiority of the
   proposed method of which the diagnosis thought is more suitable for
   practical application. (C) 2016 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Community structure is important for us to understand the functions and

   Bee Colony (HABC) algorithm based on swarm intelligence is proposed for

   initialization stage, the nectar sources with simple community structure

Title = {{Uncertain UAV ISR mission planning problem with multiple correlated

Pages = {{321-335}},
Abstract = {{Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is very useful for information gathering
   in Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission. On the
   basis of uncertainty theory, the main purpose of this paper is to study
   a new kind of UAV ISR mission planning problem involving multiple
   objectives under uncertain environment. In particular, the mission
   planning objectives are influenced by the same uncertain factors
   simultaneously, that is to say, they are correlated or dependent with
   each other. In this case, the traditional multiobjective approach cannot
   guarantee the uncertain nature and take into account the dependence
   among uncertain objectives in the UAV ISR mission planning problem. In
   order to overcome the disadvantage in traditional approach, a new
   solution approach is introduced for obtaining the PE Pareto efficient
   routes for it, which involves transforming the original ISR mission
   planning problem into a single objective uncertain programming problem.
   Two specific compromise models are proposed using this new solution
   approach respectively, whose validity is proved theoretically. Finally,
   an application case study with 13 ISR targets is provided and solved.
   The results show that the proposed model and solution approach have
   excellent consistency and efficiency in solving the uncertain UAV ISR
   mission planning problem presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Development of accurate systems to assess academic research performance
   is an essential topic in national science agendas around the world.
   Providing quantitative elements such as scientometric rankings and
   indicators have contributed to measure prestige and excellence of
   universities, but more sophisticated computational tools are seldom
   exploited. We compare the evolution of Mexican scientific production in
   Scopus and the Web of Science as well as Mexico's scientific
   productivity in relation to the growth of the National Researchers
   System of Mexico is analyzed. As a main analysis tool we introduce an
   artificial intelligence procedure based on self-organizing neural
   networks. The neural network technique proves to be a worthy
   scientometric data mining and visualization tool which automatically
   carries out multiparametric scientometric characterizations of the
   production profiles of the 50 most productive Mexican Higher Education
   Institutions (in Scopus database). With this procedure we automatically
   identify and visually depict clusters of institutions that share similar
   bibliometric profiles in bidimensional maps. Four perspectives were
   represented in scientometric maps: productivity, impact, expected
   visibility and excellence. Since each cluster of institutions represents
   a bibliometric pattern of institutional performance, the neural network
   helps locate various bibliometric profiles of academic production, and
   the identification of groups of institutions which have similar patterns
   of performance. Also, scientometric maps allow for the identification of
   atypical behaviors (outliers) which are difficult to identify with
   classical tools, since they outstand not because of a disparate value in
   just one variable, but due to an uncommon combination of a set of
   indicators values.}},

Abstract = {{Emotions can affect human's performance in a considerable manner. These
   emotions can be articulated in many ways such as text, speech, facial
   expressions, gestures and postures. Humans in effect of their emotions,
   have ability to perform surprising tasks under their emotional state. In
   recent years, interactive cognitive agents are being utilized in
   industrial and non-industrial organizations to interact with persons
   inside or outside the organization. Existing agents are intelligent
   enough to communicate like humans by expressing their emotions and
   recognizing emotions of other person. One of the main limitation of
   existing interactive agents is that they can only recognize emotions
   based on predefined keywords or semantics instead of analyzing the
   context in which those keywords were used. The focus of this paper is to
   study context based emotions and to present a model, which can analyze
   the context and generate emotion accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{We propose to use a supervised machine learning technique to track the
   location of a mobile agent in real time. Hidden Markov Models are used
   to build artificial intelligence that estimates the unknown position of
   a mobile target moving in a defined environment. This narrow artificial
   intelligence performs two distinct tasks. First, it provides real-time
   estimation of the mobile agent's position using the forward algorithm.
   Second, it uses the Baum-Welch algorithm as a statistical learning tool
   to gain knowledge of the mobile target. Finally, an experimental
   environment is proposed, namely, a video game that we use to test our
   artificial intelligence. We present statistical and graphical results to
   illustrate the efficiency of our method.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the impressive amount of financial resources recently invested
   in carrying out large-scale brain simulations, it is controversial what
   the pay-offs are of pursuing this project. One idea is that from
   designing, building, and running a large-scale neural simulation,
   scientists acquire knowledge about the computational performance of the
   simulating system, rather than about the neurobiological system
   represented in the simulation. It has been claimed that this knowledge
   may usher in a new era of neuromorphic, cognitive computing systems.
   This study elucidates this claim and argues that the main challenge this
   era is facing is not the lack of biological realism. The challenge lies
   in identifying general neurocomputational principles for the design of
   artificial systems, which could display the robust flexibility

Volume = {{29}},

Pages = {{371-396}},
Abstract = {{Artificial general intelligence is a field of research aiming to distil
   the principles of intelligence that operate independently of a specific
   problem domain and utilise these principles in order to synthesise
   systems capable of performing any intellectual task a human being is
   capable of and beyond. While ``narrow{''} artificial intelligence which
   focuses on solving specific problems such as speech recognition, text
   comprehension, visual pattern recognition and robotic motion has shown
   impressive breakthroughs lately, understanding general intelligence
   remains elusive. We propose a paradigm shift from intelligence perceived
   as a competence of individual agents defined in relation to an a priori
   given problem domain or a goal, to intelligence perceived as a formative
   process of self-organisation. We call this process open-ended
   intelligence. Starting with a brief introduction of the current
   conceptual approach, we expose a number of serious limitations that are
   traced back to the ontological roots of the concept of intelligence.
   Open-ended intelligence is then developed as an abstraction of the
   process of human cognitive development, so its application can be
   extended to general agents and systems. We introduce and discuss three
   facets of the idea: the philosophical concept of individuation,
   sense-making and the individuation of general cognitive agents. We
   further show how open-ended intelligence can be framed in terms of a
   distributed, self-organising network of interacting elements and how

Abstract = {{An artificial superintelligence (ASI) is an artificial intelligence that
   is significantly more intelligent than humans in all respects. Whilst
   ASI does not currently exist, some scholars propose that it could be
   created sometime in the future, and furthermore that its creation could
   cause a severe global catastrophe, possibly even resulting in human
   extinction. Given the high stakes, it is important to analyze ASI risk
   and factor the risk into decisions related to ASI research and
   development. This paper presents a graphical model of major pathways to
   ASI catastrophe, focusing on ASI created via recursive self-improvement.
   The model uses the established risk and decision analysis modelling
   paradigms of fault trees and influence diagrams in order to depict
   combinations of events and conditions that could lead to AI catastrophe,
   as well as intervention options that could decrease risks. The events
   and conditions include select aspects of the ASI itself as well as the
   human process of ASI research, development and management. Model
   structure is derived from published literature on ASI risk. The model
   offers a foundation for rigorous quantitative evaluation and
   decision-making on the long-term risk of ASI catastrophe.}},

   approach, called General Policy Function Approximation, that provides
   good solutions to the electricity portfolio problem in a limited

Title = {{Recent automatic text summarization techniques: a survey}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-66}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{As information is available in abundance for every topic on internet,
   condensing the important information in the form of summary would
   benefit a number of users. Hence, there is growing interest among the
   research community for developing new approaches to automatically
   summarize the text. Automatic text summarization system generates a
   summary, i.e. short length text that includes all the important
   information of the document. Since the advent of text summarization in
   1950s, researchers have been trying to improve techniques for generating
   summaries so that machine generated summary matches with the human made
   summary. Summary can be generated through extractive as well as
   abstractive methods. Abstractive methods are highly complex as they need
   extensive natural language processing. Therefore, research community is
   focusing more on extractive summaries, trying to achieve more coherent
   and meaningful summaries. During a decade, several extractive approaches
   have been developed for automatic summary generation that implements a
   number of machine learning and optimization techniques. This paper
   presents a comprehensive survey of recent text summarization extractive
   approaches developed in the last decade. Their needs are identified and
   their advantages and disadvantages are listed in a comparative manner. A
   few abstractive and multilingual text summarization approaches are also
   covered. Summary evaluation is another challenging issue in this
   research field. Therefore, intrinsic as well as extrinsic both the
   methods of summary evaluation are described in detail along with text
   summarization evaluation conferences and workshops. Furthermore,
   evaluation results of extractive summarization approaches are presented
   on some shared DUC datasets. Finally this paper concludes with the
   discussion of useful future directions that can help researchers to
   identify areas where further research is needed.}},

Abstract = {{For financial time series, the generation of error bars on the point of
   prediction is important in order to estimate the corresponding risk. In
   recent years, optimization techniques-driven artificial intelligence has
   been used to make time series approaches more systematic and improve
   forecasting performance. This paper presents a local linear radial basis
   functional neural network (LLRBFNN) model for classifying finance data
   from Yahoo Inc. The LLRBFNN model is learned by using the hybrid
   technique of backpropagation and recursive least square algorithm. The
   LLRBFNN model uses a local linear model in between the hidden layer and
   the output layer in contrast to the weights connected from hidden layer
   to output layer in typical neural network models. The obtained
   prediction result is compared with multilayer perceptron and radial
   basis functional neural network with the parameters being trained by
   gradient descent learning method. The proposed technique provides a
   lower mean squared error and thus can be considered as superior to other
   models. The technique is also tested on linear data, i.e., diabetic
   data, to confirm the validity of the result obtained from the
   experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Damage due to moisture in polymer modified asphalt pavements has been
   investigated for several decades; yet, the exact and mathematical causes
   of moisture are not precisely known. Nanoscale experiment has been
   conducted in this study with an atomic force microscopy (AFM) to
   determine these effects in terms of adhesive and cohesive forces. A base
   asphalt binder and one polymer styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) were
   utilized to modify asphalt binders, which was used to prepare sample for
   testing on glass substrates under AFM. The asphalt samples were
   conditioned under wet and dry conditions. Current study formulates an
   artificial intelligence rule which predicts the moisture damage relation
   in lime and SBS modified asphalts. Base asphalt binders have shown
   larger adhesion/cohesion values compared to the polymer modified asphalt
   samples under dry conditions. However, this trend is opposite under wet
   conditions. Base binders are more susceptible to moisture damage than
   the polymer modified asphalt binders. ANFIS model (as compared to MLP
   and SVM) was found to be very promising in these points. The mean
   relative error was very low 0.02 and 0.03, respectively, for projected
   and observed data, which also showed the steady performance of the
   model. Statistical analysis was also performed for dry sample by
   executing of the three neural network models and found MLP's performance
   was very good to other two models.}},

Journal = {{SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{369-389}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Ontologies have been increasingly used over the past few decades in a
   wide range of application domains spanning both academic and industrial
   communities. As ontologies are the cornerstone of the Semantic Web, the
   technologies developed in this context, including ontology languages,
   specialized databases and query languages, have become widely used.
   However, the expressiveness of the proposed ontology languages does not
   always cover the needs of specific domains. For instance, engineering is
   a domain for which the LIAS laboratory has proposed dedicated solutions
   with a worldwide recognition. The underlying assumptions made in the
   context of the Semantic Web, an open and distributed environment, do not
   apply to the controlled environments of our projects where the
   correctness and completeness of modeling can be guaranteed to a certain
   degree. As a consequence, we have developed over the last decades a
   specialized standard ontology language named PLIB associated with the
   OntoDB/OntoQL platform to manage ontological engineering data within a
   database. The goal of this paper is threefold: (1) to share our
   experience in manipulating ontologies in the engineering domain by
   describing their specificities and constraints; (2) to define a
   comprehensive classification of ontologies with respect to three main
   research communities: Artificial Intelligence, Databases and Natural
   Language Processing and (3) to present a persistent solution, called
   OntoDB, for managing extremely large semantic data sets associated with
   an ontological query language, called OntoQL. These objectives are
   illustrated by several examples that show the effectiveness and interest
   of our propositions in several industrial projects in different domains
   including vehicle manufacturing and CO2 storage.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to build an artificial intelligence (AI)-based inference
   model to predict the coefficient of performance (COP) for refrigeration
   equipment under various R404A refrigerant conditions. The proposed
   model, the evolutionary multivariate adaptive regression splines
   (EMARS), is a hybrid of the multivariate adaptive regression splines
   (MARS) and the artificial bee colony (ABC). In the EMARS, the MARS
   primarily addresses the learning and curve fitting and the ABC carries
   out optimization to determine the fittest parameter settings with
   minimal prediction error. A tenfold cross-validation method was used to
   compare the performance of the EMARS against four other AI techniques,
   including the back-propagation neural network, classification and
   regression tree, genetic programming, and support vector machine. An
   analysis of comparison results supports EMARS as the best model for
   predicting the COP, with an MAPE value 1\%. In addition to performing
   significantly better than the four benchmark models, EMARS is unique in
   being able to: operate automatically without human intervention or
   domain knowledge; explore the approximate function of the input-output
   relationship; and identify the relative importance of various factors of
   influence automatically.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, new digital technologies have been introduced into our
   business and social environments, causing a major change that is
   recognized as the digital transformation. To better adapt to this trend,
   in 2015 Fujitsu launched FUJITSU Digital Business Platform MetaArc
   (hereafter, MetaArc), designed to integrate the latest information and
   communications technologies (ICTs) such as cloud computing, mobile
   technology, big data (analytics), the Internet of Things (IoT), and
   artificial intelligence (Al). MetaArc is a platform that realizes a
   seamless collaboration between two kinds of systems-those that create
   new innovations through connecting people and the physical environment
   (Systems of Engagement, or SoE) and those that enhance the efficiency of
   enterprise systems (Systems of Record, or SoR). Together, they make it
   possible to respond to changes in the business environment quickly and
   flexibly. MetaArc also offers a series of products useful for making a
   business grow. This paper introduces FUJITSU Cloud Service K5, the core
   cloud platform for MetaArc. It then outlines the platform's various
   component services and products and describes our cloud-centered
   strategies and efforts to maximize the value provided to our customers.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for information and communications technology (ICT) has grown
   remarkably in recent years, with customers wanting to leverage it to
   transform their on-site work and create new business opportunities
   through innovations. In this climate, the deployment of artificial
   intelligence (Al) is attracting special interest. In the Fujitsu Group,
   Fujitsu Laboratories has been the hub of the research and development of
   Al since the 1980s, aiming to realize its practical application. Today,
   our knowledge and expertise in Al are integrated into a structured
   system Human Centric Al Zinrai (hereafter, Zinrai). Based on Fujitsu's
   knowledge and know-how gained through cutting-edge research, Zinrai
   comprises the component technologies of sensing and recognition,
   knowledge processing, and decision-making and support, together with
   learning technologies that allow these features to be enhanced and grow.
   Fujitsu takes a unique approach to Al because these technologies are
   organically integrated to facilitate an ICT environment that helps
   enrich people's lives and society. This paper presents contextual
   accounts of Al development at Fujitsu, and describes innovative
   technologies that represent the four areas of technology within Zinrai:

Abstract = {{Analyzing and formalizing the intricate mechanisms of music is a very
   challenging goal for Artificial Intelligence. Dealing with real audio
   recordings requires the ability to handle both uncertainty and complex
   relational structure at multiple levels of representation. Until now,
   these two aspects have been generally treated separately, probability
   being the standard way to represent uncertainty in knowledge, while
   logical representation being the standard way to represent knowledge and
   complex relational information. Several approaches attempting a
   unification of logic and probability have recently been proposed. In
   particular, Markov logic networks (MLNs), which combine first-order
   logic and probabilistic graphical models, have attracted increasing
   attention in recent years in many domains. This paper introduces MLNs as
   a highly flexible and expressive formalism for the analysis of music
   that encompasses most of the commonly used probabilistic and
   logic-basedmodels. We first review and discuss existing approaches for
   music analysis. We then introduce MLNs in the context of music signal
   processing by providing a deep understanding of how they specifically
   relate to traditional models, specifically hidden Markov models and
   conditional random fields. We then present a detailed application of
   MLNs for tonal harmony music analysis that illustrates the potential of
   this framework for music processing.}},

Abstract = {{In today's time-sensitive markets, effective storage policies are widely
   accepted as a means for improving the efficiency of order picking. As a
   result of customization, the variety of products handled by a warehouse
   has increased, making storage location assignment problems more
   complicated. Different approaches have been proposed by researchers for
   improving storage assignment and order picking. However, many industrial
   practitioners find it difficult to adopt such approaches due to
   complexity and high associated costs. In particular, small and medium
   enterprises (SMEs), that generally, lack resources and who have staff
   members with weak artificial intelligence backgrounds, still rely on
   experience when assigning storage locations for diverse products. In
   these circumstances, the quality of decision making cannot be
   guaranteed. In view of this, an intelligent system which can be easily
   adopted by SMEs is designed to improve storage location assignment
   problems. The proposed system, an RFID-based storage assignment system
   (RFID-SAS), is a rule-based system incorporating radio frequency
   identification (RFID) provides decision support for storage assignment
   in a warehouse. Unlike many existing situations, RFID tags are attached
   to products at the item level instead of at the pallet level. As the
   knowledge embedded in the system is represented in the form of rules,
   evaluation is important and is outlined in this paper. The effectiveness
   of the system is verified by means of a case study in which the system
   is implemented in a typical SME specializing in machinery manufacturing.
   The results illustrate that RFID-SAS can enhance the efficiency of order
   picking in a warehouse.}},

Title = {{An artificial intelligence model to estimate the fat addition ratio for
   the mixing process in the animal feed industry}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{219-228}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In animal feed pellets, the fat content is obtained either from the feed
   ingredients or is directly added during processing. Additional fat is
   required when the fat level in the feed ingredients is less than the
   desired level. This fat can be added either during the mixing process or
   after the pelleting process. However, adding fat at different time leads
   to different results. The addition of an increasing amount of fat during
   the mixing process decreases the pellet durability but enhances the
   pellet production rate. To avoid a reduction in the pellet durability,
   limiting the inclusion of fats in the mixer is suggested. The use of
   suitable fat addition ratios during mixing and after pelleting can
   improve the pellet quality and the production capability. Many factors
   significantly affect the decision of how much fat to add, such as the
   fiber inclusion content in the feed formulation, pellet die size,
   required feed durability, total required fat, and required additional
   fat. Due to frequent changes in the feed mix, anticipating the suitable
   amount of fat addition during the mixing process becomes a cumbersome
   task for a mill. In this paper, a model for estimating the amount of fat
   required in the mixer for each feed formulation is proposed. The model
   is based on the local linear map (LLM) and the back-propagation neural
   network (BPNN) methods. The LLM is used to identify which feed
   formulations require the addition of fat both during mixing and after
   pelleting, whereas the BPNN is employed for estimating the proper total
   fat required in the mixer, and the ratio of fat to add during the mixing
   process is subsequently estimated by subtracting the fat in the raw
   material from the total fat required in the mixer. The model is
   developed using data from one the largest feed mills in Thailand. The
   proposed model provides an accurate prediction and is practical for
   implementation in the mill that was studied.}},

Abstract = {{Energy-efficient clustering protocols are much sought specially for
   low-power, multi-functional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). With the
   application of Computational Intelligence (CI) based approaches, various
   metaheuristics have been developed for energy-efficient clustering in
   WSNs. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is one such metaheuristic which arose
   much interest over other population-based metaheuristics for solving
   optimization problems in WSNs due to its ease of implementation and
   adaptive nature. However, its solution search equation, which is poor at
   exploitation process, contributes to its insufficiency. Thus, we present
   an improved Artificial Bee Colony (iABC) metaheuristic with an improved
   solution search equation to improve its exploitation capabilities.
   Additionally, in order to increase the global convergence of the
   proposed metaheuristic, an improved population sampling technique is
   introduced through Student's-t distribution. The proposed metaheuristic
   maintains a good balance between exploration and exploitation search
   abilities with least memory requirements, moreover the use of first of
   its kind compact Student's-t distribution makes it suitable for limited
   hardware requirements of WSNs. Further, an energy efficient clustering
   protocol BeeCluster based on iABC metaheuristic is introduced, which
   inherits the capabilities of the proposed metaheuristic to obtain
   optimal cluster heads (CHs) and improves energy-efficiency in WSNs.
   Simulation results show that the proposed clustering protocol
   outperforms other well known protocols on the basis of packet delivery,
   throughput, energy consumption, network lifetime and latency as
   performance metric.}},

Abstract = {{Lifted inference aims at answering queries from statistical relational
   models by reasoning on populations of individuals as a whole instead of
   considering each individual singularly. Since the initial proposal by
   David Poole in 2003, many lifted inference techniques have appeared, by
   lifting different algorithms or using approximation involving different
   kinds of models, including parfactor graphs and Markov Logic Networks.
   Very recently lifted inference was applied to Probabilistic Logic
   Programming (PLP) under the distribution semantics, with proposals such
   as L P-2 and Weighted First-Order Model Counting (WFOMC). Moreover,
   techniques for dealing with aggregation parfactors can be directly
   applied to PLP. In this paper we survey these approaches and present an
   experimental comparison on five models. The results show that WFOMC
   outperforms the other approaches, being able to exploit more symmetries.

   from papers is collated and classified based on application domain,
   optimisation objective functions, model formulations and optimisation
   methods. This classification enables the identification of key trends
   within the research. The most common objective functions applied within
   studies are time and throughput. In addition, what-if scenario analysis
   is identified as the most common optimisation method. An increase in the
   use of hybrid methods for simulation modelling and growing application
   of Artificial Intelligence methods for multi-objective optimisation of
   DES models has been noted. These growing trends provide a variety of
   interesting areas for progress in future research.}},

Abstract = {{With the number of deaths due to liver diseases increasing steadily in
   recent years, early detection and treatment of these diseases has been
   one of the most active research fields using computational intelligence
   techniques. In this paper, we propose a more realistic single-neuron
   model with synaptic nonlinearities in a dendritic tree for liver
   disorder diagnosis. The computation on the neuron is performed as a
   combination of dimensional reduction and nonlinearity, which has a
   neuron-pruning function that can remove useless synapses and dendrites
   during learning, forming a distinct synaptic and dendritic morphology.
   The nonlinear interactions in a dendrite tree are expressed using the
   Boolean logic AND (conjunction), OR (disjunction), and NOT (negation),
   which can be easily implemented in hardware. Furthermore, an error
   backpropagation (BP) algorithm is used to train the neuron model, and
   the performance is compared with a traditional BP neural network in
   terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. We use the BUPA liver
   disorder datasets obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to
   verify the proposed method. Simulation results show promise for the use
   of this single-neuron model as an effective pattern classification
   method in liver disorder diagnostics. (c) 2016 Institute of Electrical

Abstract = {{We propose an efficient bio-inspired algorithm for design of optimal
   supply chain networks in a competitive oligopolymarkets. The firms
   compete in manufacture, storage and distribution of a product to several
   markets. Each firm aims at maximisation of its own profit by optimising
   the design capacity and product flow in the supply chain. We model the
   supply chain network as a multi-layer graph of manufacturing nodes,
   distribution nodes and storage centres. To optimise the network, we
   adopt the mechanisms of a foraging behaviour of slime mould Physarum
   polycephalym. First, we extend the original Physarum model to deal with
   networks with multiple sources and sinks. Second, we develop a novel
   method to solve the user equilibrium (UE) problem by exploiting the
   adaptivity of the Physarum model: we update the link costs according to
   the product flow. Third, we refer to an equivalent transformation
   between system optimum problem and UE problem to determine the optimal
   product flows and design capacities of a supply chain. At last, we
   present an approach to update the amount of product supplied by each
   firm. By comparing our solutions with Nagurney's on several numerical
   examples, we demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed

Journal = {{SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{70}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{As simulation systems get more and more complex, the study of
   multi-resolution modeling (MRM) remains an exciting and fertile area of
   research. Contrasting its abundant successful use cases, a rigorous
   mathematical foundation is still lacking in MRM. In this paper, we
   propose a quotient space based multi-resolution modeling (QMRM) theory
   based on granular computing in artificial intelligence and on
   discrete-event system specification (DEVS) in modeling and simulation.
   Based on quotient sets, resolution, multi-resolution modeling and other
   related concepts are defined and a general concept framework is
   constructed. Based on the concepts of quotient set and natural
   projection, several MRM principles are derived. The internal consistency
   principle guarantees consistency among different perspectives of an
   atomic model, whereas the external consistency principle guarantees that
   different components in a coupled model are consistent. The
   false-preserving principle indicates that if a construction relation or
   state transformation relation of a component does not exist in a low
   resolution model, then the corresponding relations should not exist in
   its high resolution model. The true-preserving principle tells us that a
   high resolution model can be simplified by choosing the proper low
   resolution model. QMRM is not only a formal specification, but also a
   fundamental framework to understand MRM concepts, a guiding ideology to
   design specific MRM methods, and a modeling methodology to develop MRM
   systems. QMRM is created from a general simulation perspective, not
   limited by any specific application or problem domain aspects. The
   results of this paper can serve as a starting point for further study of
   multi-resolution problems in different domains. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a methodology for compression of electrical power
   signals from waveform records in electric systems, using genetic
   algorithm (GA) and artificial neural network (ANN). The genetic
   algorithm is used to select and preserve the points that better
   characterize the waveform contours; and the artificial neural network is
   used in the compression of other points as well as on the signal
   reconstruction process. Thus, the data resulting from the proposed
   methodology are formed by a part of the original signal and by a
   compressed complementary part in the form of synaptic weights. The
   proposed methodology selects and preserves a percentage of the original
   signal samples, which are aspects not explored in the literature. The
   method was tested using field data obtained from an oscillographic
   recorder installed in a 230 kV electrical power system. The results
   presented compression rates ranging from 8.59:1.00 to 24.16:1.00 for
   preservation rates ranging from 2.5\% to 10\%, respectively. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{To operate an in-orbit spacecraft, the spacecraft status has to be
   monitored autonomously by collecting and analysing real-time data, and
   then detecting abnormities and malfunctions of system components. To
   develop an information system for spacecraft state detection, we
   investigate the feasibility of using ontology-based artificial
   intelligence in the system development. We propose a new modelling
   technique based on the semantic web, agent, scenarios and ontologies
   model. In modelling, the subjects of astronautics fields are classified,
   corresponding agents and scenarios are defined, and they are connected
   by the semantic web to analyse data and detect failures. We introduce
   the modelling methodologies and the resulted framework of the status
   detection information system in this paper. We discuss system components
   as well as their interactions in details. The system has been prototyped
   and tested to illustrate its feasibility and effectiveness. The proposed
   modelling technique is generic which can be extended and applied to the
   system development of other large-scale and complex information systems.}},

Abstract = {{In cognitive radio (CR) systems, reasonable power allocation can
   increase transmission rate of CR users or secondary users (SUs) as much
   as possible and at the same time insure normal communication among

   scheme for the OFDM-based CR system with one SU influenced by multiple

   artificial fish swarm (IAFS) algorithm in combination with the advantage
   of conventional artificial fish swarm (ASF) algorithm and particle swarm
   optimisation (PSO) algorithm. In performance comparison of IAFS
   algorithm with other intelligent algorithms by simulations, the
   superiority of the IAFS algorithm is illustrated; this superiority
   results in better performance of our proposed scheme than that of the
   power allocation algorithms proposed by the previous studies in the same
   scenario. Furthermore, our proposed scheme can obtain higher

Abstract = {{An autonomous agent must know where it is, which objects are in the
   nearby surrounding area and where it can find already seen, far away
   objects. On the basis of the existing cognitive architecture Simulation
   of Mental Apparatus and Applications (SiMA) at the Institute of Computer
   Technology (ICT) we show, how cognitive architectures can get extended
   by location awareness and navigation. This paper deals with the problem
   of self-localization and path finding. Therefore, landmarks, locations
   and regions will be used. Actions lead the agent from one location to
   another. Locations are hierarchically grouped together to regions. The
   functionality was implemented exemplary in a multiagent simulation using
   simplified scenarios. The results confirm the prospects. Now we can
   start to introduce the functionality in our full featured main

Abstract = {{The need for a comparison between two Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
   plays a crucial role in various pattern recognition tasks and is
   involved as a key components in many expert and artificial intelligence
   (AI) systems dealing with real-life problems. As those system often
   operate on large data-sets and use high dimensional features, it is
   crucial for their recognition component to be computationally efficient
   in addition to its good recognition accuracy. In this work we deliver
   the novel similarity measure between GMMs, by LPP-like projecting the
   components of a particular GMM, from the high dimensional original
   parameter space, to a much lower dimensional space. Thus, finding the
   distance between two GMMs in the original space is reduced to finding
   the distance between sets of lower dimensional Euclidian vectors,
   pondered by corresponding weights. By doing so, we manage to obtain much
   better trade-off between the recognition accuracy and the computational
   complexity, in comparison to the measures between GMMs utilizing
   distances between Gaussian components evaluated in the original
   parameter space. Thus, the GMM measure that we propose is suitable for
   applications in AI systems that use GMMs in their recognition tasks and
   operate on large data sets, as the required number of overall Gaussian
   components involved in such systems is always large. We evaluate the
   proposed GMM measure on artificial, as well as real-world experimental
   data obtaining a much better trade-off between recognition accuracy and
   the computational complexity, in comparison to all baseline GMM
   similarity measures tested. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Time series forecasting is an important research field in machine
   learning. Since the literature shows several techniques for the solution
   of this problem, combining outputs of different models is a simple and
   robust strategy. However, even when using combiners, the experimenter
   may face the following dilemma: which technique should one use to
   combine the individual predictors? Inspired by classification and
   pattern recognition algorithms, this work presents a dynamic selection
   method of forecast combiners. In the dynamic selection, each test
   pattern is submitted to a certain combiner according to a nearest
   neighbor rule. The proposed method was used to forecast eight time
   series with chaotic behavior in short and long term. In general, the
   dynamic selection presented satisfactory results for all datasets. (C)

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},

Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{87-99}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The emergence of Omni-channel has affected the practical design of the
   supply chain network (SCN) with the purpose of providing better products
   and services for customers. In contrast to the conventional SCN, a new
   strategic model for designing SCN with multiple distribution channels
   (MDCSCN) is introduced in this research. The MDCSCN model benefits
   customers by providing direct products and services from available
   facilities instead of the conventional flow of products and services.
   Sustainable objectives, i.e., reducing economic cost, enlarging customer
   coverage and weakening environmental influences, are involved in
   designing the MDCSN. A modified multi-objective artificial bee colony
   (MOABC) algorithm is introduced to solve the MDCSCN model, which
   integrates the priority-based encoding mechanism, the Pareto optimality
   and the swarm intelligence of the bee colony. The effect of the MDCSCN
   model are examined and validated through numerical experiment. The
   MDCSCN model is innovative and pioneering as it meets the latest
   requirements and outperforms the conventional SCN. More importantly, it
   builds the foundation for an intelligent customer order assignment
   system. The effectiveness and efficiency of the MOABC algorithm is
   evaluated in comparison with the other popular multi-objective
   meta-heuristic algorithm with promising results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{A hybrid differential evolution for optimal multilevel image
   thresholding}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{221-232}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Image thresholding is a process for separating interesting objects
   within an image from their background. An optimal threshold's selection
   can be regarded as a single objective optimization problem, where
   obtaining a solution can be computationally expensive and
   time-consuming, especially when the number of thresholds increases
   greatly. This paper proposes a novel hybrid differential evolution
   algorithm for selecting the optimal threshold values for a given
   gray-level input image, using the criterion defined by Otsu. The
   hybridization is done by adding a reset strategy, adopted from the
   Cuckoo Search, within the evolutionary loop of differential evolution.
   Additionally a study of different evolutionary or swarm-based
   intelligence algorithms for the purpose of thresholding, with a higher
   number of thresholds was performed, since many real-world applications
   require more than just a few thresholds for further processing.
   Experiments were performed on eleven real world images. The efficiency
   of the hybrid was compared to the cuckoo search and self-adaptive
   differential evolution, the original differential evolution, particle
   swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony where the results showed
   the superiority of the hybrid in terms of better segmentation results
   with the increased number of thresholds. Since the proposed method needs
   only two parameters adjusted, it is by far a better choice for real-life
   applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As a hot-spot of 5G, the research on detection algorithms for massive
   multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system is significant but
   difficult. The traditional MIMO detection algorithms or their
   improvements are not appropriate for large scaled antennas. In this
   paper, we propose artificial bee colony (ABC) detection algorithm for
   massive MIMO system. As one advanced technology of swarm intelligence,
   ABC algorithm is most efficient for large scaled constrained numerical
   combinatorial optimization problem. Therefore, we employ it to search
   the optimum solution vector in the modulation alphabet with linear
   detection result as initial. Simulation and data analysis prove the
   correctness and efficiency. Versus the scale of massive MIMO systems
   from 64 x 64 to 1024 x 1024 with uncoded
   four-quadrature-amplitude-modulation signals, the proposed ABC detection
   algorithm obtains bit error rate of 10(-5) at low average received
   signal-to-noise-ratio of 12 dB with rapid convergence rate, which
   approximates the optimum bit error rate performance of the maximum
   likelihood and achieves the theoretical optimum spectral efficiency with
   low required average received signal-to-noise-ratio of 10 dB in similar
   increasing regularity, over finite time of low polynomial computational
   complexity of O(N-T(2)) per symbol, where N-T denotes the transmitting
   antennas' number. The proposed ABC detection algorithm is efficient for

Title = {{May the same numerical optimizer be used when searching either for the
   best or for the worst solution to a real-world problem?}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{373}},
Pages = {{124-148}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Over the last two decades numerous metaheuristics have been proposed and
   it seems today that nobody is able to understand, evaluate, or compare
   them all. In principle, optimization methods, including the recently
   popular Evolutionary Computation or Swarm Intelligence-based ones,
   should be developed in order to solve real-world problems. Yet the vast
   majority of metaheuristics are tested in the source papers on artificial
   benchmarks only, so their usefulness for various practical applications
   remains unverified. As a result, choosing the proper method for a
   particular real-world problem is a difficult task. This paper shows that
   such a choice is even more complicated if one wishes, with good reason,
   to use metaheuristics twice, once to find the best and then to find the
   worst solutions for the specific numerical real-world problem. It often
   occurs that for either case different optimizers are to be recommended.
   The above finding is based on testing 30 metaheuristics on numerical
   real-world problems from CEC2011. First we solve 22 minimization
   problems as defined for CEC2011. Then we reverse the objective function
   for each problem and search for its maximizing solution. We also observe
   that algorithms that are highly ranked on average may not perform best
   for any given specific problem. Rather, the highest average ranking may
   be achieved by methods that are never among the poorest ones. In other
   words, occasional winners may get less attention than rare losers. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on developing new algorithms for distributed
   cooperative learning based on zero-gradient-sum (ZGS) optimization in a
   network setting. Specifically, the feed forward neural network with
   random weights (FNNRW) is introduced to train on data distributed across
   multiple learning agents, and each agent runs the program on a subset of
   the entire data. In this scheme, there is no requirement for a fusion
   center, due to, e.g., practical limitations, security, or privacy
   reasons. The centralized FNNRW problem is reformulated into an
   equivalent separable form with consensus constraints among nodes and is
   solved by the ZGS-based distributed optimization strategy, which
   theoretically guarantees convergence to the optimal solution. The
   proposed method is more effective than the existing methods using the
   decentralized average consensus (DAC) and alternating direction method
   of multipliers (ADMM) strategies. It is simple and requires less
   computational and communication resources, which is well suited for
   potential applications, such as wireless sensor networks, artificial
   intelligence, and computational biology, involving datasets that are
   often extremely large, high-dimensional and located on distributed data
   sources. We show simulation results on both synthetic and real-world
   datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Relatedness}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{216}},

Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{The measurement of the semantic relatedness between words has gained
   increasing interest in several research fields, including cognitive
   science, artificial intelligence, biology, and linguistics. The
   development of efficient measures is based on knowledge resources, such
   as Wikipedia, a huge and living encyclopedia supplied by net surfers. In
   this paper, we propose a novel approach based on multi-Layered Wikipedia
   representation for Computing word. Relatedness (LWCR) exploiting a
   weighting scheme based on Wikipedia Category Graph (WCG): Term
   Frequency-Inverse Category Frequency (tfxicf). Our proposal provides for
   each category pertaining to the WCG a Category Description Vector (CDV)
   including the weights of stems extracted from articles assigned to a
   category. The semantic relatedness degree is computed using the cosine
   measure between the CDVs assigned to the target words couple. The basic
   idea is followed by enhancement modules exploiting other Wikipedia
   features, such as article titles, redirection mechanism, and
   neighborhood category enrichment, to exploit semantic features and
   better quantify the semantic relatedness between words. To the best of
   our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate the WCG-based
   term-weighting scheme (tfxicf) into computing model of semantic
   relatedness. It is also the first work that exploits 17 datasets in the,
   assessment process, which are divided into two sets. The first set
   includes the ones designed for semantic similarity purposes: RG65, MOO,
   AG203, WP300, SimLexNoun666 and GeReSiD50Sim; the second includes
   datasets for semantic relatedness evaluation: WordSim353, GM30,
   Zeigler25, Zeigler30, MTurk287, MTurk771, MEN3000, Re1122, ReWord26,
   GeReSiD50 and SCWS1229. The found results are compared to WordNet-based
   measures and distributional measures cosine and PMI performed on
   Wikipedia articles. Experiments show that our approach provides
   consistent improvements over the state of the-art results on multiple
   benchmarks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic Algorithm (GA), a random universal evolutionary search technique
   that imitates the principle of biological evolution has been applied in
   solving various problems in different fields of human endeavor. Despite
   it strength and wide range of applications, optimal solution may not be
   feasible in situations where reproduction processes which involve
   chromosomes selection for mating and regeneration are not properly done.
   In addition, difficulty is often encountered when there are significant
   differences in the fitness values of chromosomes while using
   probabilistic based selection approach.
   In this work, clustering based GA with polygamy and dynamic population
   control mechanism have been proposed. Fitness value obtained from
   chromosomes in each generation were clustered into two-non- overlapping
   clusters. The surviving chromosomes in the selected cluster were
   subjected to polygamy crossover mating process while the population of
   the offsprings which would form the next generation were subjected to
   dynamic population control mechanisms. The process was repeated until
   convergence to global solution was achieved or number of generation
   elapsed. The proposed algorithm has been applied to route optimization
   problem. Results obtained showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms
   some of the existing techniques. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm
   converged to global solution within few iterations (generations) thus
   favoring its acceptability for online-realtime applications. It was also
   observed that the introduction of clustering based selection algorithm
   guaranteed the selection of cluster with the optimal solution in every
   generation. In addition, the introduction of dynamic population control
   with polygamy selection processes enabled fast convergence to optimal
   solution and diversity in the population respectively. (C) 2016 Karabuk

Abstract = {{Due to the inherent difficulties of nonlinear modelling, the studies for
   finding more practical methods on parameter estimation become more and
   more important. As well as numerical methods like Gauss-Newton, The
   Steepest Descent, Newton-Raphson, Levenberg-Marquardt Compromise
   algorithms etc., some methods based on artificial intelligence
   optimization get popularity among scientists increasingly. In this
   study, differential evolution algorithm (DEA) as one of the main
   artificial intelligence algorithms is used in nonlinear modelling. Then
   the parameter estimates by this method have been compared with those
   obtained by classic Gauss-Newton method. We have used three growth
   models, namely, Gompertz, Logistic and Weibull, in modeling. In the end,
   our emphasis is the similarity of parameter estimates realized by both
   methods. Hence DEA may be advocated for finding the similar results with
   greater simplicity.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Subset Construction (SC) is the classical algorithm for the
   determinization of a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) into an
   equivalent deterministic one (DFA). Although SC works fine in most
   application domains, it may be inappropriate when the NFA expands over
   time and determinization is required after each expansion, such as in
   diagnosis of active systems in artificial intelligence, or in
   model-based testing in software engineering. For such an expanding
   automaton, the IDEA algorithm (Incremental Determinization of Expanding
   Automata) may be more suitable. Given an NFA N, an equivalent DFA D, and
   an expansion Delta N of N, the determinization of N'=N boolean OR Delta
   N into D' is performed based not only on N' but also on Delta N and D.
   Rather than starting from scratch the generation of the DFA D'
   equivalent to N', IDEA applies the set of actions which are sufficient
   for transforming. into D'. This way, a possibly large part of the
   determinization process is avoided. Experiments show that the degree of
   convenience in determinizing expanding automata using IDEA rather than
   SC largely depends on the nature of the expanding automaton in the
   actual application domain.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of Musical Creativity and Musical Metacreation Systems}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN ENTERTAINMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3, 2, SI}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The field of computational creativity, including musical metacreation,
   strives to develop artificial systems that are capable of demonstrating
   creative behavior or producing creative artefacts. But the claim of
   creativity is often assessed, subjectively only on the part of the
   researcher and not objectively at all. This article provides theoretical
   motivation for more systematic evaluation of musical metacreation and
   computationally creative systems and presents an overview of current
   methods used to assess human and machine creativity that may be adapted
   for this purpose. In order to highlight the need for a varied set of
   evaluation tools, a distinction is drawn among three types of creative
   systems: those that are purely generative, those that contain internal
   or external feedback, and those that are capable of reflection and
   self-reflection. To address the evaluation of each of these aspects,
   concrete examples of methods and techniques are suggested to help
   researchers (1) evaluate their systems' creative process and generated
   artefacts, and test their impact on the perceptual, cognitive, and
   affective states of the audience, and (2) build mechanisms for
   reflection into the creative system, including models of human
   perception and cognition, to endow creative systems with internal
   evaluative mechanisms to drive self-reflective processes. The first type
   of evaluation can be considered external to the creative system and may
   be employed by the researcher to both better understand the efficacy of
   their system and its impact and to incorporate feedback into the system.
   Here we take the stance that understanding human creativity can lend
   insight to computational approaches, and knowledge of how humans
   perceive creative systems and their output can be incorporated into
   artificial agents as feedback to provide a sense of how a creation will
   impact the audience. The second type centers around internal evaluation,
   in which the system is able to reason about its own behavior and
   generated output. We argue that creative behavior cannot occur without
   feedback and reflection by the creative/metacreative system itself. More
   rigorous empirical testing will allow computational and metacreative
   systems to become more creative by definition and can be used to
   demonstrate the impact and novelty of particular approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Data processing, analysis and forecasting by applying artificial
   intelligence algorithms plays a pivotal role in the big data era. Hybrid
   forecasting of time series data is considered to be a potentially viable
   alternative compared with the conventional single forecasting modeling
   approaches. However, to perform forecasting in the electrical power
   system has been proven to be a challenging task due to various unstable
   factors, such as high fluctuations, autocorrelation and stochastic
   volatility. In this paper, a novel hybrid model that combines denoising
   methods and optimization algorithms with forecasting techniques is
   developed to solve the upper problems and forecast the key indicators in
   the electrical power system, including short-term wind speed, electrical
   load and electricity price. The proposed model can be applied to
   forecast the complex electrical power system with a high rate of
   convergence, forecasting accuracy and a fast computing speed. One of
   features of this paper is to integrate the already existing algorithms
   and models, which show a good forecasting performance. The results of
   three experiments confirm that the proposed hybrid model can
   satisfactorily approximate the actual value, and it can also be used as
   an effective and simple tool for planning for smart grids. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The challenge in data compression is to transmit or store a minimum
   number of bits per sample that should be as close as possible to the
   number of bits defined by the actual average information content. The
   latter can be approximated by the contextual entropy. The dilemma is
   generally that the optimal estimation of contextual symbol probabilities
   is a kind of artificial-intelligence problem and requires enormous
   computational efforts. Therefore, practical compression methods
   typically utilise some pre-knowledge about the data. In image
   compression, this concerns either autocorrelation properties of natural
   images, such as photographs, or assumptions about repeating patterns in
   synthetic data that often can be observed in screen content. This paper
   presents a novel technique for the estimation of the contextual symbol
   probabilities with moderate computational complexity. The probability
   distribution is derived for each single pixel based on a soft context
   formation and is fed into a full-adaptive arithmetic coder. Applied to
   synthetic images and images with mixed content up to 8000 colors, the
   proposed scheme shows bit-savings of about 20\% compared to the
   compression with the HEVC reference software (HM-16.7+SCM-6.0), and it
   also can compete with methods based on context mixing.}},

Abstract = {{We propose in this article an approach to optimize the processing time
   and to improve the quality of brain magnetic resonance images
   segmentation. Level set method (LSM) was adopted with a periodic
   reinitialization process to prevent the LS function from being too steep
   or too flat near the interface. Although it is used to maintain the
   stability of the interface evolution and gives interesting results, it
   requires a longer processing time.
   To overcome this disadvantage and reduce the processing time, we propose
   a hybridization with a regular Gaussian pyramid, which reduces the
   resolution of the initial image and prevents the possibility of local
   minima. To compare the different segmentation algorithms, we used six
   types of quality measurements: specificity, sensitivity, Dice
   similarity, the Jaccard index, and the correctly and incorrectly marked
   pixels. A comparison between the results obtained by LSM, LSM with
   reinitialization, the approach of Barman et al., An International
   Journal 1 (2011), particle swarm optimization based on the Chan and Vese
   model (Mandal et al., Engineering Applications of Artificial
   Intelligence 35 (2014), 199-214) and by our hybrid approach reveals a
   clear efficiency of our hybridization strategy. The processing time was
   significantly reduced, and the quality of segmentation was improved. (C)

Abstract = {{Diabetic retinopathy affects the vision of a significant fraction of the
   population worldwide. Retinal fundus images are used to detect the
   condition before vision loss develops to enable medical interventions.
   Optic disc detection is an essential step for the automatic detection of
   the disease. Several techniques have been introduced in the literature
   to detect the optic disc with different performance characteristics such
   as speed, accuracy and consistency. For optic disc detection, a
   nature-inspired algorithm called swarm intelligence has been shown to
   have clear superiority in terms of speed and accuracy compared to
   traditional detection algorithms. We therefore further investigated and
   compared several swarm intelligence techniques. Our study focused on
   five popular swarm intelligence algorithms: artificial bee colony,
   particle swarm optimization, bat algorithm, cuckoo search and firefly
   algorithm. This work also featured a novel pre-processing scheme that
   enhances the detection accuracy of the swarm techniques by making the
   optic disc region the highest grayscale value in the image. The
   pre-processing involves multiple stages of background subtraction,
   median filtering and mean filtering and is named Background
   Subtraction-based Optic Disc Detection (BSODD). The best result was
   obtained by combining our pre-processing technique, firefly algorithm
   and the parameters used for the algorithm. The obtained accuracy was
   superior to the other tested algorithms and published results in the
   literature. The accuracy of the firefly algorithm was 100\%, 100\%,
   98.82\% and 95\% when using the DRIVE, DiaRetDB1, DMED and STARE
   databases, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An adaptive and hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm (aABC) for ANFIS
   training}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we propose an Adaptive and Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony
   (aABC) algorithm to train ANFIS. Unlike the standard ABC algorithm, two
   new parameters are utilized in the solution search equation. These are
   arithmetic crossover rate and adaptivity coefficient. aABC algorithm
   gains the rapid convergence feature with the usage of arithmetic
   crossover and it is applied on two different problem groups and its
   performance is measured. Firstly, it is performed over 10 numerical
   `benchmark functions'. The results show that aABC algorithm is more
   efficient than standard ABC algorithm. Secondly, ANFIS is trained by
   using aABC algorithm to identify the nonlinear dynamic systems. Each
   application begins with the randomly selected initial population and
   then average RMSE is obtained. For four examples considered in ANFIS
   training, train error values are respectively computed as 0.0344,
   0.0232, 0.0152 and 0.0205. Also, test error values for these examples
   are respectively found as 0.0255, 0.0202, 0.0146 and 0.0295. Although it
   varies according to the examples, performance increase between 4.51\%
   and 33.33\% occurs. Additionally, it is seen that aABC algorithm
   converges bettter than ABC algorithm in the all examples. The obtained
   results are compared with the neuro-fuzzy based approaches which are
   commonly used in the literature and it is seen that the proposed ABC
   variant can be efficiently used for ANFIS training. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents GHOST, a combinatorial optimization framework that a

   problem encoded as a constraint satisfaction/optimization problem
   (CSP/COP). We show a way to model three different problems as aCSP/COP,
   using instances from the RTS game StarCraft as test beds. Each problem
   belongs to a specific level of abstraction (the target selection as
   reactive control problem, the wall-in as a tactics problem, and the
   build order planning as a strategy problem). In our experiments, GHOST
   shows good results computed within some tens of milliseconds. We also
   show that GHOST outperforms state-of-the-art constraint solvers,
   matching them on the resources allocation problem, a common
   combinatorial optimization problem.}},

Abstract = {{The development of problem solvers for configuration tasks is one of the
   most successful and mature application areas of artificial intelligence.
   The provision of tailored products, services, and systems requires
   efficient engineering and design processes where con figurators play a
   crucial role. Because one of the core competencies of Siemens is to
   provide such highly engineered and customized systems, ranging from
   solutions for medium-sized and small businesses up to huge industrial
   plants, the efficient implementation and maintenance of con figurators
   are important goals for the success of many departments. For more than
   25 years the application of constraint-based methods has proven to be a
   key technology in order to realize con figurators at Siemens. This
   article summarizes the main aspects and insights we have gained looking
   back over this period. In. particular, we highlight the main technology
   factors regarding knowledge representation, reasoning, and integration
   that were important for our achievement. Finally we describe selected
   key application areas where the business success vitally depends on the

Abstract = {{Carole Hafner's scholarship on the conceptual organization of case law
   knowledge bases (COC) was an original approach to distilling a library's
   worth of cases into a manageable subset that any given legal researcher
   could review. Her approach applied concept indexation and concept search
   based on an annotation model of three interacting components combined
   with a system of expert legal reasoning to aid in the retrieval of
   pertinent case law. Despite the clear value this tripartite approach
   would afford to researchers in search of cases with similar fact
   patterns and desired (or undesired) outcomes, this approach has not been
   applied consistently in the intervening years since its introduction.
   Specifically, the conceptual representation of domain concepts and the
   case frames were not pursued by researchers, and they were not applied
   by the legal case indexing services that came to dominate the electronic
   case law market. Advances since Hafner's original scholarship in the
   form of (1) digitized case law and related materials; (2) computer
   science analytical protocols; and (3) more advanced forms of artificial
   intelligence approaches present the question of whether Hafner's COC
   model could move from the hypothetical to the real.}},

   on argumentation, has become a prominent theme in artificial
   intelligence research on argumentation since the work by Hafner and
   Berman on teleological reasoning in the law, and was further developed
   by Bench-Capon in his value-based argumentation frameworks. One theme in
   the study of value-guided argumentation is the comparison of values.
   Formal models involving value comparison typically use either
   qualitative or quantitative primitives. In this paper, techniques
   connecting qualitative and quantitative primitives recently developed
   for evidential argumentation are applied to value-guided argumentation.
   By developing the theoretical understanding of intelligent systems
   guided by embedded values, the paper is a step towards ethical systems
   design, much needed in these days of ever more pervasive AI techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the continually evolving robot technology has contributed to
   the development of a variety of robot using service models. In
   particular, the robot with the artificial intelligence may be utilized
   in various fields of the context awareness. Conventional CCTV is
   installed in a fixed form and it can transfer monitored images to a
   central server where they are stored in the server system. The
   monitoring and control processes must be performed at the server side.
   In this paper, an intelligent surveillance robot for which Internet of
   Things(IoT) is used to overcome the limitations of these existing CCTV
   is proposed. The proposed intelligent surveillance robot is called
   ``SMART-I{''}, and it can perform monitoring and control remotely. Also
   a DVR server is included in the robot design for the transmission and
   processing of large image data. The prototype of SMART-I has been
   developed based on IoT, and both the app client and Web client have been
   implemented to provide the remote monitoring and control of the robot.
   SMART-I can be used as an active surveillance robot. While it monitors
   activities, it can detect abnormal contexts that are then notified to a
   security manager through the sending of alarm messages to a smartphone,
   allowing for a quick response to the potential risk. The developed
   IoT-based intelligent surveillance robot can perform monitoring
   activities in locations such as factories, offices, and industrial
   sites. SMART-I can be used as a user-friendly mobile robot that provides
   real-time monitoring and intelligent services according to the context
   awareness in a variety fields for an active performance of surveillance
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid artificial intelligence method (AIM) is used to optimize the
   atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) processing parameters for CoMoCrSi
   coatings deposited on Ti-6Al-4V substrates. In the proposed approach,
   the Taguchi design method is used to obtain an initial solution for the
   optimal set of APS parameters. The true optimal values of the spray
   distance, chamber pressure, current, argon gas flow rate and hydrogen
   gas flow rate are then obtained using an artificial neural network (ANN)
   and genetic algorithm (GA). The coatings deposited using the processing
   parameters determined using the Taguchi design method alone have a
   porosity of 8.5\%. However, following the ANN/GA optimization procedure,
   the porosity reduces to just 5.6\%. The XRD analysis results show that
   the as-sprayed coatings contain Cr3Si phase as a result of the
   high-temperature plasma flame. In addition, it is shown that the
   structure of the Ti phase in the coating transforms from a ce-Ti crystal
   structure (i.e., HCP) to a p-Ti crystal structure (i.e., BCC) during
   thermal treatment at temperatures to 1200 degrees C. Finally, it is
   shown that the hardness of the annealed coatings increases with both an
   increasing annealing time and an increasing annealing temperature. The
   higher hardness under higher temperature conditions is attributed to the
   precipitation of Cr3Si phase. Overall, the coatings obtained in the
   present study using the optimal spray-coating parameters have a low
   porosity, a high hardness and a good thermal stability at high
   temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Analyzing of flexible gripper by computational intelligence approach}},
Journal = {{MECHATRONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Adaptive grippers should be able to detect and recognize grasping
   objects. To be able to do it control algorithm need to be established to
   control gripper tasks. Compliant underactuated mechanisms with passive
   behavior can be used for modelling of adaptive robotic fingers.
   Undearactuation is a feature which allows fully adaptability of robotic
   fingers for different objects. In this study gripper with two fingers
   was established. Finite element method (FEM) procedure was used to
   optimize the gripper structural topology. Kinetostatic model of the
   underactuated finger mechanism was analyzed. This design of the gripper
   has embedded sensors as part of its structure. The use of embedded
   sensors in a robot gripper gives the control system the ability to
   control input displacement of the gripper and to recognize specific
   shapes of the grasping objects. Since the conventional control strategy
   is a very challenging task, soft computing based controllers are
   considered as potential candidates for such an application. The sensors
   could be used for grasping shape detection. Given that the contact
   forces of the finger depend on contact position of the finger and
   object, it is suitable to make a prediction model for the contact forces
   in function of contact positions of the finger and grasping objects. The
   prediction of the contact forces was established by using a soft
   computing (computational intelligence) approach. To perform the contact
   forces estimation adaptive neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS) methodology was used. FEM
   simulations were performed in order to acquire experimental data for
   ANFIS training. The main goal was to apply ANFIS network in order to
   find correlation between sensors' stresses and finger contact forces.
   Afterwards ANFIS results were compared with benchmark models (extreme
   learning machine (ELM), extreme learning machine with discrete wavelet
   algorithm (ELM-WAVELET), support vector machines (SVM), support vector
   machines with discrete wavelet algorithm (SVM-WAVELET), genetic
   programming (GP) and artificial neural network (ANN)). The reliability
   of these computational models was analyzed based on simulation results.

Abstract = {{The design of shunt passive filters has been a topic of constant
   research since the 70's. Due to the lower cost, passive shunt filters
   are still considered a preferred option. This paper presents a novel
   approach for the placement and sizing of passive filters through ranking
   solutions based on the minimization of the total harmonic distortion
   (THDV) of the supply system rather than one specific bus, without
   neglecting the individual harmonic distortions. The developed method was
   implemented using Matlab/Simulink and applied to a test system. The
   results shown that is possible to minimize the total voltage harmonic
   distortion using a system approach during the filter selection.
   Additionally, since the method is mainly based on a heurist approach, it
   avoids the complexity associated with of use of advanced mathematical
   tools such as artificial intelligence techniques. The analyses
   contemplate a sinusoidal voltage utility and also the condition with
   background distortion utility.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade noticeable progress has occurred in automated
   computer interpretation of visual information. Computers running
   artificial intelligence algorithms are growingly capable of extracting
   perceptual and semantic information from images, and registering it as
   metadata. There is also a growing body of manually produced image
   annotation data. All of this data is of great importance for scientific
   purposes as well as for commercial applications. Optimizing the
   usefulness of this, manually or automatically produced, information
   implies its precise and adequate expression at its different logical
   levels, making it easily accessible, manipulable and shareable. It also
   implies the development of associated manipulating tools. However, the
   expression and manipulation of computer vision results has received less
   attention than the actual extraction of such results. Hence, it has
   experienced a smaller advance. Existing metadata tools are poorly
   structured, in logical terms, as they intermix the declaration of visual
   detections with that of the observed entities, events and comprising
   context. This poor structuring renders such tools rigid, limited and
   cumbersome to use. Moreover, they are unprepared to deal with more
   advanced situations, such as the coherent expression of the information
   extracted from, or annotated onto, multi-view video resources. The work
   here presented comprises the specification of an advanced XML based
   syntax for the expression and processing of Computer Vision relevant
   metadata. This proposal takes inspiration from the natural cognition
   process for the adequate expression of the information, with a
   particular focus on scenarios of varying numbers of sensory devices,
   notably, multi-view video.}},

Title = {{Searching for structural bias in particle swarm optimization and
   differential evolution algorithms}},

Abstract = {{During the last two decades, a large number of metaheuristics have been
   proposed, leading to various studies that call for a deeper insight into
   the behaviour, efficiency and effectiveness of such methods. Among
   numerous concerns that are briefly reviewed in this paper, the presence
   of a structural bias (i.e. the tendency, not justified by the fitness
   landscape, to visit some regions of the search space more frequently
   than other regions) has recently been detected in simple versions of the
   genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. As of today, it
   remains unclear how frequently such a behaviour occurs in
   population-based swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation
   methods, and to what extent structural bias affects their performance.
   The present study focuses on the search for structural bias in various
   variants of particle swarm optimization and differential evolution
   algorithms, as well as in the traditional direct search methods proposed
   by Nelder-Mead and Rosenbrock half a century ago. We found that these
   historical direct search methods are structurally unbiased. However,
   most tested new metaheuristics are structurally biased, and at least
   some presence of structural bias can be observed in almost all their
   variants. The presence of structural bias seems to be stronger in
   particle swarm optimization algorithms than in differential evolution
   algorithms. The relationships between the strength of the structural
   bias and the dimensionality of the search space, the number of allowed
   function calls and the population size are complex and hard to
   generalize. For 14 algorithms tested on the CEC2011 real-world problems
   and the CEC2014 artificial benchmarks, no clear relationship between the
   strength of the structural bias and the performance of the algorithm was
   found. However, at least for artificial benchmarks, such old and
   structurally unbiased methods like Nelder-Mead algorithm performed
   relatively well. This is a warning that the presence of structural bias
   in novel metaheuristics may hamper their search abilities.}},

Abstract = {{In the middle of the 1980s, David Poole introduced a semantic,
   model-theoretic notion of specificity to the artificial-intelligence
   community. Since then it has found further applications in non-monotonic
   reasoning, in particular in defeasible reasoning. Poole tried to
   approximate the intuitive human concept of specificity, which seems to
   be essential for reasoning in everyday life with its partial and
   inconsistent information. His notion, however, turns out to be intricate
   and problematic, which - as we show - can be overcome to some extent by
   a closer approximation of the intuitive human concept of specificity.
   Besides the intuitive advantages of our novel specificity orderings over
   Poole's specificity relation in the classical examples of the
   literature, we also report some hard mathematical facts: Contrary to
   what was claimed before, we show that Poole's relation is not transitive
   in general. The first of our specificity orderings (CP1) captures
   Poole's original intuition as close as we could get after the correction
   of its technical flaws. The second one (CP2) is a variation of CP1 and
   presents a step toward similar notions that may eventually solve the
   intractability problem of Poole-style specificity relations. The present
   means toward deciding our novel specificity relations, however, show
   only slight improvements over the known ones for Poole's relation;
   therefore, we suggest a more efficient workaround for applications in
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Research on multiobjective optimization problems becomes one of the
   hottest topics of intelligent computation. In order to improve the
   search efficiency of an evolutionary algorithm and maintain the
   diversity of solutions, in this paper, the learning automata (LA) is
   first used for quantization orthogonal crossover (QOX), and a new
   fitness function based on decomposition is proposed to achieve these two
   purposes. Based on these, an orthogonal evolutionary algorithm with LA
   for complex multiobjective optimization problems with continuous
   variables is proposed. The experimental results show that in continuous
   states, the proposed algorithm is able to achieve accurate
   Pareto-optimal sets and wide Pareto-optimal fronts efficiently.
   Moreover, the comparison with the several existing well-known
   algorithms: nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II,
   decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm,
   decompositionbased multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with an
   ensemble of neighborhood sizes, multiobjective optimization by LA, and
   multiobjective immune algorithm with nondominated neighbor-based
   selection, on 15 multiobjective benchmark problems, shows that the
   proposed algorithm is able to find more accurate and evenly distributed
   Pareto-optimal fronts than the compared ones.}},

Abstract = {{A significant number of people pass away due to limited medical
   resources for the battle with cancer. Fatal cases can be reduced by
   using the computational techniques in the medical and health system. If
   the cancer is diagnosed early, the chance of successful treatment
   increases. In this study, the risk of getting lung cancer will be
   obtained and patients will be provided with directions to exterminate
   the risk. After calculating the risk value for lung cancer, status of
   the patient's susceptibility and resistance to stress is used in
   determining the effects of stress to disease. In order to resolve the
   problem, the neuro-fuzzy logic model has been presented. When
   encouraging results are obtained from the study; the system will form a
   pre-diagnosis for the people who possibly can have risk of getting
   cancer due to working conditions or living standards. Therefore, this
   study will enable these people to take precautions to prevent the risk
   of cancer. In this study a new t-norm operator has been utilized in the
   problem. Finally, the performance of the proposed method has been
   compared to other methods. Beside this, the contribution of neuro-fuzzy
   logic model in the field of health and topics of artificial intelligence
   will also be examined in this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

   concepts introduced in the field, a significant improvement in the

   Furthermore, a late fusion of the CNN-based recognition block with
   various hand-crafted features (local binary patterns, histograms of

Abstract = {{Artificial Fish Swarm is a kind of swarm intelligence algorithm, which
   focuses on the behavior of individual fishes and information
   interactions among them during foraging and preying on something in real
   environment. A novel Artificial Fish Swarm Optimization Algorithm Aided
   by Ocean Current Power (abbreviation for AFSAOCP) is proposed, which
   assumes the ocean current always causes certain influence on the fishes'
   activity speed. Firstly, the computing model of ocean current is
   developed and constructed. Then the influence level of the ocean current
   on fishes is analyzed. If fishes are swimming along ocean current
   direction, ocean current will drive fishes' speed increment, which is
   called positive influence; if fishes are swimming against ocean current,
   the current will hinder the fishes' speed, which is called negative
   influence. In addition, fishes' speed is not influenced by the ocean
   current, which is called merits offset faults. To sum this up, fishes in
   each group have different speed range, respectively. Grouping strategies
   can not only increase species diversity, but it can also make the
   algorithm escape from local optimal value in the iteration process. The
   proposed variant, AFSAOCP, is examined on several widely used
   benchmarked functions, and the experimental results show that the
   proposed AFSAOCP algorithm improves the existing performance of other
   algorithms when dealing with the different dimension and multimodal

   problems, such as combinatorial optimisation, reinforcement learning,
   and games, is due to its ability to rapidly evaluate problem states
   without requiring domain-specific knowledge. However, it has been
   acknowledged that the trade-off between exploration and exploitation is
   crucial for the performance of the algorithm, and affects the efficiency
   of the agent in learning deceptive states. One type of deception is
   states that give immediate rewards, but lead to a suboptimal solution in
   the long run. These states are known as trap states, and have been
   thoroughly investigated in previous research. In this work, we study the
   opposite of trap states, known as sacrifice states, which are deceptive
   moves that result in a local loss but are globally optimal, and
   investigate the efficiency of MCTS enhancements in identifying this type
   of moves.}},

Abstract = {{Users of research databases, such as CiteSeer(X), Google Scholar, and
   Microsoft Academic, often search for papers using a set of keywords.
   Unfortunately, many authors avoid listing sufficient keywords for their
   papers. As such, these applications may need to automatically associate
   good descriptive keywords with papers. When the full text of the paper
   is available this problem has been thoroughly studied. In many cases,
   however, due to copyright limitations, research databases do not have
   access to the full text. On the other hand, such databases typically
   maintain metadata, such as the title and abstract and the citation
   network of each paper. In this paper we study the problem of predicting
   which keywords are appropriate for a research paper, using different
   methods based on the citation network and available metadata. Our main
   goal is in providing search engines with the ability to extract keywords
   from the available metadata. However, our system can also be used for
   other applications, such as for recommending keywords for the authors of
   new papers. We create a data set of research papers, and their citation
   network, keywords, and other metadata, containing over 470K papers with
   and more than 2 million keywords. We compare our methods with predicting
   keywords using the title and abstract, in offline experiments and in a
   user study, concluding that the citation network provides much better
   predictions.}},

Journal = {{ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{196-206}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although creativity is studied from philosophy to cognitive robotics, a
   definition has proven elusive. We argue for emphasizing the creative
   process (the cognition of the creative agent), rather than the creative
   product (the artifact or behavior). Owing to developments in
   experimental psychology, the process approach has become an increasingly
   attractive way of characterizing creative problem solving. In
   particular, the phenomenon of insight, in which an individual arrives at
   a solution through a sudden change in perspective, is a crucial
   component of the process of creativity.
   These developments resonate with advances in machine learning, in
   particular hierarchical and modular approaches, as the field of
   artificial intelligence aims for general solutions to problems that
   typically rely on creativity in humans or other animals. We draw a
   parallel between the properties of insight according to psychology and
   the properties of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) systems for
   embodied agents. Using the Creative Systems Framework developed by
   Wiggins and Ritchie, we analyze both insight and HRL, establishing that
   they are creative in similar ways. We highlight the key challenges to be
   met in order to call an artificial system ``insightful{''}. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{While perception tasks such as visual object recognition and text
   understanding play an important role in human intelligence, subsequent
   tasks that involve inference, reasoning, and planning require an even
   higher level of intelligence. The past few years have seen major
   advances in many perception tasks using deep learning models. For
   higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with
   their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. To achieve
   integrated intelligence that involves both perception and inference, it
   is naturally desirable to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian
   models within a principled probabilistic framework, which we call
   Bayesian deep learning. In this unified framework, the perception of
   text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of
   higher-level inference and in return, the feedback from the inference
   process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This paper
   proposes a general framework for Bayesian deep learning and reviews its
   recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, and control.
   In this paper, we also discuss the relationship and differences between
   Bayesian deep learning and other related topics such as the Bayesian
   treatment of neural networks.}},

Abstract = {{The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a recently introduced swarm
   intelligence optimization algorithm based on the foraging behavior of a
   honeybee colony. However, many problems are encountered in the ABC
   algorithm, such as premature convergence and low solution precision.
   Moreover, it can easily become stuck at local optima. The scout bees
   start to search for food sources randomly and then they share nectar
   information with other bees. Thus, this paper proposes a global
   reconnaissance foraging swarm optimization algorithm that mimics the
   intelligent foraging behavior of scouts in nature. First, under the new
   scouting search strategies, the scouts conduct global reconnaissance
   around the assigned subspace, which is effective to avoid premature
   convergence and local optima. Second, the scouts guide other bees to
   search in the neighborhood by applying heuristic information about
   global reconnaissance. The cooperation between the honeybees will
   contribute to the improvement of optimization performance and solution
   precision. Finally, the prediction and selection mechanism is adopted to
   further modify the search strategies of the employed bees and onlookers.
   Therefore, the search performance in the neighborhood of the local
   optimal solution is enhanced. The experimental results conducted on 52
   typical test functions show that the proposed algorithm is more
   effective in avoiding premature convergence and improving solution
   precision compared with some other ABCs and several state-of-the-art
   algorithms. Moreover, this algorithm is suitable for optimizing
   high-dimensional space optimization problems, with very satisfactory
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Personalization is the process of fitting a model to patient data, a
   critical step towards application of multi-physics computational models
   in clinical practice. Designing robust personalization algorithms is
   often a tedious, time-consuming, model- and data-specific process. We
   propose to use artificial intelligence concepts to learn this task,
   inspired by how human experts manually perform it. The problem is
   reformulated in terms of reinforcement learning. In an off-line phase,
   Vito, our self-taught artificial agent, learns a representative decision
   process model through exploration of the computational model: it learns
   how the model behaves under change of parameters. The agent then
   automatically learns an optimal strategy for on-line personalization.
   The algorithm is model-independent; applying it to a new model requires
   only adjusting few hyper-parameters of the agent and defining the
   observations to match. The full knowledge of the model itself is not
   required. Vito was tested in a synthetic scenario, showing that it could
   learn how to optimize cost functions generically. Then Vito was applied
   to the inverse problem of cardiac electrophysiology and the
   personalization of a whole-body circulation model. The obtained results
   suggested that Vito could achieve equivalent, if not better goodness of
   fit than standard methods, while being more robust (up to 11\% higher
   success rates) and with faster (up to seven times) convergence rate. Our
   artificial intelligence approach could thus make personalization
   algorithms generalizable and self-adaptable to any patient and any
   model. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Large volume of high-speed streaming data is generated by big power
   grids continuously. In order to detect and avoid power grid failure,
   decision support systems (DSSs) are commonly adopted in power grid
   enterprises. Among all the decision-making algorithms, incremental
   decision tree is the most widely used one. In this paper, we propose a
   combined classifier that is a composite of a cache-based classifier
   (CBC) and a main tree classifier (MTC). We integrate this classifier
   into a stream processing engine on top of the DSS such that high-speed
   steaming data can be transformed into operational intelligence
   efficiently. Experimental results show that our proposed classifier can
   return more accurate answers than other existing ones.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, many recent applications retain traces of their usage by
   collecting user information. These traces help to understand user
   behavior and activities thus reflect the context. This paper describes
   how interaction traces allow the building of contextual recommendations
   using a Trace-Based Reasoning approach. Trace-Based Reasoning is an
   artificial intelligence paradigm that draws its inspiration from Case
   Based Reasoning. In TBR, modeled traces act as the main knowledge
   container. The application considered in this paper, Wanaclip, is an
   interactive online video clip composition application. We added a
   recommendation system that guides users in both video creation and
   selection. The recommendation engine is fueled by interaction traces
   provided by previous users and is stored in TStore, a Trace Base
   Management System that handles the storage, processing and exploitation
   of traces. This approach uses similarity measures for finding and
   comparing episodes of traces. We validate our approach by proposing a
   variation to the classical accuracy definition, which we call
   ``acceptance rate{''}. Our evaluations show that this approach offers
   satisfactory results in term of recommendations and response time. (C)

Title = {{A multi-objective intelligent water drop algorithm to minimise cost Of
   goods sold and time to market in logistics networks}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{455-466}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The Intelligent Water Drop (IWD) algorithm is inspired by the movement
   of natural water drops (WD) in a river. A stream can find an optimum
   path considering the conditions of its surroundings to reach its
   ultimate goal, which is often a sea. In the process of reaching such
   destination, the WD and the environment interact with each other as the
   WD moves through the river bed. Similarly, the supply chain problem can
   be modelled as a flow of stages that must be completed and optimised to
   obtain a finished product that is delivered to the end user. Every stage
   may have one or more options to be satisfied such as suppliers,
   manufacturing or delivery options. Each option is characterised by its
   time and cost. Within this context, multi-objective optimisation
   approaches are particularly well suited to provide optimal solutions.
   This problem has been classified as NP hard; thus, this paper proposes
   an approach aiming to solve the logistics network problem using a
   modified multi-objective extension of the IWD which returns a Pareto
   set.
   Artificial WD, flowing through the supply chain, will simultaneously
   minimise the cost of goods sold and the lead time of every product
   involved by using the concept of Pareto optimality. The proposed
   approach has been tested over instances widely used in literature
   yielding promising results which are supported by the performance
   measurements taken by comparison to the ant colony meta-heuristic as
   well as the true fronts obtained by exhaustive enumeration. The Pareto
   set returned by IWD is computed in 4 s and the generational distance,
   spacing, and hyper-area metrics are very close to those computed by
   exhaustive enumeration. Therefore, our main contribution is the design
   of a new algorithm that overcomes the algorithm proposed by
   Moncayo-Martinez and Zhang (2011).
   This paper contributes to enhance the current body of knowledge of
   expert and intelligent systems by providing a new, effective and
   efficient IWD-based optimisation method for the design and configuration
   of supply chain and logistics networks taking into account multiple
   objectives simultaneously. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   foundations from cognitive science to operational computer model}},
Journal = {{COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{46-58}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article deals with artificial intelligence models inspired from
   cognitive science. The scope of this paper is the simulation of the
   decision-making process for virtual entities. The theoretical framework
   consists of concepts from the use of internal behavioral simulation for
   human decision-making. Inspired from such cognitive concepts, the
   contribution consists in a computational framework that enables a
   virtual entity to possess an autonomous world of simulation within the
   simulation. It can simulate itself (using its own model of behavior) and
   simulate its environment (using its representation of other entities).
   The entity has the ability to anticipate using internal simulations, in
   complex environments where it would be extremely difficult to use formal
   proof methods. Comparing the prediction and the original simulation, its
   predictive models are improved through a learning process. Illustrations
   of this model are provided through two implementations. First
   illustration is an example showing a shepherd, his herd and dogs. The
   dog simulates the sheep's behavior in order to make predictions testing
   different strategies. Second, an artificial 3D juggler plays in
   interaction with virtual jugglers, humans and robots. For this
   application, the juggler predicts the behavior of balls in the air and
   uses prediction to coordinate its behavior in order to juggle. (C) 2016

Journal = {{SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Online social networks (OSNs) such as Twitter and Facebook have become a
   significant testing ground for Artificial Intelligence developers who
   build programs, known as socialbots, that imitate human users by
   automating their social network activities such as forming social links
   and posting content. Particularly, Twitter users have shown difficulties
   in distinguishing these socialbots from the human users in their social
   graphs. Frequently, socialbots are effective in acquiring human users as
   followers and exercising influence within them. While the success of
   socialbots is certainly a remarkable achievement for AI practitioners,
   their proliferation in the Twitter sphere opens many possibilities for
   cybercrime. The proliferation of socialbots in Twitter motivates us to
   assess the characteristics or strategies that make socialbots most
   likely to succeed. In this direction, we created 120 socialbot accounts
   in Twitter, which have a profile, follow other users, and generate
   tweets either by reposting others' tweets or by generating their own
   synthetic tweets. Then, we employ a 2(k) factorial design experiment to
   quantify the infiltration performance of different socialbot strategies,
   and examine the effectiveness of individual profile and activity-related
   attributes of the socialbots. Our analysis is the first of a kind, and
   reveals what strategies make socialbots successful in the Twitter

Title = {{Soft-sensing estimation of plant effluent concentrations in a biological
   wastewater treatment plant using an optimal neural network}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{8-19}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies into the estimation and control of an activated sludge
   process (ASP) at a wastewater treatment plant suggest that
   artificial-intelligence methods, such as neural networks, fuzzy systems
   and genetic algorithms, can improve the plant performance in terms of
   reduced operation costs and improved effluent quality. In this paper, a
   neural-network-based soft sensor is developed for the on-line prediction
   of effluent concentrations in an ASP in terms of primary hard-to-measure
   variables, such as chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen content and
   total suspended solids, starting from secondary on-line easy to-measure
   variables, such as oxygen and nitrogen compound concentrations in
   biological tanks, input flow rate and alkalinity, among others. An
   algorithm based on principal component analysis is applied to select the
   optimal net input vectors for the soft sensor, using an appropriated
   number of samples of the secondary variables set. The proposed soft
   sensor is tested on the ASP of a large-scale municipal wastewater
   treatment plant running under the GPS-X simulation frame and validated
   with operational gathered data. Satisfactory low values for mean and
   maximum absolute prediction errors are obtained, even when high values
   of sampling time of primary variables are set, as it is frequently done
   during monitoring operation. In this way, data-driven soft-sensors based
   on neural networks can become valuable tools for plant operators for the
   recognition of operational states in terms of low cost and efficient
   prediction of primary process variables such as chemical oxygen demand,
   total nitrogen content and total suspended solids, therefore avoiding
   the acquisition of expensive and sometimes unreliable instruments for
   measuring nutrient concentrations in plant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Colonoscopy exam images are useful to identify diseases, such as the
   colorectal cancer, which is one of the most common cancers worldwide.
   Computational image analysis and machine learning techniques can assist
   experts to identify abnormalities in these images. In this work, we
   present and evaluate MIAS 3.0, which aims to help experts to study and
   analyze colon tissue images. To do so, the system initially extracts
   features from these images. Currently, Amadasum, Haralick and Laws
   texture descriptors are supported. Then, the described images are
   classified into normal or abnormal images. In this version, J48, nearest
   neighbor, backpropagation based on multilayer perceptron, naive Bayes,
   and support vector machine classification algorithms are implemented.
   MIAS was developed with open source technologies using a software
   engineering approach to improve flexibility and maintainability. In this
   work, MIAS was quantitatively assessed by its application in a set of
   134 tissue image fragments. The classifiers built from this set were
   compared according to the cross-validation and contingency table
   strategies. Also, the system was qualitatively evaluated using 12
   heuristics by twelve volunteers from Health and Exact Sciences. The
   issues found were categorized according to Rolf Molich's severity scale.
   As a result, the J48 classifier achieved the highest sensitivity
   (85.07\%) and reasonable average error (18.68\%). In the qualitative
   evaluation, 61.26\% of the issues found were not considered serious.
   These assessments suggest that MIAS can be useful to assist domain
   experts with minimum knowledge in informatics to conduct more complete
   studies of medical images, by identifying patterns regarding different
   abnormalities. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Optimal virtual network embedding based on artificial bee colony}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{As one of the key challenges in network virtualization, the problem of
   virtual network embedding has attracted significant attention from
   researchers. In this problem, it needs to embed virtual networks with
   both node and link demands into a shared physical network. The main goal
   of this problem is to embed more virtual networks to gain more revenue.
   However, the prior approaches still suffer from low performance and
   await to be further optimized in terms of this goal. In this paper, we
   design an artificial bee colony-based virtual network embedding
   algorithm, called VNE-ABC, to solve this problem. The core idea of this
   algorithm is to leverage the iterations and intelligence of artificial
   bee colony to achieve a more optimal solution for virtual network
   embedding. Through simulations, we show that our proposed algorithm
   gains about 35.4\% more revenue than the existing algorithm.}},

Title = {{Biomechanical Reconstruction Using the Tacit Learning System: Intuitive
   Control of Prosthetic Hand Rotation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: For mechanically reconstructing human biomechanical
   function, intuitive proportional control, and robustness to unexpected
   situations are required. Particularly, creating a functional hand
   prosthesis is a typical challenge in the reconstruction of lost
   biomechanical function. Nevertheless, currently available control
   algorithms are in the development phase. The most advanced algorithms
   for controlling multifunctional prosthesis are machine learning and
   pattern recognition of myoelectric signals. Despite the increase in
   computational speed, these methods cannot avoid the requirement of user
   consciousness and classified separation errors. Tacit Learning System is
   a simple but novel adaptive control strategy that can self-adapt its
   posture to environment changes. We introduced the strategy in the
   prosthesis rotation control to achieve compensatory reduction, as well
   as evaluated the system and its effects on the user.
   Methods: We conducted a non-randomized study involving eight prosthesis
   users to perform a bar relocation task with/without Tacit Learning
   System support. Hand piece and body motions were recorded continuously
   with goniometers, videos, and a motion-capture system.
   Findings: Reduction in the participants' upper extremity rotatory
   compensation motion was monitored during the relocation task in all
   participants. The estimated profile of total body energy consumption
   improved in five out of six participants.
   Interpretation: Our system rapidly accomplished nearly natural motion
   without unexpected errors. The Tacit Learning System not only adapts
   human motions but also enhances the human ability to adapt to the system
   quickly, while the system amplifies compensation generated by the
   residual limb. The concept can be extended to various situations for
   reconstructing lost functions that can be compensated.}},

Abstract = {{The authors address the problem of coherent multitarget localisation for
   distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar, in the presence
   of phase synchronisation mismatch between each transmitter-receiver
   pair. The inherent sparsity of targets in the surveillance area can be
   exploited to represent radar data and then target locations are
   accurately estimated using sparse reconstruction. However, due to the
   difficulty of perfect phase synchronisation, the localisation technique
   is usually required to eliminate the phase errors. This study jointly
   considers the phase error correction problem in the context of
   multitarget localisation. In this novel method, the direct position
   determination of multitarget is obtained by estimating the spare
   reflection coefficients and phase errors alternately. Numerical
   simulation results demonstrate that the authors' iterative block sparse
   Bayesian learning via maximum likelihood estimation algorithm obtains
   enhanced estimation accuracy against the phase synchronisation mismatch.}},

Abstract = {{In a competitive electricity market, suppliers seek the optimal bidding
   strategy, maximising their individual profit. Due to the uncertainties,
   unknown parameters and dynamics of electricity market, the optimal
   bidding strategies cannot be attained through straightforward
   optimisation methods. In this study, the supply function equilibrium
   model is considered together with uniform price market clearing
   mechanism. The interaction among suppliers is modelled as an incomplete
   information game problem and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
   is utilised to find the optimal bidding strategy of the suppliers in a
   non-cooperative game. The proposed framework is an extension, from
   single agent Markov decision process to Markov game process, which is
   suitable for studying multi-agent decision making problems in stochastic
   environments. In this study, a Markov game model of the electricity
   market is proposed and a new state-action and Markov model of
   electricity market is proposed to built up the MARL environment. In
   addition, a learning-based non-cooperative MARL method is utilised for
   learning the optimal bidding strategies of the suppliers in a day-ahead
   electricity market. The proposed method is successfully applied to
   IEEE-30-bus power system. To examine the statistical significance of the
   results, the T-test method is applied to compare the competitive
   behaviour of the players in both multi- and single-agent frameworks.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a comprehensive analytical study of a fuzzy
   proportional-integral-derivative (fuzzy-PID) controller with derivative
   filter (fuzzy-PIDF) for automatic generation control (AGC) in multi-area
   power system tuned by a novel hybrid local unimodal sampling-teaching
   learning based optimisation (LUS-TLBO) algorithm. The relevant advantage
   of this recommended controller is its high sensitivity to load
   perturbation. Initially a two area non-reheat type thermal system is
   considered and the gains of PIDF controller are tuned employing hybrid
   LUS-TLBO algorithm. The supremacy of PIDF controller is shown by
   comparing the results with some recently published articles. The study
   is further extended to design fuzzy logic based PID controller with
   derivative filter (fuzzy-PIDF) for AGC of the same power system
   employing hybrid LUS-TLBO algorithm. Supremacy of the proposed approach
   is shown by comparing the results with another recently published
   article. In addition, the work is also extended to deal with AGC issues
   in two area multi source hydro thermal power system using the proposed
   controller. Finally, it is seen that fuzzy-PIDF controller retains its
   supremacy over PID/PIDF/fuzzy-PID controllers. In addition to it,
   robustness analysis is carried out for the non-reheat two area thermal
   power systems by varying different parameters within the range of +/-
   50\%.}},

Abstract = {{Power transformers are some of the most valuable and critical elements
   of power systems. Therefore, accurate and detailed assessment of
   technical and economical (techno-economical) condition of the
   transformers is absolutely important to ensure its reliable operation.
   In this study, in order to assess the overall condition of the power
   transformers, an overall condition index (OI) obtained from technical
   lifetime index (TI) and economical lifetime index (EI) will be defined.
   The OI index, which provides a practical tool to assess the overall
   condition of the asset, combines the results of operating observations,
   field inspections, site and laboratory testing, and analysis of
   investment and operating and maintenance costs into an overall index. An
   adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model is used to assess the TI,
   and a fuzzy logic model is used for EI evaluation. Large power
   transformers rated over 50 MVA, which are more critical and important in
   the network, are investigated. The models are developed using 170
   experimental field datasets of transformer oil characteristics and
   dissolved gas analysis, and economical data such as operating and
   maintenance costs. The results prove that the models can be used to
   effectively assess the techno-economical lifetime of power transformers.}},

Title = {{Early warning method for transmission line galloping based on SVM and

Abstract = {{Transmission line galloping often causes structural and electrical
   failures, which is a serious threat to the security of transmission
   systems. Through analysing the influence factors of galloping, it
   reveals that weather conditions are the most significant excitation
   factors and conductors of any voltage level and region may gallop when
   the apt-galloping weather conditions are satisfied. This study proposes
   an early warning method for transmission line galloping based on support
   vector machine (SVM) and AdaBoost bi-level classifiers. First, a
   prediction model of apt-galloping weather conditions based on an SVM
   classifier is built through data mining of historical weather parameters
   in regions where galloping frequently occurred. When the forecast
   weather conditions of a particular region satisfy the apt-galloping
   weather conditions, the conductor type, cross-section and span of
   transmission line are further considered to realise early warning of
   galloping through an AdaBoost classifier. Finally, the historical
   galloping events of a power grid are adopted to verify the validity of
   the proposed methods. The test results indicate that both the accurate
   classification rate and accurate warning rate are above 90\%, whereas
   the missed warning rate is below 10\%. The models are suitable for early
   warning of transmission line galloping and can provide important
   decision support for operation staff of power grid.}},

Abstract = {{Exponential growth of information generated by social networks requires
   efficient and scalable recommendation techniques to produce useful
   results. Traditional methods have become unqualified because they
   consider only ratings instead of rankings in an item list, and they
   ignore social contextual information, which is valuable for predicting
   users' preference. It is significant and challenging to fuse social
   contextual information into learning to recommendation methods. In this
   study, the authors first extend user latent features by exploiting
   users' social relationship such as friendship or trust relations, and
   extend item latent features with concurrent items. Then they integrate
   both users' and items' social contextual information into a pairwise
   learning to recommendation model (named as UIContextRank) to enhance
   ranking accuracy and recommendation quality. Furthermore, they extend
   UIContextRank in a distributed environment to improve efficiency and
   scalability. The authors conduct experiments on both bidirectional and
   unidirectional social network datasets. The results show that their
   method significantly outperforms other approaches.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Embodied artificial cognitive systems, such as autonomous robots or
   intelligent observers, connect cognitive processes to sensory and
   effector systems in real time. Prime candidates for such embodied
   intelligence are neurally inspired architectures. While components such
   as forward neural networks are well established, designing pervasively
   autonomous neural architectures remains a challenge. This includes the
   problem of tuning the parameters of such architectures so that they
   deliver specified functionality under variable environmental conditions
   and retain these functions as the architectures are expanded. The
   scaling and autonomy problems are solved, in part, by dynamic field
   theory (DFT), a theoretical framework for the neural grounding of
   sensorimotor and cognitive processes. In this paper, we address how to
   efficiently build DFT architectures that control embodied agents and how
   to tune their parameters so that the desired cognitive functions emerge
   while such agents are situated in real environments. In DFT
   architectures, dynamic neural fields or nodes are assigned dynamic
   regimes, that is, attractor states and their instabilities, from which
   cognitive function emerges. Tuning thus amounts to determining values of
   the dynamic parameters for which the components of a DFT architecture
   are in the specified dynamic regime under the appropriate environmental
   conditions. The process of tuning is facilitated by the software
   framework cedar, which provides a graphical interface to build and
   execute DFT architectures. It enables to change dynamic parameters
   online and visualize the activation states of any component while the
   agent is receiving sensory inputs in real time. Using a simple example,
   we take the reader through the workflow of conceiving of DFT
   architectures, implementing them on embodied agents, tuning their
   parameters, and assessing performance while the system is coupled to
   real sensory inputs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Color matching of fabric blends is a key issue for the textile industry,
   mainly due to the rising need to create high-quality products for the
   fashion market. The process of mixing together differently colored
   fibers to match a desired color is usually performed by using some
   historical recipes, skillfully managed by company colorists. More often
   than desired, the first attempt in creating a blend is not satisfactory,
   thus requiring the experts to spend efforts in changing the recipe with
   a trial-and-error process. To confront this issue, a number of
   computer-based methods have been proposed in the last decades, roughly
   classified into theoretical and artificial neural network (ANN)-based
   approaches. Inspired by the above literature, the present paper provides
   a method for accurate estimation of spectrophotometric response of a
   textile blend composed of differently colored fibers made of different
   materials. In particular, the performance of the Kubelka-Munk (K-M)
   theory is enhanced by introducing an artificial intelligence approach to
   determine a more consistent value of the nonlinear function relationship
   between the blend and its components. Therefore, a hybrid K-M+ANN-based
   method capable of modeling the color mixing mechanism is devised to
   predict the reflectance values of a blend. (C) 2016 SPIE and IS\&T}},

Abstract = {{Accurate diagnosis of incipient faults in oil-filled power transformers
   is important in preventive maintenance of transformers. Dissolved gas
   analysis (DGA) is an effective tool to diagnose incipient transformer
   faults. The majority of the methods reported in literature to analyze
   DGA results lay more emphasis on user experience rather than
   mathematical formulation/justification. Furthermore, sometimes DGA
   results for a certain fault do not belong to any of the IEC/IEEE
   standard and cannot be categorized/diagnosed. To address these issues,
   we propose a new approach for DGA interpretation using gene expression
   programming (GEP). The proposed approach is employed for analysis of 552
   DGA samples collected from transformers of Himachal Pradesh State
   Electricity Board, India, in conjunction with samples extracted from
   reliable literature. We use the aforementioned dataset to test and
   validate our proposed GEP model. We also compare the performance of our
   approach against other artificial intelligence-based techniques such as
   artificial neural network, fuzzy-logic, and support vector machine.
   Results and comparison against other soft computing approaches show
   relative superiority of GEP-based DGA interpretation in terms of

Abstract = {{Nowadays, Sales Forecasting is vital for any business in competitive
   atmosphere. For an accurate forecasting, correct variables should be
   considered. In this paper, we address these problems and a technique is
   proposed which combines two artificial intelligence algorithms in order
   to forecast future automobile sales in Saipa group which is a leading
   Automobile manufacturer in Iran. Anfis is used as the base technique
   which is combined with GA. GA is used in order to tune the Anfis
   results. Furthermore, sales forecasting is succeeded with annual data of
   years between 1990 and 2016. With this in mind, per capita income,
   inflation rate, housing, Importation, Currency Rate (USD), loan interest
   rate and automobile import tariffs are selected as effective variables
   in the proposed model. Finally, we compare our model with ANN model
   which is a well-known forecasting model.}},

   algorithms, in terms of running time and cost of search time. To examine
   the performance of the implemented algorithm, several experiments were
   performed with various combinations. The algorithm was evaluated with
   the help of statistical functions, such as average, maximum and minimum,
   for hundred and two-hundred iterations. Results show that an increasing
   number of agents can improve the average number of words found for both
   number of tested iterations. However, continuous increase in number of
   steps will not improve the results. Moreover, results of both iterations
   showed that the overall performance of the algorithm was not much
   improved by increasing the number of iterations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Given the availability of extensive digitized healthcare data
   from medical records, claims and prescription information, it is now
   possible to use hypothesis-free, data-driven approaches to mine medical
   databases for novel insight. The goal of this analysis was to
   demonstrate the use of artificial intelligence based methods such as
   Bayesian networks to open up opportunities for creation of new knowledge
   in management of chronic conditions.
   Materials and methods: Hospital level Medicare claims data containing
   discharge numbers for most common diagnoses were analyzed in a
   hypothesis-free manner using Bayesian networks learning methodology.
   Results: While many interactions identified between discharge rates of
   diagnoses using this data set are supported by current medical
   knowledge, a novel interaction linking asthma and renal failure was
   discovered. This interaction is non-obvious and had not been looked at
   by the research and clinical communities in epidemiological or clinical
   data. A plausible pharmacological explanation of this link is proposed
   together with a verification of the risk significance by conventional
   statistical analysis.
   Conclusion: Potential clinical and molecular pathways defining the
   relationship between commonly used asthma medications and renal disease
   are discussed. The study underscores the need for further
   epidemiological research to validate this novel hypothesis. Validation
   will lead to advancement in clinical treatment of asthma \& bronchitis,
   thereby, improving patient outcomes and leading to long term cost
   savings. In summary, this study demonstrates that application of
   advanced artificial intelligence methods in healthcare has the potential
   to enhance the quality of care by discovering non-obvious, clinically
   relevant relationships and enabling timely care intervention. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to develop a hybrid methodology that
   integrates machine learning algorithms with multi-criteria decision
   making (MCDM) techniques to effectively conduct multi-attribute
   inventory analysis. In the proposed methodology, first, ABC analyses
   using three different MCDM methods (i.e. simple-additive weighting,
   analytical hierarchy process, and VIKOR) are employed to determine the
   appropriate class for each of the inventory items. Following this, na ve
   Bayes, Bayesian network, artificial neural network (ANN), and support
   vector machine (SVM) algorithms are implemented to predict classes of
   initially determined stock items. Finally, the detailed prediction
   performance metrics of algorithms for each method are determined. The
   comprehensive case study executed at a large-scale automotive company
   revealed that the best classification accuracy is achieved by SVMs. The
   results also revealed that Bayesian networks, SVMs and ANNs are all
   capable of successfully dealing with the unbalanced data problems
   associated with Pareto distribution, and each of these algorithms
   performed well against all examined measures, thus validating the fact
   that machine learning algorithms are highly applicable to inventory
   classification problems. Therefore, this study presents uniqueness in
   that it is the first and foremost of its kind to effectively combine
   MCDM methods with machine learning algorithms in multi attribute
   inventory classification and is practically applicable in various
   inventory settings. Furthermore, this study also provides a
   comprehensive chronological overview of the existing literature of
   machine learning methods within inventory classification problems. (C)

Abstract = {{Big data mining, analysis, and forecasting always play a vital role in
   modern economic and industrial fields. Thus, how to select an
   optimization model to improve the forecasting accuracy of electricity
   price is not only an extremely challenging problem but also a concerned
   problem for different participants in an electricity market due to our
   society becoming heavily reliant on electricity. Many researchers
   developed hybrid models through the use of optimization methods,
   classical statistical models, artificial intelligence approaches and
   de-noising methods. However, few researchers aim to select reasonable
   samples and determine appropriate features when forecasting electricity
   price. Based on the Index of Bad Samples Matrix (IBSM), a novel method
   to dynamically confirm bad training samples, and the Optimization
   Algorithm (OA), DCANN and Updated DCANN are proposed in this paper for
   forecasting the day-ahead electricity price. This model is a hybrid
   system of supervised and unsupervised learning and creatively applies
   the idea of deleting bad samples and searching quality inputs to develop
   and learn, which is unlike BPANN, RBFN, SVM and LSSVM. Numerical results
   show that the proposed model is not only able to approximate the actual
   electricity price (normal or high volatility) but also an effective tool
   for h-step-ahead forecasting (his less than 10) compared to benchmarks.

Abstract = {{The use of artificial intelligence methods in different hydraulic
   sciences has become conventional in recent years. In this study, two
   artificial neural networks (ANN), namely multilayer perceptron (MLP) and

   (DT) and designed as two new hybrid models, namely DT-MLP and DT-RBF.
   The performance of the proposed hybrid (DT-MLP and DT-RBF) and simple
   (MLP and RBF) models was compared for velocity and water surface
   prediction in sharp 90 degrees bends. The experimental data for 5
   different hydraulic conditions in a sharp 90 degrees bend were used to
   train and test the models. In velocity prediction, the mean absolute
   error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and relative error (delta)
   values decreased with the DT-MLP model compared to the MLP model by
   16\%, 9\% and 0.17\% and the values of DT-RBF reduced by 11\%, 7\% and
   0.11\% compared to the RBF model, respectively. For water surface
   prediction, the MAE, RMSE and delta errors decreased with the DT-MLP
   model by 5.2\%, 5.5\% and 0.095\% compared with MLP and with the DT-RBF
   model the errors decreased by 20\%, 23\% and 0.5\% compared with RBF,

Abstract = {{The Steiner tree problem is a nondeterministic-polynomial-time-complete
   problem, so heuristic polynomial-time algorithms have been proposed for
   finding multicast trees. However, these polynomial-time algorithms'
   tree-cost optimality rates are not sufficient to obtain effective
   multicast trees, so intelligence algorithms, such as the genetic
   algorithm and artificial fish swarm algorithm, were proposed to improve
   previously proposed polynomial-time algorithms. However, these
   intelligence algorithms are time-consuming, even though they can reach
   quasi-optimal multicast trees. This paper proposes the multi-agent
   branch-based multicast (BBMC) algorithm, which can maintain the fast
   speed of polynomial-time algorithms while matching the tree-cost
   optimality of intelligence algorithms. The advantage of the proposed
   multi-agent BBMC algorithm is its covering of discarded effective branch
   candidates to seek the optimal multicast tree. By saving these branch
   candidates, the algorithm incurs tree-costs that are as small as those
   of intelligence algorithms, and by saving only a limited number of
   effective candidates, the algorithm is much faster than intelligence
   algorithms.}},

   Our results showed that the total classification accuracy of the CART is
   higher than that of SVM or logistic regression. 48.87\% of the Taiwanese
   public opposed nuclear power, 34.16\% supported nuclear power, and
   16.97\% did not respond to the question. However, the CART analysis
   showed that among the non-respondents, 56\% supported nuclear power and
   44\% opposed its use. The two primary factors influencing the opinion
   for nuclear power are ``satisfaction with the safety of nuclear
   power{''} and ``improvement in safety inspection and disaster prevention
   standards in nuclear power plants.{''} Therefore, by improving the
   safety of nuclear power plant, the government might regain public

Title = {{From handcrafted to learned representations for human action

Abstract = {{Human action recognition is an important branch among the studies of
   both human perception and computer vision systems. Along with the
   development of artificial intelligence, deep learning techniques have
   gained remarkable reputation when dealing with image categorization
   tasks (e.g., object detection and classification). However, since human
   actions normally present in the form of sequential image frames,
   analyzing human action data requires significantly increased
   computational power than still images when deep learning techniques are
   employed. Such a challenge has been the bottleneck for the migration of
   learning based image representation techniques to action sequences, so
   that the old fashioned handcrafted human action representations are
   still widely used for human action recognition tasks. On the other hand,
   since handcrafted representations are usually ad-hoc and overfit to
   specific data, they are incapable of being generalized to deal with
   various realistic scenarios. Consequently, resorting to deep learning
   action representations for human action recognition tasks is eventually
   a natural option. In this work, we provide a detailed overview of recent
   advancements in human action representations. As the first survey that
   covers both handcrafted and learning-based action representations, we
   explicitly discuss the superiorities and limitations of exiting
   techniques from both kinds. The ultimate goal of this survey is to
   provide comprehensive analysis and comparisons between learning-based
   and handcrafted action representations respectively, so as to inspire
   action recognition researchers towards the study of both kinds of
   representation techniques. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A recursive operations strategy model for managing sustainable chemical

Abstract = {{Sustainable consumption and production is a critical issue in the
   chemical industry due to increasing public concerns on environmental and
   safety issues. Organizations are urged to improve the quality of
   chemical products while minimizing the environmental impacts during
   production. In current practice, chemists and formulators have to
   determine both the ingredients to be used and the machine parameter
   settings during product development and production. Without appropriate
   operations strategies for managing sustainable consumption and
   production, a significant portion of the ingredients, toxic materials
   and pollutants are wasted or emitted during the trial-and-error
   processes when developing chemical products. In addition, inappropriate
   machine parameter settings, such as blending speed and blending
   temperature, result in inefficient energy use. Motivated by these
   issues, this paper describes a recursive operations strategy (ROS) model
   for achieving sustainable consumption and production in the chemical
   industry. The ROS model first identifies the business strategy, and then
   defines operations strategies by assessing the competitive priorities
   and policies with the use of artificial intelligence, including
   case-based reasoning and fuzzy logic, so as to manage the operations
   functions. The effectiveness of the model is verified by means of a case
   study. The results indicate that the model can provide direct guidelines
   for the users to develop products based on previously developed
   products. By so doing, the number of trials for testing various
   ingredient formulae can be reduced, minimizing the ingredient waste. The
   proposed model is also capable of achieving continuous improvement and
   determining the optimal production process conditions for avoiding
   unnecessary energy consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel approach for simulating pedestrian movement
   behavior based on artificial intelligence technology. Within this
   approach, a large volume of microscopic pedestrian movement behavior
   types were collected and encapsulated into an artificial neural network
   via network training. The trained network was then fed back into a
   simulation environment to predict the pedestrian movement. Two
   simulation experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the
   approach. First, a pedestrian-collision-avoidance test was conducted,
   and the results showed that virtual pedestrians with learned pedestrian
   behavior can move reasonably to avoid potential collisions with other
   pedestrians. In addition, a critical parameter, i.e., defined as
   ``reacting distance{''} and determined to be 2.5 m, represented the
   boundary of the collision buffer zone. Second, a pedestrian counterflow
   in a road-crossing situation was simulated, and the results were
   compared with the real-life scenario. The comparison revealed that the
   pedestrian distributions, erratic trajectories, and density-speed
   fundamental diagram in the simulation are reasonably consistent with the
   real-life scenario. Furthermore, a quantitative indicator, i.e., the
   relative distance error, was calculated to evaluate the simulation error
   of pedestrians' trajectories between the simulation and the real-life
   scenario, the mean of which was calculated to be 0.322. This revealed
   that the simulation results were acceptable from an engineering
   perspective, and they also showed that the approach could reproduce the
   lane-formation phenomenon. We considered the proposed approach to be
   capable of simulating human-like microscopic pedestrian flow.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional artificial methods and intelligence-based methods of

   adaptive deep convolution neural network based on an improved algorithm
   was proposed in this study, and its use to diagnose bearing faults and
   determine their severity was investigated. To test the effectiveness of
   the proposed method, an experiment was conducted with bearing-fault data
   samples obtained from a test rig. The method achieved a satisfactory
   performance in terms of both fault-pattern recognition and fault-size
   evaluation. In addition, comparison revealed that the improved algorithm

Abstract = {{Incorporating social relationship properties into forwarding schemes in
   opportunistic networks has become a more and more important paradigm.
   Communication among the nodes in an opportunistic network relies on
   intermittent contacts without complete end-to-end paths. Most of these
   forwarding schemes take advantage of social information such as contact
   information and social relationship among the nodes in the network. In
   this paper, we propose a social information based forwarding scheme in
   opportunistic networks through mimicking honey bees' behaviors in an
   artificial bee colony. In the proposed scheme, we adopt the percolation
   centrality in the social networks to assign certain nodes as
   ``influential{''} bees. The proposed forwarding scheme is aim at
   balancing the level between network traffic and transmission delay using
   the home-cell community-based mobility model (HCMM). Experiments were
   performed on the network simulator NS-2. The results show that the
   proposed scheme has outstanding performance for the level of network
   traffic and transmission delay in comparison to other schemes such as
   Epidemic, PRoPHET and SimBet when using the HCMM.}},

   large database of available high quality triaxial and direct shear tests
   on FRS documented in the literature from 1983 to 2015. The database
   includes information on the properties of sand, fibers, soil-fiber
   interface, and stress parameters. After data preprocessing, data mining
   technologies were employed to identify factors influencing shear
   strength and to predict the peak friction angle of FRS. The analysis
   techniques included (1)classification and regression methods,
   i.e.,linear regression (REG) analysis, classification and regression
   tree (CART) analysis, a generalized linear (GENLIN) model, and
   chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID); (2)machine
   learners, i.e.,artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector
   machine (SVM) and support vector regression (SVR); and (3)metaensemble
   models, i.e.,voting, bagging, stacking, and tiering. The analytical
   results indicated that fiber content, fiber aspect ratio, soil friction
   angle, and stress parameter had major effects on FRS shear strength. The
   optimal model obtained after further model training, cross-validation,
   and testing was the Tiering SVM-(SVR/SVR) method. The correlation
   coefficient (R) of the prediction values with the measured values in the
   database was 0.89, indicating a strong association. The mean absolute
   percentage error (MAPE) was 3.27\%, root mean square error (RMSE) was
   1.98 degrees, and mean absolute error (MAE) was 1.07 degrees. The
   overall improvement in performance measures was 9.31-79.50\%, which was
   comparable to that of other models reported in the literature. This
   study contributes to the domain knowledge by developing an effective
   artificial intelligence (AI) model for predicting the peak friction
   angle of FRS.}},

Abstract = {{At present time, although many theoretical formulations have been
   successfully proposed, there is a lack of ICT-based tools to support
   practical deployment of knowledge management (KM) in real settings. To
   bridge this gap, a hybrid artificial intelligence system is proposed in
   present study, aimed at gaining deeper knowledge about KM practices in
   four different economic sectors. By means of soft computing, companies
   are diagnosed according to their status regarding KM and subsequent
   explanations about crucial KM practices and perspectives are generated.
   Interesting conclusions are then derived from these explanations,
   allowing KM managers to optimise their decisions and obtain better
   results. Experimental results of real-life data from Spanish companies
   associated with different economic sectors validate the proposed
   combination of techniques.}},

Title = {{Hybrid Functional-Neural Approach for Surface Reconstruction}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new hybrid functional-neural approach for
   surface reconstruction. Our approach is based on the combination of two
   powerful artificial intelligence paradigms: on one hand, we apply the
   popular Kohonen neural network to address the data parameterization
   problem. On the other hand, we introduce a new functional network,
   called NURBS functional network, whose topology is aimed at reproducing
   faithfully the functional structure of the NURBS surfaces. These neural
   and functional networks are applied in an iterative fashion for further
   surface refinement. The hybridization of these two networks provides us
   with a powerful computational approach to obtain a NURBS fitting surface
   to a set of irregularly sampled noisy data points within a prescribed
   error threshold. The method has been applied to two illustrative
   examples. The experimental results confirm the good performance of our
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{The support vector machine (SVM) is a relatively new artificial
   intelligence technique which is increasingly being applied to
   geotechnical problems and is yielding encouraging results. In this paper
   SVM models are developed for predicting the ultimate axial load-carrying
   capacity of piles based on cone penetration test (CPT) data. A data set
   of 108 samples is used to develop the SVM models. These data were
   obtained from the literature containing pile load tests and each sample
   contains information regarding pile geometry, full-scale static pile
   load tests and CPT results. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is carried
   out to examine the relative significance of each input variable with
   respect to ultimate strength prediction. Finally, a statistical analysis
   is conducted to make comparisons between predictions obtained from the
   SVM models and three traditional CPT-based methods for determining pile
   capacity. The comparison confirms that the SVM models developed in this
   paper outperform the traditional methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Due to the inherent highly nonlinear vehicle state error dynamics
   obtained from low-cost inertial navigation system (INS) and Global
   Positioning System (GPS) along with the unknown statistical properties
   of these sensors, the optimality/accuracy of the classical Kalman filter
   for sensor fusion is not guaranteed. Therefore, in this paper, low-cost
   INS/GPS measurement integration is optimized based on different
   artificial intelligence (AI) techniques: Neural Networks (NN) and
   Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) architectures. The
   proposed approaches are aimed at achieving high-accuracy vehicle state
   estimates. The architectures utilize overlapping windows for delayed
   input signals. Both the NN approaches and the ANFIS approaches are used
   once with overlapping position windows as the input and once with
   overlapping position and velocity windows as the input. Experimental
   tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed AI
   approaches. The achieved accuracy is presented and discussed. The study
   finds that using ANFIS, with both position and velocity as input,
   provides the best estimates of position and velocity in the navigation
   system. Therefore, the dynamic input delayed ANFIS approach is further
   analyzed at the end of the paper. The effect of the input window size on
   the accuracy of state estimation is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The creation of intelligent video game controllers has recently become
   one of the greatest challenges in game artificial intelligence research,
   and it is arguably one of the fastest-growing areas in game design and
   development. The learning process, a very important feature of
   intelligent methods, is the result of an intelligent game controller to
   determine and control the game objects behaviors' or actions
   autonomously. Our approach is to use a more efficient learning model in
   the form of artificial neural networks for training the controllers. We
   propose a Hill-Climbing Neural Network (HillClimbNet) that controls the
   movement of the Ms. Pac-man agent to travel around the maze, gobble all
   of the pills and escape from the ghosts in the maze. HillClimbNet
   combines the hill-climbing strategy with a simple, feed-forward
   artificial neural network architecture. The aim of this study is to
   analyze the performance of various activation functions for the purpose
   of generating neural-based controllers to play a video game. Each
   non-linear activation function is applied identically for all the nodes
   in the network, namely log-sigmoid, logarithmic, hyperbolic
   tangent-sigmoid and Gaussian. In general, the results shows an optimum
   configuration is achieved by using log-sigmoid, while Gaussian is the
   worst activation function.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we present a self-organized method for allocating the
   individuals of a robot swarm to tasks that are sequentially
   interdependent. Tasks that are sequentially interdependent are common in
   natural and artificial systems. The proposed method does neither rely on
   global knowledge nor centralized components. Moreover, it does not
   require the robots to communicate. The method is based on the delay
   experienced by the robots working on one subtask when waiting for input
   from another subtask. We explore the capabilities of the method in
   different simulated environments. Additionally, we evaluate the method
   in a proof-of-concept experiment using real robots. We show that the
   method allows a swarm to reach a near-optimal allocation in the studied
   environments, can easily be transferred to a real robot setting, and is
   adaptive to changes in the properties of the tasks such as their
   duration. Finally, we show that the ideal setting of the parameters of
   the method does not depend on the properties of the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional intelligence is the ability to process information about one's
   own emotions and the emotions of others. It involves perceiving
   emotions, understanding emotions, managing emotions and using emotions
   in thought processes and in other activities. Emotion understanding is
   the cognitive activity of using emotions to infer why an agent is in an
   emotional state and which actions are associated with the emotional
   state. For humans, knowledge about emotions includes, in part, emotional
   experiences (episodic memory) and abstract knowledge about emotions
   (semantic memory). In accordance with the need for more sophisticated
   agents, the current research aims to increase the emotional intelligence
   of software agents by introducing and evaluating an emotion
   understanding framework for intelligent agents. The framework organizes
   the knowledge about emotions using episodic memory and semantic memory.
   Its episodic memory learns by storing specific details of emotional
   events experienced firsthand or observed. Its semantic memory is a
   lookup table of emotion-related facts combined with semantic graphs that
   learn through abstraction of additional relationships among emotions and
   actions from episodic memory. The framework is simulated in a
   multi-agent system in which agents attempt to elicit target emotions in
   other agents. They learn what events elicit emotions in other agents
   through interaction and observation. To evaluate the importance of
   different memory components, we run simulations with components
   ``lesioned{''}. We show that our framework outperformed Q-learning, a
   standard method for machine learning.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental factors, such as weather, trees, and animals, are major
   causes of power outages in electric utility distribution systems. Of

   proposes an ensemble learning approach based on a boosting algorithm,

   Effectiveness of the model is evaluated using actual data, which
   comprised of weather data and recorded outages for four cities of
   different sizes in Kansas. The proposed ensemble model is compared with
   previously presented regression, neural network, and mixture of experts

Title = {{Complexity-sensitive decision procedures for abstract argumentation}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{206}},
Pages = {{53-78}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide the basis for
   various reasoning problems in the area of Artificial Intelligence.
   Efficient evaluation of AFs has thus been identified as an important
   research challenge. So far, implemented systems for evaluating AFs have
   either followed a straight-forward reduction-based approach or been
   limited to certain tractable classes of AFs. In this work, we present a
   generic approach for reasoning over AFs, based on the novel concept of
   complexity-sensitivity. Establishing the theoretical foundations of this
   approach, we derive several new complexity results for preferred,
   semi-stable and stage semantics which complement the current complexity
   landscape for abstract argumentation, providing further understanding on
   the sources of intractability of AF reasoning problems. The introduced
   generic framework exploits decision procedures for problems of lower
   complexity whenever possible. This allows, in particular, instantiations
   of the generic framework via harnessing in an iterative way current
   sophisticated Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver technology for solving
   the considered AF reasoning problems. First experimental results show
   that the SAT-based instantiation of our novel approach outperforms
   existing systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the secondary structure of protein has been the focus of
   scientific research for decades, but it remains to be a challenge in
   bioinformatics due to the increasing computation complexity. In this
   paper, AB off-lattice model is introduced to transforms the prediction
   task into a numerical optimization problem. Artificial Bee Colony
   algorithm (ABC) is an effective swarm intelligence algorithm, which
   works well in exploration but poor at exploitation. To improve the
   convergence performance of ABC, a novel internal feedback strategy based
   ABC (IF-ABC) is proposed. In this strategy, internal states are fully
   used in each of the iterations to guide subsequent searching process,
   and to balance local exploration with global exploitation. We provide
   the mechanism together with the convergence proof of the modified
   algorithm. Simulations are conducted on artificial Fibonacci sequences
   and real sequences in the database of Protein Data Bank (PDB). The
   analysis implies that IF-ABC is more effective to improve convergence
   rate than ABC, and can be employed for this specific protein structure
   prediction issues. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Safe use of densely populated coastal zones depends on the performance
   of coastal structures against severe wave attack and strong currents.
   Economic and safe design of the crest height of these structures require
   accurate estimation of 2\% wave run-up value on breakwater slope.
   Although, in practice, regression-based approach is widely-used, it is
   demonstrated herein that a set of restrictive assumptions hinder its
   use. As an alternative, Mamdani Fuzzy Logic model suggested with no
   restrictive assumptions. Hence, the goal is to provide an alternative
   approach that is better than the regression-based approach at estimating
   2\% wave run-up level. In order to verify and compare the presented
   method's applicability, 261 irregular wave run-up data of Van der Meer
   and Stam are considered for impermeable, permeable and homogenous rubble
   mound structures. Finally, 13 unique prototype data of Van de Walle are
   employed to test the proposed model. It is demonstrated that Mamdani
   Fuzzy Logic model gives smaller error than the regression-based

Abstract = {{The existing anti-virus methods extract signatures of software by manual
   analysis. It is inefficient when they deal with a large number of

   found that the control flow of software can be divided into many basic

   approach based on this phenomenon is proposed. It can extract opcode
   sequences from the disassembled program, and translate them into
   features by vector space model. The algorithms of data mining are
   employed to find the classify rules from the software features, and then
   the rules can be applied to the malware detection. Experimental results
   illustrate that the proposed method can achieve the 97.0\% malware
   detection accuracy and 3.2\% false positive rate with the Random Forest

Abstract = {{Mobile malware has been growing in scale and complexity spurred by the

Title = {{Big Data and the SP Theory of Intelligence}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{301-315}},
Abstract = {{This paper is about how the SP theory of intelligence and its
   realization in the SP machine may, with advantage, be applied to the
   management and analysis of big data. The SP system-introduced in this
   paper and fully described elsewhere-may help to overcome the problem of
   variety in big data; it has potential as a universal framework for the
   representation and processing of diverse kinds of knowledge, helping to
   reduce the diversity of formalisms and formats for knowledge, and the
   different ways in which they are processed. It has strengths in the
   unsupervised learning or discovery of structure in data, in pattern
   recognition, in the parsing and production of natural language, in
   several kinds of reasoning, and more. It lends itself to the analysis of
   streaming data, helping to overcome the problem of velocity in big data.
   Central in the workings of the system is lossless compression of
   information: making big data smaller and reducing problems of storage
   and management. There is potential for substantial economies in the
   transmission of data, for big cuts in the use of energy in computing,
   for faster processing, and for smaller and lighter computers. The system
   provides a handle on the problem of veracity in big data, with potential
   to assist in the management of errors and uncertainties in data. It
   lends itself to the visualization of knowledge structures and
   inferential processes. A high-parallel, open-source version of the SP
   machine would provide a means for researchers everywhere to explore what
   can be done with the system and to create new versions of it.}},

Title = {{Autonomous Robots and the SP Theory of Intelligence ocr}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{1629-1651}},
Abstract = {{This paper is about how the SP theory of intelligence and its
   realization in the SP machine (both outlined in this paper) may help in
   the design of the brains of autonomous robots, meaning robots that do
   not depend on external intelligence or power supplies, are mobile, and
   have human-like versatility and adaptability in intelligence. This paper
   addresses three main problems: 1) how to increase the computational and
   energy efficiency of computers and to reduce their size and weight; 2)
   how to achieve human-like versatility in intelligence; and 3) likewise
   for human-like adaptability in intelligence. Regarding the first
   problem, the SP system has the potential for substantial gains in
   computational efficiency, with corresponding cuts in energy consumption
   and the bulkiness of computers: 1) by reducing the size of data to be
   processed; 2) by exploiting statistical information that the system
   gathers as an integral part of how it works; and 3) via a new version of
   Donald Hebb's concept of a cell assembly. Toward human-like versatility
   in intelligence, the SP system has strengths in unsupervised learning,
   natural language processing, pattern recognition, information retrieval,
   several kinds of reasoning, planning, problem solving, and more, with
   seamless integration among structures and functions. The SP system's
   strengths in unsupervised learning and other aspects of intelligence may
   help in achieving human-like adaptability in intelligence via: 1)
   one-trial learning; 2) learning of natural language; 3) learning to see;
   4) building 3-D models of objects and of a robot's surroundings; 5)
   learning regularities in the workings of a robot and in the robot's
   environment; 6) exploration and play; 7) learning major skills; and 8)
   learning via demonstration. Also discussed are how the SP system may
   process parallel streams of information, generalization of knowledge,
   correction of over-generalizations, learning from dirty data, how to cut
   the cost of learning, and reinforcements and motivations.}},

Abstract = {{During the centennial year of his birth Alan Turing (1912-1954) has been
   widely celebrated as having laid the foundations for Computer Science,
   Automated Decryption, Systems Biology and the Turing Test. In this paper
   we investigate Turing's motivations and expectations for the development
   of Machine Intelligence, as expressed in his 1950 article in Mind. We
   show that many of the trends and developments within AI over the last 50
   years were foreseen in this foundational paper. In particular, Turing
   not only describes the use of Computational Logic but also the necessity
   for the development of Machine Learning in order to achieve human-level
   AI within a 50 year time-frame. His description of the Child Machine (a
   machine which learns like an infant) dominates the closing section of
   the paper, in which he provides suggestions for how AI might be
   achieved. Turing discusses three alternative suggestions which can be
   characterised as: (1) AI by programming, (2) AI by ab initio machine
   learning and (3) AI using logic, probabilities, learning and background
   knowledge. He argues that there are inevitable limitations in the first
   two approaches and recommends the third as the most promising. We
   compare Turing's three alternatives to developments within AI, and
   conclude with a discussion of some of the unresolved challenges he posed
   within the paper.}},

Abstract = {{The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undergone many

   that paradigm shift by using the conceptual tools developed by Thomas
   Kuhn, and by analysing the contents of the longest running conference
   series in the field. A paradigm shift occurs when a new set of
   assumptions and values replaces the previous one within a given
   scientific community. These are often conveyed implicitly, by the choice
   of success stories that exemplify and define what a given field of
   research is about, demonstrating what kind of questions and answers are
   appropriate. The replacement of these exemplar stories corresponds to a
   shift in goals, methods, and expectations. We discuss the most recent
   such transition in the field of Artificial Intelligence, as well as

Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-51}},
Abstract = {{Artificial Intelligence is a brain child of Alan Turing and his
   universal programmable computer. During the 1960s and 1970s, AI
   researchers used computers for exploring intuitions about intelligence
   and for writing programs displaying intelligent behavior. A significant
   change occurred however in the 1980s, as many AI researchers moved from
   the early AI paradigm of writing programs for ill-defined problems to
   writing solvers for well-defined mathematical models like Constraint
   Satisfaction Problems, Strips Planning, SAT, Bayesian Networks,
   Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes and General Game Playing.
   Solvers are programs that take a compact description of a particular
   model instance and automatically compute its solution. Unlike the early
   AI programs, solvers are general as they must deal with any instance
   that fits the model. Many ideas have been advanced to address this crisp
   computational challenge from which a number of lessons can be drawn. In
   this paper, I revisit the problem of generality in AI, look at the way
   in which this `Models and Solvers' agenda addresses the problem, and
   discuss the relevance of this agenda to the grand AI goal of a
   computational account of intelligence and human cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a very strong synergy between Robotics and AI at their early
   beginning, the two fields progressed widely apart in the following
   decades. However, we are witnessing a revival of interest in the fertile
   domain of embodied machine intelligence. This is due in particular to
   the dissemination of more mature techniques from both areas, to more

   to a better understanding of the scientific challenges of the
   AI-Robotics intersection.
   The ambition of this paper is to contribute to this revival. It proposes
   an overview of problems and approaches to autonomous deliberate action
   in robotics. The paper advocates for a broad understanding of
   deliberation functions. It presents a synthetic perspective on planning,

Title = {{Delamination detection with error and noise polluted natural frequencies
   using computational intelligence concepts}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{906-925}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Delaminations are one of the most prevalent defects noticed in laminated
   composite structures. The existence of delaminations changes the
   vibration characteristics of laminates and hence such indicators can be
   used to quantify the health characteristics of laminates and detect
   potential risk of catastrophic failures. An approach for online health
   monitoring of in-service composite laminates is presented in this paper
   that relies on methods based on computational intelligence. Typical
   changes in the observed vibration characteristics (i.e. change in
   natural frequencies) are considered as inputs to identify the existence,
   location and magnitude of delaminations. The performance of the proposed
   approach is demonstrated using both numerical models and experimental
   studies of composite laminates. Since this identification problem
   essentially involves the solution of an optimization problem, the use of
   finite element (FE) methods as the underlying tool for analysis turns
   out to be computationally expensive. A surrogate assisted optimization
   approach is hence introduced to contain the computational time within
   affordable limits. An artificial neural network (ANN) model with
   Bayesian regularization is used as the underlying approximation scheme
   while an improved rate of convergence is achieved using a memetic
   algorithm. However, building of ANN surrogate models usually requires
   large training datasets. K-means clustering is effectively employed to
   reduce the size of datasets. ANN is also used for the solution of the
   inverse problem to determine the interface, size and location of
   delaminations using changes in measured natural frequencies before and
   after damage. The algorithms successfully performed delamination
   detection given limited amount of training datasets. Since in all
   practical problems, noise and error are inherently present, the
   performance of the proposed approach is also evaluated under varying
   levels of noise and error. The results clearly highlight the efficiency
   and the robustness of the approach. Hence, a delamination prediction
   strategy via K-means clustering, ANN and optimization algorithms
   integrated with surrogate models based on ANN for computational
   enhancement have been successfully developed and found efficient for
   detection of the interface of delamination, its size and location in FRP
   composite laminates using variations in natural frequencies. The
   developed algorithms are applied to composite beams. Results clearly
   indicate the delamination detection capability of the algorithms. The
   results demonstrate that the proposed techniques provide remarkable
   accurate detection of delamination damage with error and noise corrupted
   natural frequency validation data. The algorithms are quite promising,
   successful, flexible and practical with significant increase in terms of
   efficiency and effectiveness for SHM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Various methodologies of artificial intelligence have been recently used

   is described in this paper. Fuzzy logic model was constructed by use of
   the experience of contact area and contact pressure utilizing data
   obtained from series of experimentations in soil bin facility and a
   single-wheel tester. Two paramount tire parameters: wheel load and tire
   inflation pressure are the input variables for our model, each has five
   membership functions. As a fundamental aspect of the fuzzy logic based
   prediction systems, a set of fuzzy if-then rules were used in accordance
   with fuzzy logic principles. 25 linguistic if-then rules were included
   to develop a complicated highly intelligent predicting model based on
   Centroid method at defuzzification stage. The model performance was
   assessed on the basis of several statistical quality criteria. Mean
   relative error lower than 10\%, satisfactory scattering around

Abstract = {{The task of assigning geographic coordinates to textual resources plays
   an increasingly central role in geographic information retrieval. The
   ability to select those terms from a given collection that are most
   indicative of geographic location is of key importance in successfully
   addressing this task. However, this process of selecting spatially
   relevant terms is at present not well understood, and the majority of
   current systems are based on standard term selection techniques, such as
   chi(2) or information gain, and thus fail to exploit the spatial nature
   of the domain. In this paper, we propose two classes of term selection
   techniques based on standard geostatistical methods. First, to implement
   the idea of spatial smoothing of term occurrences, we investigate the
   use of kernel density estimation (KDE) to model each term as a
   two-dimensional probability distribution over the surface of the Earth.
   The second class of term selection methods we consider is based on
   Ripley's K statistic, which measures the deviation of a point set from
   spatial homogeneity. We provide experimental results which compare these
   classes of methods against existing baseline techniques on the tasks of
   assigning coordinates to Flickr photos and to Wikipedia articles,
   revealing marked improvements in cases where only a relatively small

Abstract = {{This paper describes the jCOLIBRI2 framework for building Case-based
   reasoning (CBR) systems. CBR is a mature subfield of artificial
   intelligence based on the reuse of previous problem solutions - cases -
   to solve new ones. However, up until now, it lacked a reference toolkit
   for developing such systems. jCOLIBRI2 aims to become that toolkit and
   to foster the collaboration among research groups. This software is the
   result of the experience collected over several years of framework
   development and evolution. This experience is explained in the paper,
   together with a description of the specialized CBR tools that can be
   implemented with jCOLIBRI: CBR with textual cases, recommenders,
   knowledge/data intensive applications or distributed architectures. (C)

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Different from warehouse, crossdock is considered as a ``JIT{''}
   technique in logistics and supply chain management (LSCM), which is
   usually a short period of time to store cargos. Since cargos transported
   to a crossdock by inbound trucks are immediately sorted out, repackaged,
   routed and loaded into outbound trucks and then delivered to customers
   within one day, one of the key issues to operate crossdock successfully
   is to develop an efficient truck-dock assignment module in the crossdock
   management system so that all the cargos can be delivered to customers
   on time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive tabu search (ATS)
   algorithm as an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to optimize the
   truck-dock assignment problem within a crossdock in a very efficient
   way, and computational experiments are conducted, showing that our
   approach dominates the CPLEX Solver in both effectiveness and
   efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{221-229}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This research examines the predictors of open interorganizational
   systems (IOS) adoption by using RosettaNet as a case study. The model
   used in this research derived its theoretical supports from literature
   related to interorganizational relationships and knowledge management
   studies. A sequential, multimethod approach integrating both structural
   equation modeling (SEM) and neural network analysis was employed in this
   research. Data was collected from 136 small and medium sized enterprises
   (SME). Our result showed that interorganizational relationships such as
   communication, collaboration and information sharing play an important
   role in SMEs' RosettaNet adoption decisions. Knowledge management
   practices such as knowledge application, knowledge acquisition and
   knowledge dissemination also influenced SMEs' decision to adopt
   RosettaNet. The findings are useful for decision makers to understand
   how they can improve the adoption of RosettaNet in their organizations.
   Unlike previous studies, this research provided additional insights into
   what influence the adoption of RosettaNet by examining variables beyond
   the traditional technological attributes which have been studied quite
   extensively. By integrating SEM with artificial intelligence techniques
   such as neural network, this study also examined the non-linear and
   non-compensatory relationships involved in the adoption of RosettaNet.

Abstract = {{In recent years, harmonic pollution has worried the power engineers
   considerably due to the increased penetration of power-electronics-based
   devices in the utility grid. Monitoring of certain low-order harmonics
   in the power supply is more important than monitoring of the entire
   spectrum because, usually, these are the most significant ones. In this
   paper, a technique based on an adaptive wavelet neural network that is
   the most suitable for dominant low-order harmonic estimation is
   presented. The proposed method works with only half-cycle data point
   inputs, compared to the requirement of at least one-complete-cycle data
   for other estimation techniques. A simple, fast converging, and reliable
   learning algorithm based on back propagation is used for training of the
   network parameters. The proposed method is examined with a number of
   simulated and experimental signals. The test results confirm that the
   proposed method accurately estimates the dominant low-order harmonics in
   pragmatic situations of fundamental frequency deviation, presence of
   interharmonics, low signal-to-noise ratio, etc.}},

   an active area of research with a significant relevance to several

   Approaches based on some artificial intelligence implementations, like

   solution to perform a suitable classification among several weld
   perturbations. The search for an optimal configuration of the algorithm
   and the usefulness of both spatial (spectral) and temporal
   identification of patterns will be also discussed, and the results will
   be compared with those provided by a solution based on feature selection

Abstract = {{Social Networks (SN) is an increasingly popular topic in artificial
   intelligence research. One of the key directions is to model and study
   the behaviors of social agents. In this paper, we propose a new
   computational model which can serve as a powerful tool for the analysis
   of SN. Specifically, we add to the traditional sociometric methods a
   novel analytical method in order to deal with social behaviors more
   effectively, and then present a new bio-inspired model, the coordination
   generalized molecule model (CGMM). The proposed analytical method for
   social behaviors and CGMM are combined to give an algorithm that can be
   used to solve complex problems in SN. Traditionally, SN models were
   mainly descriptive and were built at a very coarse level, typically with
   only a few global parameters, and turned out to be not sufficiently
   useful for analyzing social behaviors. In this work, we explore

Abstract = {{Several emotion eliciting models have been proposed in the literature,
   however most of them are still artificial models which ignore the
   biological basis. We propose an emotion (without awareness) eliciting
   model from visual stimuli, which is inspired by biology: we describe an
   emotion eliciting process that follows the circuits of emotion in the
   brain derived through the results of neuroscience and the three major
   modules in the process, visual perception, emotion-eliciting region and
   emotional valence elicited by the region, are all supported by biology
   research. In our work, visual perception works with visual stimuli from
   coarse to the finer level according to human visual system. The elicited
   emotion in coarse level is also capable of affecting the emotion valence
   in the finer level. Based on psychophysical research, the
   emotion-eliciting region is selected out through color preference. The
   emotion is elicited by the emotion-eliciting region rather than overall
   visual context, which has been first introduced to computational
   modeling of emotion eliciting from image stimuli. The emotional valence
   elicited by the region is calculated on coarseness and directionality by
   comparing with stored image representations. In the experiments, two
   types of visual stimuli are considered: (1) natural scenes stimuli and
   (2) natural scenes and mutilation scenes stimuli. We compare the
   performance of our model with International Affective Picture System
   (IAPS), a large set of emotionally evocative color photographs that
   includes pleasure and arousal ratings made by men and women.
   Experimental results show that our model can generate human-like emotion
   based on natural scenes stimuli and obtain the positive or negative
   emotion as people feel on natural scenes and mutilation scenes stimuli.

Abstract = {{Clustering algorithms have been widely used artificial intelligence,
   data mining and machine learning, etc. It is unsupervised classification
   and is divided into groups according to data sets. That is, the data
   sets of similarity partition belong to the same group; otherwise data
   sets divide other groups in the clustering algorithms. In general, to
   analysis interval data needs Type II fuzzy logical. Therefore, the
   interval fuzzy c-means clustering method was proposed to deal with
   symbolic interval data. However, it still has noisy and outliers
   problems on these symbolic interval data. Hence, we propose Hausdorff
   distance measure based interval fuzzy possibilistic c-means clustering
   algorithm to overcome the interval fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm
   for the symbolic interval data clustering in noisy and outlier
   environments. From the simulation results, the proposed Hausdorff

Abstract = {{Various computational intelligence techniques have been used in the
   prediction of petroleum reservoir properties. However, each of them has
   its limitations depending on different conditions such as data size and
   dimensionality. Hybrid computational intelligence has been introduced as
   a new paradigm to complement the weaknesses of one technique with the
   strengths of another or others. This paper presents a computational
   intelligence hybrid model to overcome some of the limitations of the
   standalone type-2 fuzzy logic system (T2FLS) model by using a
   least-square-fitting-based model selection algorithm to reduce the
   dimensionality of the input data while selecting the best variables.
   This novel feature selection procedure resulted in the improvement of
   the performance of T2FLS whose complexity is usually increased and
   performance degraded with increased dimensionality of input data. The
   iterative least-square-fitting algorithm part of functional networks
   (FN) and T2FLS techniques were combined in a hybrid manner to predict
   the porosity and permeability of North American and Middle Eastern oil
   and gas reservoirs. Training and testing the T2FLS block of the hybrid
   model with the best and dimensionally reduced input variables caused the
   hybrid model to perform better with higher correlation coefficients,
   lower root mean square errors, and less execution times than the
   standalone T2FLS model. This work has demonstrated the promising
   capability of hybrid modelling and has given more insight into the
   possibility of more robust hybrid models with better functionality and
   capability indices.}},

Abstract = {{A rule-based Mamdani max-min fuzzy expert system for prediction of
   coefficient of motion resistance (CMR) is presented. Owing to nonlinear
   characteristic of soil-wheel interactions, application of fuzzy
   rule-based models for determination of CMR is instrumental. We were
   encouraged to apply fuzzy logic approach for the modeling by use of the
   experience of induced CMR as affected by tire inflation pressure,
   velocity, and wheel load to be practically applicable with wide range of
   unknown nonlinear systems. Employment of fuzzy if-then true rules makes
   it possible to handle ill-defined and nonlinear arrangements and gives
   higher privilege over conventional methods. Therefore, of aforementioned
   rules, 27 if-then true rules were incorporated to develop a
   sophisticated highly intelligent representation based on centroid method
   for defuzzification stage preceded by Mamdani max-min inference
   supposition. The model performance was evaluated on the basis of various
   statistical criteria and also was compared to a conventional model. Mean
   relative error lower than 10 \%, good scattering around line (1: 1), and
   high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 99 \%) obtained by the fuzzy
   logics model are confirmed.}},

Title = {{Swarm Intelligence Based Self-organizing QoS Framework for Ever-changing
   Future Networks}},

Abstract = {{We consider a new QoS framework for a wide range of multimedia services
   in ever-changing networks where traffic is dynamic and network
   topologies frequently change. In this paper, for such networks, we
   propose a new self-organizing QoS framework called AntQoS, which is
   inspired by recent works on ant colony optimization. Compared with
   previous QoS frameworks, AntQoS provides two quite promising
   capabilities: 1) the self-organized network QoS (not pre-defined QoS),
   which autonomously reconfigures itself by promptly adapting to changing
   network environments such as sudden arrivals of highly bursty traffic,
   and 2) the self-organized network controls, which autonomously resolve
   the network congestion and intrinsically resist the multiple network
   failures. These two promising capabilities enable the proposed AntQoS
   framework to efficiently and reliably support a wide range of multimedia
   services with various quality demands. Especially, these capabilities
   are provided by making use of swarm intelligence of artificial ants
   without any supervised control.
   For this purpose, AntQoS employs one single artificial ant colony on an
   ever-changing network; a number of artificial ants in the employed
   colony explore network and measure or gather the status information
   about the networks. Based on the gathered information, AntQoS organizes
   and maintains a small number of virtual sub colonies named QoS colonies.
   The QoS colony is an intelligent virtual colony to be capable of
   searching the path which guarantees the given quality demands of flows.
   In addition, it is autonomously generated, maintained, and deleted for
   promptly adapting to the ever-changing network status. Simulation
   results demonstrate that AntQoS successfully supports various multimedia
   services with diverse delay requirements while increasing the network
   throughput by approximately 20\% compared to the well-known IntServ
   frameworks. Simulation results also show that AntQoS autonomously
   redistributes the congested traffic and resists the unexpected network
   failures.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increasing competitiveness in shopping environments,
   profiling consumers becomes critical for retailers and their managers.
   However, researchers investigated the consumer profiling based on either
   the shopping motivations, or the shopping values, or the consumers'
   decision making styles separately mostly by using K-means clustering
   method in the literature. In this sense, a research investigating the
   shopping motivations and values, and consumers' decision making styles
   together with a new clustering method, which overcomes the limitations
   of the K-means clustering method, is warranted in the literature. In
   this study, we used an Artificial Intelligence based technique, called
   Self Organizing Map (SOM), to profile consumers based upon their
   shopping motivations and values, and decision making styles. Our results
   also demonstrated that SOM's total within cluster variance is smaller
   than K-means's, indicating that SOM clustering is better than the
   K-means when the sample is non-normally distributed. The paper profiles
   clusters on demographics and ethnic group membership to examine
   similarities and differences among cluster members.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is to learn the daily activity engagement
   patterns of travelers using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a modeling
   approach that is widely used in Artificial intelligence and Machine
   Learning. It is postulated that an individual's choice of activities
   depends not only on socio-demographic characteristics but also on
   previous activities of individual on the same day. In the paper, Markov
   Chain models are used to study the sequential choice of activities. The
   dependencies among activity type, activity sequence and
   socio-demographic data are captured by employing hidden Markov models.
   In order to learn model parameters, we use sequential multinomial logit
   models (MNL) and multi-class Support Vector Machines (K-SVM) with two
   different dependency structures. In the first dependency structure, it
   is assumed that type of activity at time `t' depends on the last
   previous activity and socio-demographic data, whereas in the second
   structure we assume that activity selection at time `t' depends on all
   of the individual's previous activity types on the same day and
   socio-demographic characteristics. The models are applied to data drawn
   from a set of California households and a comparison of the accuracy of
   estimation of activity types and their sequence in the agenda, indicates
   the superiority of K-SVM models over MNL. Additionally, we show that
   accuracy in estimating activity patterns increases using different sets
   of explanatory variables or tuning parameters of the kernel function in
   K-SVM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are membrane proteins

   haematological malignancies, viral infections and autoimmune diseases.
   Molecular epidemiology studies employ traditional statistical methods to

   results at applying artificial intelligence algorithms (support vector
   machines) to identify associations between KIR genes and disease. We
   demonstrate that these algorithms are capable of classifying samples

Abstract = {{In this survey article, we give an overview of methods for music
   similarity estimation and music recommendation based on music context
   data. Unlike approaches that rely on music content and have been
   researched for almost two decades, music-context-based (or contextual)
   approaches to music retrieval are a quite recent field of research
   within music information retrieval (MIR). Contextual data refers to all
   music-relevant information that is not included in the audio signal
   itself. In this article, we focus on contextual aspects of music
   primarily accessible through web technology. We discuss different
   sources of context-based data for individual music pieces and for music
   artists. We summarize various approaches for constructing similarity
   measures based on the collaborative or cultural knowledge incorporated
   into these data sources. In particular, we identify and review three
   main types of context-based similarity approaches: text-retrieval-based
   approaches (relying on web-texts, tags, or lyrics), co-occurrence-based
   approaches (relying on playlists, page counts, microblogs, or
   peer-to-peer-networks), and approaches based on user ratings or
   listening habits. This article elaborates the characteristics of the
   presented context-based measures and discusses their strengths as well
   as their weaknesses.

Abstract = {{Several multimedia applications need to reason with concepts and their
   media properties in specific domain contexts. Media properties of
   concepts exhibit some unique characteristics that cannot be dealt with
   conceptual modeling schemes followed in the existing ontology
   representation and reasoning schemes. We have proposed a new perceptual
   modeling technique for reasoning with media properties observed in
   multimedia instances and the latent concepts. Our knowledge
   representation scheme uses a causal model of the world where concepts
   manifest in media properties with uncertainties. We introduce a
   probabilistic reasoning scheme for belief propagation across domain
   concepts through observation of media properties. In order to support
   the perceptual modeling and reasoning paradigm, we propose a new
   ontology language, Multimedia Web Ontology Language (MOWL). Our primary
   contribution in this article is to establish the need for the new
   ontology language and to introduce the semantics of its novel language
   constructs. We establish the generality of our approach with two
   disperate knowledge-intensive applications involving reasoning with
   media properties of concepts.

Abstract = {{The development of vision-based human activity recognition and analysis
   systems has been a matter of great interest to both the research
   community and practitioners during the last 20 years. Traditional
   methods that require a human operator watching raw video streams are
   nowadays deemed as at least ineffective and expensive. New, smart
   solutions in automatic surveillance and monitoring have emerged,
   propelled by significant technological advances in the fields of image
   processing, artificial intelligence, electronics and optics, embedded
   computing and networking, molding the future of several applications
   that can benefit from them, like security and healthcare. The main
   motivation behind it is to exploit the highly informative visual data
   captured by cameras and perform high-level inference in an automatic,
   ubiquitous and unobtrusive manner, so as to aid human operators, or even
   replace them. This survey attempts to comprehensively review the current
   research and development on vision-based human activity recognition.
   Synopses from various methodologies are presented in an effort to garner
   the advantages and shortcomings of the most recent state-of-the-art
   technologies. Also a first-level self-evaluation of methodologies is
   also proposed, which incorporates a set of significant features that
   best describe the most important aspects of each methodology in terms of
   operation, performance and others and weighted by their importance. The
   purpose of this study is to serve as a reference for further research
   and evaluation to raise thoughts and discussions for future improvements
   of each methodology towards maturity and usefulness.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, we have proposed a two-layered approach to compute a
   winning strategy for the game of Billiards. AI tools as well as robust
   optimization routines for noisy environments were combined to plan the
   sequence of shots. We complete the modeling here by introducing
   significant developments for the high-level planner which guides the
   precise optimal controller to generate a plan given at any random
   initial state. We will first resume the general model for this
   particular class of problems and then propose several domain-specific
   heuristics to guide our search and render the problem tractable. Several
   improvements to the optimal robust controller, including refinements in
   the objective function, will also be presented in order to improve
   single-shot optimization. Results are presented demonstrating the full
   potential of the methods proposed making it the state of the art in
   regards to the game of Billiards.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a search paradigm that has been
   remarkably successful in computer games like Go. It uses Monte Carlo
   simulation to evaluate the values of nodes in a search tree. The node
   values are then used to select the actions during subsequent
   simulations. The performance of MCTS heavily depends on the quality of
   its default policy, which guides the simulations beyond the search tree.
   In this paper, we propose an MCTS improvement, called incentive
   learning, which learns the default policy online. This new default
   policy learning scheme is based on ideas from combinatorial game theory,
   and hence is particularly useful when the underlying game is a sum of
   games. To illustrate the efficiency of incentive learning, we describe a
   game named Heap-Go and present experimental results on the game.}},

Abstract = {{Condition assessment for power transformer requires not only integrating
   the known artificial intelligence (AI) technology, but also exploiting
   the interrelation of the measured data. According to the association
   rule of information data and the variable weight synthesizing theory of
   factor spaces, an assessment method of transformer condition was
   proposed in this paper. Via analyzing the interrelation of the
   independent status parameters (ISP) and transformer fault types, the set
   of synthetic status parameters (SSP) can be built up. For avoiding
   interference from subjective experience, association rule theory was
   used to calculate the constant weight coefficients (CWC) of the ISPs.
   Since the true transformer condition may not always be accurately
   reflected under the condition of CWCs of a few SSPs, the method of
   variable weight synthesizing was used for computing the variable weight
   coefficients (VWC) of the SSPs. Then, combining with the existing
   maintenance procedures, a preferable condition assessing system of power
   transformer was proposed. Operational example proved the condition
   assessing system may reflect the real operation condition of power
   transformer.}},

Abstract = {{Software quality is one of the most important factors for assessing the
   global competitive position of any software company. Thus, the
   quantification of the quality parameters and integrating them into the
   quality models is very essential.Many attempts have been made to
   precisely quantify the software quality parameters using various models
   such as Boehm's Model, McCall's Model and ISO/IEC 9126 Quality Model. A
   major challenge, although, is that effective quality models should
   consider two types of knowledge: imprecise linguistic knowledge from the
   experts and precise numerical knowledge from historical
   data.Incorporating the experts' knowledge poses a constraint on the
   quality model; the model has to be transparent.In this study, the
   authorspropose a process for developing fuzzy logic-based transparent

Abstract = {{Metaphor makes our thoughts more vivid and fills our communication with
   richer imagery. Furthermore, according to the conceptual metaphor theory
   (CMT) of Lakoff and Johnson (Metaphors we live by. University of Chicago
   Press, Chicago, 1980), metaphor also plays an important structural role
   in the organization and processing of conceptual knowledge. According to
   this account, the phenomenon of metaphor is not restricted to
   similarity-based extensions of meanings of individual words, but instead
   involves activating fixed mappings that reconceptualize one whole area
   of experience in terms of another. CMT produced a significant resonance
   in the fields of philosophy, linguistics, cognitive science and
   artificial intelligence and still underlies a large proportion of modern
   research on metaphor. However, there has to date been no comprehensive
   corpus-based study of conceptual metaphor, which would provide an
   empirical basis for evaluating the CMT using real-world linguistic data.
   The annotation scheme and the empirical study we present in this paper
   is a step towards filling this gap. We test our annotation procedure in
   an experimental setting involving multiple annotators and estimate their
   agreement on the task. The goal of the study is to investigate (1) how
   intuitive the conceptual metaphor explanation of linguistic metaphors is
   for human annotators and whether it is possible to consistently annotate
   interconceptual mappings; (2) what are the main difficulties that the
   annotators experience during the annotation process; (3) whether one
   conceptual metaphor is sufficient to explain a linguistic metaphor or
   whether a chain of conceptual metaphors is needed. The resulting corpus
   annotated for conceptual mappings provides a new, valuable dataset for
   linguistic, computational and cognitive experiments on metaphor.}},

Abstract = {{Teaching artistic skills to children presents a unique challenge:
   High-level creative and social elements of an artistic discipline are
   often the most engaging and the most likely to sustain student
   enthusiasm, but these skills rely on low-level sensorimotor
   capabilities, and in some cases rote knowledge, which are often tedious
   to develop. We hypothesize that computer-based learning can play a
   critical role in connecting ``bottom-up{''} (sensorimotor-first)
   learning in the arts to ``top-down{''} (creativity-first) learning, by
   employing machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques that
   can play the role of the sensorimotor expert. This approach allows
   learners to experience components of higher-level creativity and social
   interaction even before developing the prerequisite sensorimotor skills

Abstract = {{Transport network is a key factor of economic, social and every other

   conditions for transport network development is the construction of new

   design and construction in urban areas is quite limited. The process of
   analysis and planning the new roads is a complex process that depends on
   many factors (the physical characteristics of the terrain, the economic
   situation, political decisions, environmental impact, etc) and can take
   several months. These factors directly or indirectly affect the final
   solution, and in combination with project limitations and requirements,
   sometimes can be mutually opposed In this paper, we present one software
   solution that aims to find Pareto optimal path for preliminary design of
   the new roadway. The proposed algorithm is based on many different
   factors (physical and social) with the ability of their increase. This
   solution is implemented using Hopfield's neural network, as a kind of

Abstract = {{Predicting the cycle time of each job in a factory is an important task
   to the factory. However, it is not easy to deal with the uncertainty in
   the job cycle time. To cope with this problem and to effectively predict
   the job cycle time, an effective fuzzy collaborative forecasting
   approach is proposed in this study. The main difference between the
   proposed methodology and the existing methods is that the proposed
   methodology generates a fuzzy cycle time forecast in an effective way.
   In addition, the proposed method utilizes each round of fuzzy artificial
   neural network training to generate the upper and lower bounds of the
   job cycle time. The upper and lower bounds then serve as the basis for
   the subsequent collaboration. We collected the data of 120 jobs from a
   wafer fabrication factory to assess the effectiveness of the proposed
   method. The analysis results showed that the proposed fuzzy
   collaborative forecasting approach was indeed more efficient and
   accurate than some existing methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm to solve the
   cyclic antibandwidth problem. This hard optimization problem consists of
   embedding an n-vertex graph into the cycle C-n, such that the minimum
   distance (measured in the cycle) of adjacent vertices is maximized. It
   constitutes a natural extension of the well-known antibandwidth problem,
   and can be viewed as the dual problem of the cyclic bandwidth problem.
   Our method hybridizes the artificial bee colony methodology with tabu
   search to obtain high-quality solutions in short computational times.
   Artificial bee colony is a recent swarm intelligence technique based on
   the intelligent foraging behavior of honeybees. The performance of this
   algorithm is basically determined by two search strategies, an
   initialization scheme that is employed to construct initial solutions
   and a method for generating neighboring solutions. On the other hand,
   tabu search is an adaptive memory programming methodology introduced in
   the eighties to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems. Our
   hybrid approach adapts some elements of both methodologies, artificial
   bee colony and tabu search, to the cyclic antibandwidth problem. In
   addition, it incorporates a fast local search procedure to enhance the
   local intensification capability. Through the analysis of experimental
   results, the highly effective performance of the proposed algorithm is
   shown with respect to the current state-of-the-art algorithm for this
   problem. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The high resolution of digital cameras has made single-shot,

   design effort is still necessary in order to construct the necessary
   collection of optical elements for particular acquisition scenarios.
   This paper explores a pipeline for designing, fabricating and utilizing
   faceted mirror arrays which simplifies this task. The foundation of the
   pipeline is an interactive tool that automatically optimizes for mirror
   designs while exposing to the user a set of intuitive parameters for
   light field quality and manufacturing constraints. We investigate two
   manufacturing processes for automatic fabrication of the resulting
   designs: one is based on CNC milling, polishing, and plating of one
   solid work piece, while the other involves assembly of CNC-cut mirror
   facets. We demonstrate results for refocusing in a macro photography
   scenario. In addition, we observe that traditional photographic
   parameters take novel roles in the faceted mirror array setup and
   discuss their influence.}},

Abstract = {{Human hand recognition plays an important role in a wide range of
   applications ranging from sign language translators, gesture
   recognition, augmented reality, surveillance and medical image
   processing to various Human Computer Interaction (HCI) domains. Human
   hand is a complex articulated object consisting of many connected parts
   and joints. Therefore, for applications that involve HCI one can find
   many challenges to establish a system with high detection and
   recognition accuracy for hand posture and/or gesture. Hand posture is
   defined as a static hand configuration without any movement involved.
   Meanwhile, hand gesture is a sequence of hand postures connected by
   continuous motions. During the past decades, many approaches have been
   presented for hand posture and/or gesture recognition. In this paper, we
   provide a survey on approaches which are based on Hidden Markov Models

Abstract = {{Adaptive neural network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is an

   been generated directly from the experimental data using ANFIS. The
   performance of the proposed model is validated by comparing the
   predicted results with the actual practical results obtained by
   conducting the confirmation experiments. The application of chi (2) test
   confirms that the values of tensile strength predicted by proposed ANFIS

Abstract = {{Recorded time series of relative humidity (RH) are modeled by using
   genetic expression programming (GEP) and artificial neural networks
   (ANNs) models. The data are noisy and contain missing datapoints. RH is
   modeled as a function of three meteorological variables: temperature,
   wind speed, and pressure. Various model structures of both of these
   models are investigated with the aim of testing the robustness of the
   predicted values in the presence of noise and missing data. Due to the
   presence of noise, a sophisticated treatment of missing data was not
   justifiable, and therefore, the strategy adopted was just to carry the
   datapoints backward, although this may induce bias in the time dimension
   and contaminate the predicted results. The results of this study
   indicate that through a careful selection of model structures both GEP
   and ANN can produce adequately reliable prediction of RH values 1 year
   into the future. The paper provides evidence that this model structure
   is feasible when the dependent variables include both the present and
   past values.}},

Abstract = {{Concrete is a composite construction material made primarily with
   aggregate, cement, and water. In addition to the basic ingredients used
   in conventional concrete, high-performance concrete incorporates
   supplementary cementitious materials, such as fly ash and blast furnace
   slag, and chemical admixture, such as superplasticizer. Hence,
   high-performance concrete is a highly complex material and modeling its
   behavior represents a difficult task. In this paper, we propose an
   intelligent system based on Genetic Programming for the prediction of
   high-performance concrete strength. The system we propose is called
   Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming, and it is based on recently
   defined geometric semantic genetic operators for Genetic Programming.
   Experimental results show the suitability of the proposed system for the
   prediction of concrete strength. In particular, the new method provides
   significantly better results than the ones produced by standard Genetic
   Programming and other machine learning methods, both on training and on
   out-of-sample data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Valid-time indeterminacy is ``don't know when{''} indeterminacy, coping
   with cases in which one does not exactly know when a fact holds in the
   modeled reality. In this paper, we first propose a reference
   representation (data model and algebra) in which all possible temporal
   scenarios induced by valid-time indeterminacy can be extensionally
   modeled. We then specify a family of 16 more compact representational
   data models. We demonstrate their correctness with respect to the
   reference representation and analyze several properties, including their
   data expressiveness. Then, we compare these compact models along several
   relevant dimensions. Finally, we also extend the reference
   representation and a representative of compact representations to cope
   with probabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Linguistic Geometry (LG) is a type of game theory for extensive discrete
   games scalable to the level of real life defense systems. This
   scalability is based on changing the paradigm for game solving-from
   search to construction. LG was developed by generalizing experiences of
   the advanced chess players. LG is a formal model of human reasoning
   about armed conflict, a mental reality ``hard-wired{''} in the human
   brain. It appears that this algorithm, an evolutionary product of
   millions of years of human warfare, served in its turn as the principle
   mover for evolution of human intelligence. Its special role in human
   history and its relationship to the Primary Language of the human brain
   (as introduced by J. Von Neumann) suggest that the experiences of
   development of LG must be instructive for solving another major puzzle,
   discovering the Algorithm of Discovery. This algorithm should be an
   ancient component of the Primary Language as well. This paper refining
   our experiences of discovering LG reports the first results of this

Title = {{A new measure for gene expression biclustering based on non-parametric
   correlation}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{367-397}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: One of the emerging techniques for performing the analysis
   of the DNA microarray data known as biclustering is the search of
   subsets of genes and conditions which are coherently expressed. These
   subgroups provide clues about the main biological processes. Until now,
   different approaches to this problem have been proposed. Most of them
   use the mean squared residue as quality measure but relevant and
   interesting patterns can not be detected such as shifting, or scaling
   patterns. Furthermore, recent papers show that there exist new coherence
   patterns involved in different kinds of cancer and tumors such as
   inverse relationships between genes which can not be captured.
   Results: The proposed measure is called Spearman's biclustering measure
   (SBM) which performs an estimation of the quality of a bicluster based
   on the non-linear correlation among genes and conditions simultaneously.
   The search of biclusters is performed by using a evolutionary technique
   called estimation of distribution algorithms which uses the SBM measure
   as fitness function. This approach has been examined from different
   points of view by using artificial and real microarrays. The assessment
   process has involved the use of quality indexes, a set of bicluster
   patterns of reference including new patterns and a set of statistical
   tests. It has been also examined the performance using real microarrays
   and comparing to different algorithmic approaches such as Bimax, CC,
   OPSM, Plaid and xMotifs. Conclusions: SBM shows several advantages such
   as the ability to recognize more complex coherence patterns such as
   shifting, scaling and inversion and the capability to selectively
   marginalize genes and conditions depending on the statistical
   significance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An improved method of early diagnosis of smoking-induced respiratory

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{112}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop an automatic classifier to
   increase the accuracy of the forced oscillation technique (FOT) for
   diagnosing early respiratory abnormalities in smoking patients. The data
   consisted of FOT parameters obtained from 56 volunteers, 28 healthy and
   28 smokers with low tobacco consumption. Many supervised learning
   techniques were investigated, including logistic linear classifiers, k
   nearest neighbor (KNN), neural networks and support vector machines
   (SVM). To evaluate performance, the ROC curve of the most accurate
   parameter was established as baseline. To determine the best input
   features and classifier parameters, we used genetic algorithms and a
   10-fold crossvalidation using the average area under the ROC curve
   (AUC). In the first experiment, the original FOT parameters were used as
   input. We observed a significant improvement in accuracy (KNN= 0.89 and
   SVM= 0.87) compared with the baseline (0.77). The second experiment
   performed a feature selection on the original FOT parameters. This
   selection did not cause any significant improvement in accuracy, but it
   was useful in identifying more adequate FOT parameters. In the third
   experiment, we performed a feature selection on the cross products of
   the FOT parameters. This selection resulted in a further increase in AUC
   (KNN= SVM= 0.91), which allows for high diagnostic accuracy. In
   conclusion, machine learning classifiers can help identify early
   smoking-induced respiratory alterations. The use of FOT cross products
   and the search for the best features and classifier parameters can
   markedly improve the performance of machine learning classifiers. (C)

   This paper explains and discusses thoroughly about various existent
   strategies for setting PSO parameters, provides some hints for its
   parameter setting and presents some proposals for future research on
   this area. There exists no other paper in literature that discusses the
   setting process for all PSO parameters. Using the guidelines of this

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new tool wear monitoring method based on auto
   associative neural network. The main advantage of the model lies that it
   can be built only by the data under normal cutting condition. Therefore,
   the training samples of the tool wear status are no longer needed during
   the training process that makes it easier to be applied in real
   industrial environment than other neural network models. An averaged
   distance indicator is proposed to denote not only the occurrence of the
   tool wear but also its severity. Moreover, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM)
   training algorithm is introduced to improve the convergence accuracy of
   the auto associative neural network. Based on the proposed method, a
   framework for online tool condition monitoring is illustrated and the
   cutting force data under different tool wear status are collected to
   simulate the online modeling and monitoring process for the rough and
   finish milling respectively. The results show that the proposed
   indicator can reflect the evolution process of tool wear correctly and
   the LM algorithm is more accurate in comparison with the gradient
   descent methods. Therefore, it casts new light on practical application
   of neural network in the field of on line tool condition monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of upstream stations' flow records
   on the performance of artificial neural network (ANN) models for
   predicting daily watershed runoff. As a comparison, a multiple linear
   regression (MLR) analysis was also examined using various statistical
   indices. Five streamflow measuring stations on the Cahaba River,
   Alabama, were selected as case studies. Two different ANN models, multi
   layer feed forward neural network using Levenberg-Marquardt learning
   algorithm (LMFF) and radial basis function (RBF), were introduced in
   this paper. These models were then used to forecast one day ahead
   streamflows. The correlation analysis was applied for determining the
   architecture of each ANN model in terms of input variables. Several
   statistical criteria (RMSE, MAE and coefficient of correlation) were
   used to check the model accuracy in comparison with the observed data by
   means of K-fold cross validation method. Additionally, residual analysis
   was applied for the model results. The comparison results revealed that
   using upstream records could significantly increase the accuracy of ANN
   and MLR models in predicting daily stream flows (by around 30\%). The
   comparison of the prediction accuracy of both ANN models (LMFF and RBF)
   and linear regression method indicated that the ANN approaches were more
   accurate than the MLR in predicting streamflow dynamics. The LMFF model
   was able to improve the average of root mean square error (RMSEave) and
   average of mean absolute percentage error (MAPEave) values of the
   multiple linear regression forecasts by about 18\% and 21\%,
   respectively. In spite of the fact that the RBF model acted better for
   predicting the highest range of flow rate (flood events, RMSEave/RBF =
   26.8 m3Is vs. RMSEave /LMFF =40.2 m3/s), in general, the results
   suggested that the LMFF method was somehow superior to the RBF method in
   predicting watershed runoff (RMSE/LMFF = 18.8 m3Is vs. RMSE/RBF = 19.2
   m3/s). Eventually, statistical differences between measured and
   predicted medians were evaluated using Mann-Whitney test, and
   differences in variances were evaluated using the Levene's test. (C)

   in artificial bee colony algorithm for numerical optimization}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary computation (EC) paradigm has undergone extensions in the
   recent years diverging from the natural process of genetic evolution to
   the simulation of natural life processes exhibited by the living
   organisms. Bee colonies exemplify a high level of intrinsic
   interdependence and co-ordination among its members, and algorithms
   inspired from the bee colonies have gained recent prominence in the
   field of swarm based metaheuristics. The artificial bee colony (ABC)
   algorithm was recently developed, by simulating the minimalistic
   foraging model of honeybees in search of food sources, for solving
   real-parameter, non-convex, and non-smooth optimization problems. The
   single parameter perturbation in classical ABC resulted in fairly
   commendable performance for simple problems without epistasis of
   variables ( separable). However, it suffered from narrow search zone and
   slow convergence which eventually led to poor exploitation tendency.
   Even with the increase in dimensionality, a significant deterioration
   was observed in the ability of ABC to locate the optimum in a huge
   search volume. Some of the probable shortcomings in the basic ABC
   approach, as observed, are the single parameter perturbation instead of
   a multiple one, ignoring the fitness to reward ratio while selecting
   food sites, and most importantly the absence of environmental factors in
   the algorithm design. Research has shown that spatial environmental
   factors play a crucial role in insect locomotion and foragers seem to
   learn the direction to be undertaken based on the relative analysis of
   its proximal surroundings. Most importantly, the mapping of the forager
   locomotion from three dimensional search spaces to a multidimensional
   solution space calls forth the implementation of multiple modification
   schemes. Based on the fundamental observation pertaining to the dynamics
   of ABC, this article proposes an improved variant of ABC aimed at
   improving the optimizing ability of the algorithm over an extended set
   of problems. The hybridization of the proposed fitness learning
   mechanism with a weighted selection scheme and proximity based stimuli
   helps to achieve a fine blending of explorative and exploitative
   behaviour by enhancing both local and global searching ability of the
   algorithm. This enhances the ability of the swarm agents to detect
   optimal regions in the unexplored fitness basins. With respect to its
   immediate surroundings, a proximity based component is added to the
   normal positional modification of the onlookers and is enacted through
   an improved probability selection scheme that takes the TIE (total
   reward to distance) ratio metric into account. The
   biologicallymotivated, hybridized variant of ABC achieves a
   statistically superior performance on majority of the tested benchmark
   instances, as compared to some of the most prominent state-of-the-art
   algorithms, as is demonstrated through a detailed experimental
   evaluation and verified statistically. (C) 2013 Elsevier BA/. All rights

Abstract = {{Given an undirected, connected and edge-weighted graph, the dominating
   tree problem (DTP) seeks on this graph a tree with minimum total edge

   literature only two heuristics for this problem are proposed so far in

Abstract = {{The analysis of activities in CSCL (Computer-Supported Collaborative
   Learning) environments can provide us with some interesting conclusions
   about collaborative learning processes themselves. Specifically, such an
   analysis can show the effectiveness of such processes and allow for the
   definition of intervention mechanisms which can motivate and engage the
   students in the learning activities. Until now, this analysis has
   focused on the collaboration process and the resulting product
   separately. We hypothesize that the use of Artificial Intelligence
   techniques can be useful for the production of a rule-based system that
   considers both the process and the product. Of the existing techniques,
   we propose the use of Genetic Classifier Systems (GCS) for their ability
   to evolve and adapt. The use of these rules allows for the
   identification and characterization of learning situations, in addition
   to the generation of feedback that can guide the students and the group
   towards a more effective learning experience. At the same time, the rule
   system can adapt to the new learning activities. The analysis method
   proposed in this article focuses on CSCL environments in which the
   collaboration takes the form of a conversation. We also present a tool
   that implements this approach and the results of its application to some
   learning activities, using an environment for collaborative learning of
   design. (c) Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Comput Appl Eng Educ 21: 704-716,

Abstract = {{The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a recent class of swarm
   intelligence algorithms that is loosely inspired by the foraging
   behavior of honeybee swarms. It was introduced in 2005 using continuous
   optimization problems as an example application. Similar to what has
   happened with other swarm intelligence techniques, after the initial
   proposal, several researchers have studied variants of the original
   algorithm. Unfortunately, often these variants have been tested under
   different experimental conditions and different fine-tuning efforts for
   the algorithm parameters. In this article, we review various variants of
   the original ABC algorithm and experimentally study nine ABC algorithms
   under two settings: either using the original parameter settings as
   proposed by the authors, or using an automatic algorithm configuration
   tool using a same tuning effort for each algorithm. We also study the
   effect of adding local search to the ABC algorithms. Our experimental
   results show that local search can improve considerably the performance
   of several ABC variants and that it reduces strongly the performance
   differences between the studied ABC variants. We also show that the best
   ABC variants are competitive with recent state-of-the-art algorithms on
   the benchmark set we used, which establishes ABC algorithms as serious
   competitors in continuous optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have been the center of
   attention in recent years as they can be utilized to set up a
   bidirectional connection to a power grid for ancillary services

   a real-time solution to a non-convex constrained unit commitment (UC)
   optimization problem considering V2G parking lots as dispersed
   generation units. V2G parking lots can be considered as virtual power
   plants that my decrease dependency to small expensive units in a UC
   problem. In this paper, firstly a probabilistic attendance model of
   PHEVs in a parking lot is investigated, while expected number of PHEVs
   as well as the equivalent generation capacity of the parking lot is
   obtained using a radial basis neural network. Secondly, a particular UC
   problem considering V2G parking lot is solved using GA-ANN as a hybrid
   heuristic method. A real-time estimation of PHEVs number in the V2G
   parking lot and real-time solution to UC-V2G problem associated with

Abstract = {{Short-term hydrothermal scheduling (SHS) is a complicated nonlinear
   optimization problem with a set of constraints, which plays an important
   role in power system operations. In this paper, we propose to use an
   adaptive chaotic artificial bee colony (ACABC) algorithm to solve the
   SHS problem. In the proposed method, chaotic search is applied to help
   the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to escape from a local optimum
   effectively. Furthermore, an adaptive coordinating mechanism of
   modification rate in employed bee phase is introduced to increase the
   ability of the algorithm to avoid premature convergence. Moreover, a new
   constraint handling method is combined with the ABC algorithm in order
   to solve the equality coupling constraints. We used a hydrothermal test
   system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The
   numerical results obtained by ACABC are compared with those obtained by
   the adaptive ABC algorithm (AABC), the chaotic ABC algorithm (CABC) and
   other methods mentioned in literature. The simulation results indicate
   that the proposed method outperforms those established optimization
   algorithms. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The application of certain Artificial Intelligence techniques provides
   an efficient solution to the problem of characterizing the magnetic
   field of a high voltage overhead transmission line, and is an
   alternative to the expensive procedure of direct measurements, which
   requires equipment and time, to the use of complex numerical methods of
   a very specific scope, or of simply obtaining a theoretical value
   calculated using analytical procedures which forego the quality of the
   solution in favor of simplifying the calculations. This paper presents
   an implementation based on a hybrid algorithm in which the best
   solutions provided by a metaheuristics (a genetic algorithm which allows
   working with extensions) define the initial simplex for the application
   of the Nelder-Mead Method, which as a local search method permits a
   calculation-intensive search. In order to validate the quality of the
   results generated by this hybrid implementation, the estimates obtained
   are compared with measured values and with values obtained by means of
   analytical procedures. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral diversity is an essential feature of living systems, enabling
   them to exhibit adaptive behavior in hostile and dynamically changing
   environments. However, traditional engineering approaches strive to
   avoid, or suppress, the behavioral diversity in artificial systems to
   achieve high performance in specific environments for given tasks. The
   goals of this research include understanding how living systems exhibit
   behavioral diversity and using these findings to build lifelike robots
   that exhibit truly adaptive behaviors. To this end, we have focused on
   one of the most primitive forms of intelligence concerning behavioral
   diversity, namely, a plasmodium of true slime mold. The plasmodium is a
   large amoeba-like unicellular organism that does not possess any nervous
   system or specialized organs. However, it exhibits versatile
   spatiotemporal oscillatory patterns and switches spontaneously between
   these. Inspired by the plasmodium, we built a mathematical model that
   exhibits versatile oscillatory patterns and spontaneously transitions
   between these patterns. This model demonstrates that, in contrast to
   coupled nonlinear oscillators with a well-designed complex diffusion
   network, physically interacting mechanosensory oscillators are capable
   of generating versatile oscillatory patterns without changing any
   parameters. Thus, the results are expected to shed new light on the
   design scheme for lifelike robots that exhibit amazingly versatile and
   adaptive behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Player Modelling has been receiving much attention from the game
   community in the recent years. The ability to build accurate models of
   player behavior can be useful in many aspects of a game. One important
   aspect is the tracking of a player's behavior along time, informing
   every time a change is perceived. This way, the game Artificial
   Intelligence can adapt itself to better respond to this new behavior. In
   order to build models of player behavior, researchers frequently resort
   to Machine Learning techniques. Such methods work on previously recorded
   game metrics representing player's interactions with the game
   environment. However, if the player changes styles over time, the
   constructed models get out of date. In order to address this drawback,
   this work proposes the use of and incremental learning technique to
   track a player's behavior during his/her interaction with the game
   environment. Our approach attempts to automatically detect the moments
   in time when the player changes behavior. We apply a change detection
   technique from the area of Data Stream Mining that is based on
   incremental clustering and novelty detection. We also propose three
   modifications to the original technique, in order to formalize change
   detection, improve detection rate and reduce detection delay.
   Simulations were performed considering data produced by the Unreal
   Tournament game, showing the applicability of the method to online
   tracking of a player's behavior and informing whenever behavior changes
   occur. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In clinical treatment processes, inpatient length of stay (LOS) is not
   only a readily available indicator of hospital activity, but also a
   reasonable proxy of resource consumption. Accurate inpatient LOS
   prediction has strong implications for health service delivery. Major
   techniques proposed (statistical approaches or artificial neuronal
   networks) consider a priori knowledge, such as demographics or patient
   physical factors, providing accurate methods to estimate LOS at early
   stages of the patient (admission). However, unexpected scenarios and
   variations are commonplaces of clinical treatment processes that have a
   dramatical impact on the LOS. Therefore, these predictors should deal
   with adaptability, considering the temporal evolution of the patient. In
   this paper, we propose an inpatient LOS prediction approach across
   various stages of clinical treatment processes. This proposal relies on
   a kind of regularity assumption demanding that patient traces of the
   specific treatment process with similar medical behaviors have similar
   LOS. Therefore, this approach follows a Case-based Reasoning methodology
   since it predicts an inpatient LOS of a partial patient trace by
   referring to the past traces of clinical treatment processes that have
   similar medical behaviors with the current one. The proposal is
   evaluated using 284 patient traces from the pulmonary infection CTPs,
   extracted from Zhejiang Huzhou Central Hospital of China. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{In car racing, blocking refers to maneuvers that can prevent, disturb or
   completely block an overtaking action by an incoming car. In this paper,
   we present an advanced overtaking behavior that is able to deal with
   opponents implementing blocking strategies of various difficulty level.
   The behavior we developed has been integrated in an existing fuzzy-based
   architecture for driving simulated cars and tested using The Open Car
   Racing Simulator (TORCS). We compared a driver implementing our
   overtaking strategy against four of the bots available in the TORCS
   distribution and Simplix, a state-of-the-art driver which won several
   competitions. The comparison was carried out against opponents
   implementing three blocking strategies of increasing difficulty and two
   different scenarios: (i) a basic scenario with one opponent on a
   straight stretch to overtake as quickly as possible; (ii) an advanced
   scenario involving a race on a non-trivial track against several
   opponents. The results from the basic scenario show that our strategy
   can always overtake the opponent car; in particular, our strategy is
   slightly more risky than the other ones and may result in a little
   damage, however, all the other controllers show a more careful and safe
   policy that often prevents them to complete an overtaking maneuver. When
   racing against several opponents on complex tracks, our strategy results
   in the best trade-off between the time spent being blocked by an
   opponent ahead and the number of overtaking maneuvers completed. (c)

Abstract = {{Multi-parameter patient monitors (MPMs) have become increasingly
   important in providing quality health care to patients. A high alarm
   accuracy (sensitivity) will need a lower threshold for alarm detection
   which will lead to lower no-alarm accuracy (specificity) and vice-versa.
   MPMs when used in an intensive care unit (ICU) need to have high
   sensitivity. However they need to have high specificity when used in
   in-patient wards for regular health check-ups. Proposed is a novel
   algorithm to trade-off specificity for sensitivity and vice-versa
   depending on the application. The proposed method is referred as
   detection error trade-off, trade-off specificity for better sensitivity
   and vice-versa. The algorithm will help to extend the application of
   MPMs from ICUs to in-patient wards and thus enhance the quality of
   health care. Experiments have been conducted with an MPM using the
   classification and regression tree algorithm. By using the proposed
   algorithm, an improvement of 10.18\% in sensitivity was obtained by
   trading-off 0.40\% in specificity. Furthermore, the overall performance
   of the refined system is 1.15\% better than the baseline system.}},

Abstract = {{In the cooperative relay system, different frames from different relays
   are not aligned in the time domain, and have different carrier frequency
   offsets (CFOs). Estimation of these timing offsets and CFOs is a crucial
   and challenging task. In this study, a new training structure is
   proposed, and a novel time and frequency synchronisation scheme is
   presented for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based
   (OFDM-based) cooperative systems. The coarse time synchronisation is
   accomplished by using the symmetric conjugate of the training symbol and
   the fine time synchronisation is accomplished by segment-moving
   correlation. The fractional frequency offset is estimated by using the
   phase difference of the received signal and the integral frequency
   offset is estimated by utilising the good autocorrelation of the
   training symbol in frequency domain. The analysis and the simulation
   results show that, compared with the traditional scheme, the proposed
   scheme has better timing and frequency offset estimation performance and
   lower complexity for OFDM-based cooperative systems.}},

Abstract = {{Embedding planning systems in real-world domains has led to the
   necessity of Distributed Continual Planning (DCP) systems where planning
   activities are distributed across multiple agents and plan generation
   may occur concurrently with plan execution. Akey challenge in DCP
   systems is how to coordinate activities for a group of planning agents.
   This problem is compounded when these agents are situated in a
   real-world dynamic domain where the agents often encounter differing,
   incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. To
   date, DCP systems have only focused on cases where agents' behavior is
   designed to optimize a global plan. In contrast, this paper presents a
   temporal reasoning mechanism for self-interested planning agents. To do
   so, we model agents' behavior based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI)
   theoretical model of cooperation, while modeling dynamic joint plans
   with group time constraints through creating hierarchical abstraction
   plans integrated with temporal constraints network. The contribution of
   this paper is threefold: (i) the BDI model specifies a behavior for self
   interested agents working in a group, permitting an individual agent to
   schedule its activities in an autonomous fashion, while taking into
   consideration temporal constraints of its group members; (ii) abstract
   plans allow the group to plan a joint action without explicitly
   describing all possible states in advance, making it possible to reduce
   the number of states which need to be considered in a BDI-based
   approach; and (iii) a temporal constraints network enables each agent to
   reason by itself about the best time for scheduling activities, making
   it possible to reduce coordination messages among a group. The mechanism
   ensures temporal consistency of a cooperative plan, enables the
   interleaving of planning and execution at both individual and group
   levels. We report on how the mechanism was implemented within a
   commercial training and simulation application, and present empirical
   evidence of its effectiveness in real-life scenarios and in reducing
   communication to coordinate group members' activities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the migration of adaptive filtering with swarm
   intelligence/evolutionary techniques employed in the field of
   electroencephalogram/event-related potential noise cancellation or
   extraction. A new approach is proposed in the form of controlled search
   space to stabilize the randomness of swarm intelligence techniques
   especially for the EEG signal. Swarm-based algorithms such as Particles
   Swarm Optimization, Artificial Bee Colony, and Cuckoo Optimization
   Algorithm with their variants are implemented to design optimized
   adaptive noise canceler. The proposed controlled search space technique
   is tested on each of the swarm intelligence techniques and is found to
   be more accurate and powerful. Adaptive noise canceler with traditional
   algorithms such as least-mean-square, normalized least-mean-square, and
   recursive least-mean-square algorithms are also implemented to compare
   the results. ERP signals such as simulated visual evoked potential, real
   visual evoked potential, and real sensorimotor evoked potential are
   used, due to their physiological importance in various EEG studies.
   Average computational time and shape measures of evolutionary techniques
   are observed 8.21E-01 sec and 1.73E-01, respectively. Though,
   traditional algorithms take negligible time consumption, but are unable
   to offer good shape preservation of ERP, noticed as average

   2.60E+00, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Strikes of lightning, corrosion of chemical contaminants, ice shedding,
   wind vibration of conductors, lines galloping and damage due to external
   forces may induce some fatal accidents such as broken transmission
   lines. The common means to be used for latent faults inspection in
   transmission lines is manually and periodically examined by workers from
   commercial electrical power company. With the development of both the
   artificial intelligence technologies and the smart grid, the method of
   detecting broken strands in transmission line by inspection robot with
   detectors is a method with good prospect. In this paper, a method with
   eddy current transducer carried by robot for detecting broken strands in
   transmission line is developed and the broken strands in transmission
   line identification approach based on S-transform is proposed. The
   proposed approach utilizes S-transform to extract the module and phase
   information at each frequency point from detection signals. Through
   module phase and comparison, the characteristic frequency points are
   ascertained, and the fault information of the detection signal is
   constructed. The broken strands identification confidence degree is
   defined with Shannon fuzzy entropy (SFE-BSICD). The proposed approach
   combines module information while utilizing phase information, SFE-BSICD
   and the energy, so the reliability is greatly improved. These
   characteristic qualities of broken strands in transmission line are the
   input of support vector machine with multi-classification, and then the
   number of broken strands can be determined. Through field experimental
   verification, it can be concluded that the proposed approach shows high
   accuracy and the SFE-BSICD is defined reasonably. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Incremental learning could be really useful for fault detection and
   anticipation in non-destructive testing and evaluation. The real-time
   monitoring could be proficiently exploited when an early warning system
   is required for the human safety. This is the case of aeronautic
   transportation of persons and goods. Here, an automated neural-based
   system for defect detection in aeronautic composites is proposed. The
   entire system consists of a stand-alone defect classifier based on a
   Bayesian neural network (BNN) combined with advantages of Very Large
   Scale Integration (VLSI )implementation. Exploiting a parallel
   implementation is worthwhile when high computational speed, special
   operating conditions, portability, limited physical size, low-power
   dissipation and reliability are required. This study shows how
   hardware-based neural network can increase processing speed and defect
   identification rate. Secondary random access memory-based field
   programmable gate arrays represent a suitable platform to realise these
   models, since their re-programmability can rapidly change the parameters
   of the network if a new training is needed. With the hardware-based BNN,
   100\% of delamination bottom/top, inclusion bottom/middle/top, porosity
   and 99.6\% of delamination middle were correctly identified. The
   achieved results highlight the efficient design of the hardware network,
   obtained also using a new circuit to compute the activation function of
   neurons.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A famous result by Jeavons, Cohen, and Gyssens shows that every
   Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) where the constraints are
   preserved by a semi-lattice operation can be solved in polynomial time.
   This is one of the basic facts for the so-called universal algebraic
   approach to a systematic theory of tractability and hardness in finite
   domain constraint satisfaction. Not surprisingly, the theorem of Jeavons
   et al. fails for arbitrary infinite domain CSPs. Many CSPs of practical
   interest, though, and in particular those CSPs that are motivated by
   qualitative reasoning calculi from artificial intelligence, can be
   formulated with constraint languages that are rather well-behaved from
   amodel-theoretic point of view. In particular, the automorphism group of
   these constraint languages tends to be large in the sense that the
   number of orbits of n-subsets of the automorphism group is bounded by
   some function in n.
   In this article we present a generalization of the theorem by Jeavons et
   al. to infinite domain CSPs where the number of orbits of n-subsets
   grows subexponentially in n, and prove that preservation under a
   semi-lattice operation for such CSPs implies polynomial-time
   tractability. Unlike the result of Jeavons et al., this includes CSPs
   that cannot be solved by Datalog.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their feasibility and effectiveness, artificial
   intelligence-based intrusion detection systems attract considerable
   interest from researchers. However, when confronted with large-scale
   data sets, many artificial intelligence-based intrusion detection
   systems could suffer from a high computational burden, even though the
   feature selection method can help to reduce the computational
   complexity. To improve the efficiency, we propose a representative
   instance selection method to preprocess the original data set before
   training a classifier, which is independent of the learning algorithm
   that is used for constructing the intrusion detection system. In this
   study, a new metric is introduced to measure the representative power of
   an instance with respect to its class. Based on an implementation of
   representativeness, we select the most representative instance in each
   subset divided by a novel centroid-based partitioning strategy, and
   then, we utilise the result as training data to build various intrusion
   detection models efficiently. Experimental results on a labelled
   flow-based data set introduced in 2009 show that ANN, KNN, SVM and
   Liblinear learning with a largely reduced set of representative
   instances can not only achieve high efficiency in detecting network
   attacks but also provide comparable detection performance in terms of
   the detection rate, precision, F-score and accuracy, as compared with
   four corresponding classifiers built with the original large data set.

Abstract = {{Background: A highly sensitive real-time syndrome surveillance system is
   critical to detect, monitor, and control infectious disease outbreaks,
   such as influenza. Direct comparisons of diagnostic accuracy of various
   surveillance systems are scarce.
   Objective: To statistically compare sensitivity and specificity of
   multiple proprietary and open source syndrome surveillance systems to
   detect influenza-like illness (ILI).
   Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing
   data from 1122 patients seen during November 1-7,2009 in the emergency
   department of a single urban academic medical center. The study compared
   the Geographic Utilization of Artificial Intelligence in Real-time for
   Disease Identification and Alert Notification (GUARDIAN) system to the
   Complaint Coder (CoCo) of the Real-time Outbreak Detection System
   (RODS), the Symptom Coder (SyCo) of RODS, and to a standardized report
   generated via a proprietary electronic medical record (EMR) system.
   Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each classifier's ability to
   identify ILI cases were calculated and compared to a manual review by a
   board-certified emergency physician. Chi-square and McNemar's tests were
   used to evaluate the statistical difference between the various
   surveillance systems.
   Results: The performance of GUARDIAN in detecting ILI in terms of
   sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, as compared to a physician chart
   review, was 95.5\%, 97.6\%, and 97.1\%, respectively. The EMR,generated
   reports were the next best system at identifying disease activity with a
   sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 36.7\%, 99.3\%, and 83.2\%,
   respectively. RODS (CoCo and SyCo) had similar sensitivity (35.3\%) but
   slightly different specificity (CoCo = 98.9\%; SyCo = 99.3\%). The
   GUARDIAN surveillance system with its multiple data sources performed
   significantly better compared to CoCo (chi(2) = 130.6, p < 0.05), SyCo
   (chi(2) = 125.2,p < 0.05), and EMR-based reports (chi(2) = 121.3,p <
   0.05). In addition, similar significant improvements in the accuracy
   (>12\%) and sensitivity (>47\%) were observed for GUARDIAN with only
   chief complaint data as compared to RODS (CoCo and SyCo) and EMR-based
   reports.
   Conclusion: In our study population, the GUARDIAN surveillance system,
   with its ability to utilize multiple data sources from patient
   encounters and real-time automaticity, demonstrated a more robust
   performance when compared to standard EMR-based reports and the RODS
   systems in detecting ILI. More large-scale studies are needed to
   validate the study findings, and to compare the performance of GUARDIAN
   in detecting other infectious diseases. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have been conducted to understand the shear behavior of
   reinforced concrete (RC) beams since it is a complex phenomenon. The
   diagonal cracking strength of a RC beam is critical since it is
   essential for determining the minimum amount of stirrups and the
   contribution of concrete to the shear strength of the beam. Most of the
   existing equations predicting the diagonal cracking strength of RC beams
   are based on experimental data. A powerful computational tool for
   analyzing experimental data is an artificial neural network (ANN). Its
   advantage over conventional methods for empirical modeling is that it
   does not require any functional form and it can be easily updated
   whenever additional data is available. An ANN model was developed for
   predicting the diagonal cracking strength of RC slender beams without
   stirrups. It is shown that the performance of the ANN model over the
   experimental data considered in this study is better than the
   performances of six design code equations and twelve equations proposed
   by various researchers. In addition, a parametric study was conducted to
   study the effects of various parameters on the diagonal cracking
   strength of RC slender beams without stirrups upon verifying the model.}},

Abstract = {{The new techniques of three-dimensional (3D)-optical coherence
   tomography (OCT) imaging is very useful for detecting retinal pathologic
   changes in various diseases and determining retinal thickness
   abnormalities'. Fundus colour images have been used for several years
   for detecting retinal abnormalities too. If the two image modalities
   were combined, the resulted image would be more informative. The first
   step to combine these two modalities is to register colour fundus images
   with an en face representation of OCT. In this study, curvelet transform
   is used to extract vessels for both modalities. Then the extracted
   vessels from two modalities are registered together in two stages. At
   first, images are registered using scaling and translation
   transformations. Then a quadratic transformation model is assumed
   between two pairs of images; because retina is imaged as a second-order
   surface. Twenty-two eyes (17 macular and 5 prepapillary), from random
   patients, were imaged in this study with Topcon 3D OCT1000 instrument. A
   new registration error is defined which averages the distance between
   all the corresponding points in two sets of vessels. Results show that
   registration error after stage one is 6.01 +/- 1.82 pixels and after
   stage two is 1.02 +/- 0.02 pixels.}},

Abstract = {{In our paper (Annals of Operations Research, 193: 71-90, 2012) we
   introduced a special kind of k - 1-width junction tree, called k-th
   order cherry tree in order to approximate a joint probability
   distribution. The approximation is the best if the Kullback-Leibler
   divergence between the true joint probability distribution and the
   approximating one is minimal. Finding the best approximating k - 1-width
   junction tree probability distribution is NP-complete if 2 < k < d - 1,
   where d is the dimension of the joint probability distribution (see
   Karger and Srebro in 12th ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms
   (SODA), 2001, Malvestuto in Kybernetika 48:825-844, 2012). In Broad
   Research in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience (BRAIN), special
   issue on complexity in sciences and artificial intelligence, pp. 40-45,
   2010 we also proved that the best approximating k - 1-width junction
   tree probability distribution can be embedded into a k-th order cherry
   tree probability distribution.
   We introduce here a greedy algorithm resulting very good approximations
   in reasonable computing time. We prove then that if the Markov network
   which encodes the conditional independences of the multivariate
   probability distribution fulfills some requirements then our greedy
   algorithm is able to find the true probability distribution. Our
   algorithm uses just the k-th order marginal probability distributions as
   input.
   We compare the results of the greedy algorithm proposed in this paper
   with the greedy algorithm proposed by Malvestuto (IEEE Trans. Syst. Man
   Cybern. 21:1287-1294, 1991).}},

Abstract = {{Ship handling during berthing is considered as one of the most
   sophisticated tasks that a ship master has to face. The presence of
   current and wind make it even more complicated to execute, especially
   when ship approaches to a pier in low speed. To deal with such
   phenomenon, only experienced human brain decides the necessary action
   taken depending on situation demand. So automation in berthing is still
   far beyond imagination. But, if the human brain can be replicated by any
   suitable artificial intelligence technique to perform the same action
   that human brain does during berthing, then automatic ship berthing is
   possible. In this research artificial neural network is used for that
   purpose. To enhance its learnability, consistent teaching data based on
   the virtual window concept are created to ensure optimal steering with
   the help of nonlinear programming language (NPL) method. Then instead of
   centralized controller, two separate feed forward neural networks are
   trained using Lavenberg-Marquardt algorithm in backpropagation technique
   for command rudder angle and propeller revolution output respectively.
   The trained ANNs are then verified for their workability in no wind
   condition. On the other hand, separate ANNs are trained with
   reconstructed teaching data considering gust wind disturbances. To deal
   with any abrupt condition, ANN followed by PD controller is also
   introduced in case of command rudder angle output whose effectiveness is
   well verified not only for teaching data but also in case of
   non-teaching data and different gust wind distributions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Network virtualization is not only regarded as a promising technology to
   create an ecosystem for cloud computing applications, but also
   considered a promising technology for the future Internet. One of the
   most important issues in network virtualization is the virtual network
   embedding (VNE) problem, which deals with the embedding of virtual
   network (VN) requests in an underlying physical (substrate network)
   infrastructure. When both the node and link constraints are considered,
   the VN embedding problem is NP-hard, even in an offline situation. Some
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been applied to the VNE
   algorithm design and displayed their abilities. This paper aims to
   compare the computational effectiveness and efficiency of different AI
   techniques for handling the cost-aware VNE problem. We first propose two
   kinds of VNE algorithms, based on Ant Colony Optimization and genetic
   algorithm. Then we carry out extensive simulations to compare the
   proposed VNE algorithms with the existing AI-based VNE algorithms in
   terms of the VN Acceptance Ratio, the long-term revenue of the service
   provider, and the VN embedding cost. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate estimation of half-cone geometry (i.e., volume and length)
   created by pressure flushing operation in dam reservoirs is required for
   sediment management in the reservoir storage. In this study, two
   artificial intelligence techniques namely, Artificial Neural Network
   (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) were utilized to
   estimate the volume and length of flushing half-cone based on
   influential variables, i.e., mean flow velocity through bottom outlet
   (u), water depth in reservoir (H-w), mean grain diameter of deposited
   sediments (d(50)), thickness of deposited sediment (H-s) and bottom
   outlet diameter (D). Experimental data in both dimensional and
   non-dimensional forms were used to train and test ANN and ANFIS models.
   The results of the intelligence-based models were also compared with
   those of existing studies. The outcomes indicated that both ANN and
   ANFIS models predict the volume and length of flushing half-cone more
   accurately than existing studies. Also, it was found that the ANN model
   provides a better estimation of the geometry of flushing half-cone
   compared to the ANFIS model. Finally, sensitivity analysis was conducted
   to determine the most and the least influential variables affecting the
   flushing half-cone geometry. It was found that the sediment
   characteristics (H-s,H- and d(50)) and fluids properties (H-w, and u)
   have respectively the most and the least effect on flushing half-cone
   volume and length. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines concepts of independence for full conditional
   probabilities; that is, for set-functions that encode conditional
   probabilities as primary objects, and that allow conditioning on events
   of probability zero. Full conditional probabilities have been used in
   economics, in philosophy, in statistics, in artificial intelligence.
   This paper characterizes the structure of full conditional probabilities
   under various concepts of independence; limitations of existing concepts
   are examined with respect to the theory of Bayesian networks. The
   concept of layer independence (factorization across layers) is
   introduced; this seems to be the first concept of independence for full
   conditional probabilities that satisfies the graphoid properties of

Abstract = {{An implementation of a three-phase distribution static compensator
   (DSTATCOM) using learning vector quantisation (LVQ) control algorithm is
   presented for compensation of loads in a distribution system. The
   DSTATCOM is used for harmonics elimination, load balancing and reactive
   power compensation with self-supporting dc bus in distribution system.
   The LVQ-based control algorithm is used for extraction of fundamental
   weighted values of active and reactive power components of load currents
   which are required for estimation of reference supply currents. It is
   based on a double supervisory system where each weighted vector is
   modified by input weights. The input weights are trained outputs of the
   first stage learning weights. It is needed for accurate estimation of
   compensation currents from the voltage source converter (VSC) used in
   DSTATCOM. A prototype of the VSC-based DSTATCOM is developed using a
   digital signal processor to validate the proposed control approach and
   its performance is studied under a steady state and dynamic conditions.
   The performance of the DSTATCOM is found satisfactory with the proposed
   control algorithm under linear and non-linear loads which are commonly
   used in the distribution system. The dc bus voltage of the VSC of
   DSTATCOM has a negligible effect on varying loads.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{69}},

Abstract = {{Prognostics and health management (PHM) methods aim at detecting the
   degradation, diagnosing the faults and predicting the time at which a
   system or a component will no longer perform its desired function. PHM
   is based on access to a model of a system or a component using one or
   combination of physical or data-driven models. In physical-based models,
   one has to gather a lot of knowledge about the desired system and then
   build an analytical model of the system function of the degradation
   mechanism that is used as a reference during system operation. On the
   other hand, data-driven models are based on the exploitation of symptoms
   or indicators of degradations using statistical or artificial
   intelligence methods on the monitored system once it is operational and
   learn the normal behaviour. Trend extraction is one of the methods used
   to extract important information contained in the sensory signals, which
   can be used for data-driven models. However, extraction of such
   information from the collected data in a practical working environment
   is always a great challenge as sensory signals are usually
   multidimensional and obscured by noise. Also, the extracted trends
   should represent the nominal behaviour of the system as well as the
   health status evolution. This paper presents a method for nonparametric
   trend modelling from multidimensional sensory data so as to use such
   trends in machinery health prognostics. The goal of this work is to
   develop a method that can extract features representing the nominal
   behaviour of the monitored component, and from these features, smooth
   trends are extracted to represent the critical component's health
   evolution over the time. The proposed method starts by multidimensional
   feature extraction from machinery sensory signals. Then, unsupervised
   feature selection on the features' domain is applied without making any
   assumptions concerning the number of the extracted features. The
   selected features can be used to represent the nominal behaviour of the
   system and hence detect any deviation. Then, empirical mode
   decomposition algorithm is applied on the projected features with the
   purpose of following the evolution of data in a compact representation
   over time. Finally, ridge regression is applied to the extracted trend
   for modelling and can be used later for the remaining useful life
   prediction. The method is demonstrated on accelerated degradation data
   set of bearings acquired from PRONOSTIA experimental platform and
   another data set downloaded from NASA repository where it is shown to be
   able to extract signal trends.}},

Abstract = {{Optimizing the cost of evaluating a polynomial is a classic problem in
   comp. titer science. For polynomials in one variable, Homer's method
   provides a scheme for producing a computationally efficient form. For
   multivariate polynomials it is possible to generalize Horner's method,
   but this leaves freedom in the order of the variables. Traditionally,
   greedy schemes like most-occurring variable first are used. This simple
   textbook algorithm has given remarkably efficient results. Finding
   better algorithms has proved difficult. In trying to improve upon the
   greedy scheme we have implemented Monte Carlo tree search, a recent
   search method from the field of artificial intelligence. This results in
   better Homer schemes and reduces the cost of evaluating polynomials,
   sometimes by factors up to two. (C) 2013 Elsevier ay. All rights

Abstract = {{Some of the systems used in natural language generation (NLG), a branch

   original messages, and can even simulate illocutionary force and speaker
   meaning. Background intelligence embedded in their datasets enhances
   these speech capacities. Although there is an open question about who is
   ultimately responsible for their speech, if anybody, we can settle this
   question by using the notion of proxy speech, in which responsibility
   for artificial speech acts is assigned legally or conventionally to an

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Automated compliance checking (ACC) in the construction domain continues
   to be a challenge. Current ACC systems do not provide the level of
   knowledge representation and reasoning that is needed to efficiently
   interpret applicable norms (e.g.,laws, regulations, contractual
   requirements, advisory practices) and check conformance of designs and
   operations to those interpretations. In this paper, the authors explore
   a new approach to ACC and propose to apply theoretical and computational
   developments in the fields of deontology, deontic logic, and natural
   language processing to the problem of compliance checking in
   construction. Deontology is a theory of rights and obligations, and
   deontic logic is a branch of modal logic that deals with obligations,
   prohibitions, and permissions. This paper focuses on presenting a
   deontology for ACC in construction. The deontic model is composed of a
   hierarchy of normative concepts, interconcept relations, and deontic
   axioms (rules represented using deontic logic). The deontology was
   evaluated through formal competency questions, automated consistency
   checking, automated redundancy checking, expert evaluation, and
   application-oriented evaluation. The deontic model was manually applied
   in checking the compliance of storm-water pollution prevention plans
   with applicable norms. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{An artificial intelligence model utilizing feedforward back-propagation
   (FFBP) and nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) artificial neural
   networks (ANNs) is presented to model the nonlinear behavior of
   buckling-restrained braces (BRBs). The NARX ANN is developed using
   normalized time-delayed inputs and outputs to predict normalized brace
   forces during load reversals. The values of brace forces are
   denormalized via an auxiliary FFBP ANN. The training and testing of the
   proposed model (i.e.,the NARX and FFBP ANNs) are performed using
   experimental data from BRB specimens tested at the Pacific Earthquake
   Engineering Research (PEER) Center. Experimental data from one specimen
   is used in the model developing (training) stage. In addition, three
   sets of data are used to test the model's learning and generalizing
   abilities. Brace deformations are used as the network input to estimate
   the resulting brace forces. The network performance with different
   parameters is evaluated to arrive at an optimized architecture that best
   models the phenomenon. The nonlinear hysteretic behavior predicted by
   the ANN model shows excellent agreement with the experimental results
   for the training sample. The generalization and prediction capability of
   the proposed model is further demonstrated by predicting the hysteretic
   behavior of the testing samples with noticeable accuracy. The presented
   model is a powerful tool for virtually testing BRB specimens. Such a
   tool supplements the traditionally available experimental tools for BRB
   performance investigation. The developed modeling technique facilitates
   the BRB design and performance investigation processes by minimizing the
   need for, and extent of, experimental testing. (C) 2013 American Society

Abstract = {{Advances in processing capacity, coupled with the desire to tackle
   problems where a human subjective judgment plays an important role in
   determining the value of a proposed solution, has led to a dramatic rise
   in the number of applications of Interactive Artificial Intelligence. Of
   particular note is the coupling of meta-heuristic search engines with
   user-provided evaluation and rating of solutions, usually in the form of
   Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms (IEAs). These have a well-documented
   history of successes, but arguably the preponderance of IEAs stems from
   this history, rather than as a conscious design choice of meta-heuristic
   based on the characteristics of the problem at hand. This paper sets out
   to examine the basis for that assumption, taking as a case study the
   domain of interactive software design. We consider a range of factors
   that should affect the design choice including ease of use, scalability,
   and of course, performance, i.e. that ability to generate good solutions
   within the limited number of evaluations available in interactive work
   before humans lose focus. We then evaluate three methods, namely greedy
   local search, an evolutionary algorithm and ant colony optimization
   (ACO), with a variety of representations for candidate solutions.
   Results show that after suitable parameter tuning, ACO is highly
   effective within interactive search and out-performs evolutionary
   algorithms with respect to increasing numbers of attributes and methods
   in the software design problem. However, when larger numbers of classes
   are present in the software design, an evolutionary algorithm using a na
   < ve grouping integer-based representation appears more scalable.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative methods for taste evaluation of fruits are of great interest
   to the food industry. This paper deals with the application of
   ANFIS-based image processing to characterize orange taste. For this
   purpose, images of 300 orange samples (Bam, Khooni and Thompson
   varieties) were acquired using a camera and the relevant features were
   extracted. The features were RGB component, HSV component, texture
   features, major and minor diameters, area, circumference, R/G and R/B
   color component ratio and diameter ratio. A sensory test performed by
   ten panelists was used to provide the reference data for image analysis.
   Then, the features were entered as input to ANFIS, and taste class of
   the fruit was the output of ANFIS. Based on the results, the success
   rate for the taste classification of Bam, Khooni and Thompson orange
   varieties were found to be 96.6\%, 93.3\% and 93.3\%, respectively. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method that leverages reasoning capabilities
   in a computer vision system dedicated to human action recognition. The
   proposed methodology is decomposed into two stages. First, a machine
   learning based algorithm - known as bag of words - gives a first
   estimate of action classification from video sequences, by performing an
   image feature analysis. Those results are afterward passed to a
   common-sense reasoning system, which analyses, selects and corrects the
   initial estimation yielded by the machine learning algorithm. This
   second stage resorts to the knowledge implicit in the rationality that
   motivates human behaviour. Experiments are performed in realistic
   conditions, where poor recognition rates by the machine learning
   techniques are significantly improved by the second stage in which
   common-sense knowledge and reasoning capabilities have been leveraged.
   This demonstrates the value of integrating common-sense capabilities
   into a computer vision pipeline. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Modelling of diesel engine performance using advanced machine learning

Abstract = {{Traditional methods on creating diesel engine models include the
   analytical methods like multi-zone models and the intelligent based
   models like artificial neural network (ANN) based models. However, those
   analytical models require excessive assumptions while those ANN models
   have many drawbacks such as the tendency to overfitting and the
   difficulties to determine the optimal network structure. In this paper,
   several emerging advanced machine learning techniques, including least
   squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), relevance vector machine (RVM),
   basic extreme learning machine (ELM) and kernel based ELM, are newly
   applied to the modelling of diesel engine performance. Experiments were
   carried out to collect sample data for model training and verification.
   Limited by the experiment conditions, only 24 sample data sets were
   acquired, resulting in data scarcity. Six-fold cross-validation is
   therefore adopted to address this issue. Some of the sample data are
   also found to suffer from the problem of data exponentiality, where the
   engine performance output grows up exponentially along the engine speed
   and engine torque. This seriously deteriorates the prediction accuracy.
   Thus, logarithmic transformation of dependent variables is utilized to
   pre-process the data. Besides, a hybrid of leave-one-out
   cross-validation and Bayesian inference is, for the first time, proposed
   for the selection of hyperparameters of kernel based ELM. A comparison
   among the advanced machine learning techniques, along with two
   traditional types of ANN models, namely back propagation neural network
   (BPNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), is conducted.
   The model evaluation is made based on the time complexity, space
   complexity, and prediction accuracy. The evaluation results show that
   kernel based ELM with the logarithmic transformation and hybrid
   inference is far better than basic ELM, LS-SVM, RVM, BPNN and RBFNN, in
   terms of prediction accuracy and training time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. In CAD systems,
   several studies have investigated the use of wavelet transform as a
   multiresolution analysis tool for texture analysis and could be
   interpreted as inputs to a classifier. In classification, polynomial
   classifier has been used due to the advantages of providing only one
   model for optimal separation of classes and to consider this as the
   solution of the problem. In this paper, a system is proposed for texture
   analysis and classification of lesions in mammographic images.
   Multiresolution analysis features were extracted from the region of
   interest of a given image. These features were computed based on three
   different wavelet functions, Daubechies 8, Symlet 8 and bi-orthogonal
   3.7. For classification, we used the polynomial classification algorithm
   to define the mammogram images as normal or abnormal. We also made a
   comparison with other artificial intelligence algorithms (Decision Tree,
   SVM, K-NN). A Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve is used to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Our system is evaluated
   using 360 digitized mammograms from DDSM database and the result shows
   that the algorithm has an area under the ROC curve Az of 0.98 +/- 0.03.
   The performance of the polynomial classifier has proved to be better in
   comparison to other classification algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Unsaturated soil shear strength can be determined using effective stress
   relation that depends on the effective stress parameter. Several models
   have been developed in the past few years to estimate this parameter. In
   this research, the Gene Expression Programming (GEP) is used as an
   Artificial Intelligence (Al) method for developing a model to predict
   the effective stress parameter, using efficient parameters. The
   principal advantage of the GEP approach is its ability to generate
   powerful prediction equations without any prior assumption on the
   possible form of the functional relationship. The input terminal set
   consists of net confining pressure, suction, Soil Water Characteristic
   Curve (SWCC) fitting parameter, bubbling pressure, residual and
   saturated volumetric water content. The output terminal set has one
   member, which is the effective stress parameter. An experimental
   database obtained from the literature is employed to develop the model.
   Comparison of the model prediction with the actual data, as well as
   other investigators, indicates a very good performance and ability of
   model. Sensitivity and parametric analyses are conducted to verify the
   results. It is also shown that soil suction is the most influential
   parameter in the effective stress parameter of unsaturated soils. (C)

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks have emerged as a complementary technology to
   conventional, cable-based systems for structural health monitoring.
   However, the wireless transmission of sensor data and the on-board
   execution of engineering analyses directly on the sensor nodes can
   consume a significant amount of the inherently restricted node
   resources. This paper presents an agent migration approach towards
   resource-efficient wireless sensor networks. Autonomous software agents,
   referred to as ``on-board agents{''}, are embedded into the wireless
   sensor nodes employed for structural health monitoring performing simple
   resource-efficient routines to continuously analyze, aggregate, and
   communicate the sensor data to a central server. Once potential
   anomalies are detected in the observed structural system, the on-board
   agents autonomously request for specialized software programs
   ({''}migrating agents{''}) that physically migrate to the sensor nodes
   to analyze the suspected anomaly on demand. In addition to the localized
   data analyses, a central information pool available on the central
   server is accessible by the software agents (and by human users),
   facilitating a distributed-cooperative assessment of the global
   condition of the monitored structure. As a result of this study, a 95\%
   reduction of memory utilization and a 96\% reduction of power
   consumption of the wireless sensor nodes have been achieved as compared
   with traditional approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The study introduces a supervised committee machine with artificial
   intelligence (SCMAI) method to predict fluoride in ground water of Maku,
   Iran. Ground water is the main source of drinking water for the area.
   Management of fluoride anomaly needs better prediction of fluoride
   concentration. However, the complex hydrogeological characteristics
   cause difficulties to accurately predict fluoride concentration in
   basaltic formation, non-basaltic formation, and mixing zone. SCMAI
   predicts fluoride by a nonlinear combination of individual Al models
   through an artificial intelligent system. Factor analysis is used to
   identify effective fluoride-correlated hydrochemical parameters as input
   to Al models. Four Al models, Sugeno fuzzy logic, Mamdani fuzzy logic,
   artificial neural network (ANN), and neuro-fuzzy are employed to predict
   fluoride concentration. The results show that all of these models have
   similar fitting to the fluoride data in the Maku area, and do not
   predict well for samples in the mixing zone. The SCMAI employs an ANN
   model to re-predict the fluoride concentration based on the four Al
   model predictions. The result shows improvement to the CMAI method, a
   committee machine with the linear combination of Al model predictions.
   The results also show significant fitting improvement to individual Al
   models, especially for fluoride prediction in the mixing zone.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Recently, speech scientists have been motivated by the great, success of
   building margin-based classifiers, and have thus proposed novel methods
   to estimate continuous-density hidden Markov model (HMM) for automatic
   speech recognition (ASR) according to the notion that the decision
   boundaries determined by the estimated HMMs attain the maximum
   classification margin as in learning support vector machines. Although a
   good performance has been observed, the margin used in the ASR community
   is often specified as a parameter that has no explicit relationship with
   the HMM parameters. The issues of how the margin is related to the HMM
   parameters and how it directly characterises the generalisation
   capability of HMM-based classifiers have not been addressed so far in
   the community. In this study, the authors attempt to formulate the
   margin used in the soft margin estimation framework as a function of the
   HMM parameters. The key idea is to relate the standard distance-based
   margin with the concept of divergence among competing HMM state Gaussian
   mixture model densities. Experimental results show that the proposed
   model-based margin function is a good indication about the quality of
   HMMs on a given ASR task without the conventional needs of running
   experiments extensively using a separate set of test samples.}},

Abstract = {{Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensor array with some
   cross-sensitivities to target gases is often used in electronic nose
   (E-nose) combined with signal processing techniques for indoor air
   contaminants monitoring. However, MOS sensors have some intrinsic flaw
   of high susceptibility to background interference which would seriously
   destroy the specificity and stability of electronic nose in practical
   application. This paper presents an on-line counteraction of unwanted
   odor interference based on pattern recognition for the first time. Six
   kinds of target gases and four kinds of unwanted odor interferences were
   experimentally studied. First, two artificial intelligence learners
   including a multi-class least square support vector machine (learner-1)
   and a binary classification artificial neural network (learner-2) are
   developed for discrimination of unwanted odor interferences. Second, a
   real-time dynamically updated signal matrix is constructed for
   correction. Finally, an effective signal correction method was employed
   for E-nose data. Experimental results in the real cases studies
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented model in E-nose based on
   MOS gas sensors array. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of a tool condition monitoring (TCM) system is to
   ensure reliable monitoring of the cutting tool edge condition. The
   system should be simple to configure for different cutting conditions
   and the obtained results should be interpreted in an unambiguous way.
   Implementation of monitoring system involves finding solutions to a
   number of sub-tasks such as selection of the type of signal, definition
   of sampling rate, selection of patterns, signal filtering, methods for
   the selection and ranking of features, the process of learning and
   creation of knowledge base, user friendly procedure for operating TCM,
   and methods of reacting on established tool condition. Based on these
   considerations, a modular concept of tool condition monitoring system is
   proposed. The concept has been tested on machining processes with
   variable material hardness and cutting depths.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{320-334}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{When objects undergo large pose change, illumination variation or
   partial occlusion, most existed visual tracking algorithms tend to drift
   away from targets and even fail in tracking them. To address this issue,
   in this study, the authors propose an online algorithm by combining
   multiple instance learning (MIL) and local sparse representation for
   tracking an object in a video system. The key idea in our method is to
   model the appearance of an object by local sparse codes that can be
   formed as training data for the MIL framework. First, local image
   patches of a target object are represented as sparse codes with an
   overcomplete dictionary, where the adaptive representation can be
   helpful in overcoming partial occlusion in object tracking. Then MIL
   learns the sparse codes by a classifier to discriminate the target from
   the background. Finally, results from the trained classifier are input
   into a particle filter framework to sequentially estimate the target
   state over time in visual tracking. In addition, to decrease the visual
   drift because of the accumulative errors when updating the dictionary
   and classifier, a two-step object tracking method combining a static MIL
   classifier with a dynamical MIL classifier is proposed. Experiments on
   some publicly available benchmarks of video sequences show that our
   proposed tracker is more robust and effective than others.}},

Abstract = {{Turing's landmark paper on computing machinery and intelligence is
   multifaceted and has an underemphasized ethical dimension. Turing's
   notion of ``intelligence{''} and ``thinking{''} was far more
   encompassing than the common anthropocentric view may suggest. We
   discuss a number of open and underrated problems that the common
   interpretation of the Turing test as a test of machine intelligence
   entails. We suggest that a more meaningful question than ``Can machines
   think?{''} is whether modern computing machinery can amplify human
   intelligence. We cite examples ranging from traditional silicon-based
   environments to carbon-based, living organisms in order to illustrate
   that this kind of intelligence amplification is indeed happening today.
   We conclude that in its interpretation as a test of machine
   intelligence, the Turing test may indeed be harmful for artificial
   intelligence (AI); in its wider interpretation, however, it remains an
   inspiring source for philosophy and AI alike.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been widely applied for their

   electromagnetic (EM) radiated noise source involving EM compatibility
   issues, however, only Missouri-Rolla University utilized the ANN to
   identify EM radiated noise source types based on their different
   frequencies. In this study, a new method was proposed to identify EM
   radiated noise sources by using their spatial characteristics as unique
   parameters for the ANN, which is available even though radiated noise
   source frequencies overlap. A 3-D receiver array is used to collect the
   spatial characteristics of radiated noise sources. By training with 60
   000 datasets, the network can identify the radiated noise source type
   within a few minutes with an accuracy as high as 99.98\%. The influences
   on identification accuracy from different parameters, such as ambient
   noise, interval between neighboring receivers, distance between receiver
   array and radiated noise sources, moving steps of receiver array,
   training data number are discussed in detail. This method can be used in
   EM interference diagnostics and radio monitoring with high speed and

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this research is to propose and investigate a
   novel ant colony optimization-based classification rule discovery
   algorithm and its variants. The main feature of this algorithm is a new
   heuristic function based on the correlation between attributes of a
   dataset. Several aspects and parameters of the proposed algorithm are
   investigated by experimentation on a number of benchmark datasets. We
   study the performance of our proposed approach and compare it with
   several state-of-the art commonly used classification algorithms.
   Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach builds more
   accurate models than the compared algorithms. The high accuracy
   supplemented by the comprehensibility of the discovered rule sets is the
   main advantage of this method.}},

Abstract = {{The design of reliable DNA sequences is crucial in many engineering
   applications which depend on DNA-based technologies, such as
   nanotechnology or DNA computing. In these cases, two of the most
   important properties that must be controlled to obtain reliable
   sequences are self-assembly and self-complementary hybridization. These
   processes have to be restricted to avoid undesirable reactions, because
   in the specific case of DNA computing, undesirable reactions usually
   lead to incorrect computations. Therefore, it is important to design
   robust sets of sequences which provide efficient and reliable
   computations. The design of reliable DNA sequences involves
   heterogeneous and conflicting design criteria that do not fit
   traditional optimization methods. In this paper, DNA sequence design has
   been formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem and a novel
   multiobjective approach based on swarm intelligence has been proposed to
   solve it. Specifically, a multiobjective version of the Artificial Bee
   Colony metaheuristics (MO-ABC) is developed to tackle the problem.
   MO-ABC takes in consideration six different conflicting design criteria
   to generate reliable DNA sequences that can be used for biomolecular
   computing. Moreover, in order to verify the effectiveness of the novel
   multiobjective proposal, formal comparisons with the well-known
   multiobjective standard NSGA-II (fast non-dominated sorting genetic
   algorithm) were performed. After a detailed study, results indicate that
   our artificial swarm intelligence approach obtains satisfactory reliable
   DNA sequences. Two multiobjective indicators were used in order to
   compare the developed algorithms: hypervolume and set coverage. Finally,
   other relevant works published in the literature were also studied to
   validate our results. To this respect the conclusion that can be drawn
   is that the novel approach proposed in this paper obtains very promising
   DNA sequences that significantly surpass other results previously
   published. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The deployment of wireless sensor networks and mobile ad-hoc networks in
   applications such as emergency services, warfare and health monitoring
   poses the threat of various cyber hazards, intrusions and attacks as a
   consequence of these networks' openness. Among the most significant
   research difficulties in such networks safety is intrusion detection,
   whose target is to distinguish between misuse and abnormal behavior so
   as to ensure secure, reliable network operations and services. Intrusion
   detection is best delivered by multi-agent system technologies and
   advanced computing techniques. To date, diverse soft computing and
   machine learning techniques in terms of computational intelligence have
   been utilized to create Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
   (IDPS), yet the literature does not report any state-of-the-art reviews
   investigating the performance and consequences of such techniques
   solving wireless environment intrusion recognition issues as they gain
   entry into cloud computing. The principal contribution of this paper is
   a review and categorization of existing IDPS schemes in terms of
   traditional artificial computational intelligence with a multi-agent
   support. The significance of the techniques and methodologies and their
   performance and limitations are additionally analyzed in this study, and
   the limitations are addressed as challenges to obtain a set of
   requirements for IDPS in establishing a collaborative-based wireless
   IDPS (Co-WIDPS) architectural design. It amalgamates a fuzzy
   reinforcement learning knowledge management by creating a far superior
   technological platform that is far more accurate in detecting attacks.
   In conclusion, we elaborate on several key future research topics with
   the potential to accelerate the progress and deployment of computational
   intelligence based Co-WIDPSs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Software agents are the basic building blocks in many software systems
   especially those based on artificial intelligence methods, e.g.,
   reinforcement learning based multi-agent systems (MASs). However,
   testing software agents is considered a challenging problem. This is due
   to the special characteristics of agents which include its autonomy,
   distributed nature, intelligence, and heterogeneous communication
   protocols. Following the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm, we
   present a framework that allows MAS developers to write test scenarios
   that test each agent individually. The framework relies on the concepts
   of building mock agents and testing common agent interaction design
   patterns. We analyze the most common agent interaction patterns
   including pair and mediation patterns in order to provide stereotype
   implementation for their corresponding test cases. These implementations
   serve as test building blocks and are provided as a set of
   ready-for-reuse components in our repository. This way, the developer
   can concentrate on testing the business logic itself and spare him/her
   the burden of implementing tests for the underlying agent interaction
   patterns. Our framework is based on standard components such as the JADE
   agent platform, the JUnit framework, and the eclipse plug-in
   architecture. In this paper, we present in details the design and
   function of the framework. We demonstrate how we can use the proposed
   framework to define more stereotypes in the code repository and provide
   a detailed analysis of the code coverage for our designed stereotype
   test code implementations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Arguments need to be judged against other arguments. The decision to
   accept or reject an argument is generally a global decision that
   involves examining the same question for other arguments that oppose or
   can defend the argument in question. This article presents the
   acceptability semantics for abstract argumentation that through a
   recursive definition gives a global assignment of the acceptable and
   non-acceptable subsets of arguments. This semantics stems from the aim
   to formalize directly the generally accepted intuition that: `An
   argument can be accepted if and only if all its challenging arguments
   can be rejected.' The acceptability semantics tightly integrates the
   notion of defending against a challenging argument by counter-attacking
   it with the notion of self-defeating (or self-rejecting) arguments that
   (help to) bring about their own non-acceptability. The proposal is
   motivated by earlier studies of the semantics of Logic Programming (LP)
   in terms of argumentation, where the basic well founded and stable model
   semantics of LP can be uniformly captured using a recursively defined
   argumentation semantics for Negation as Failure and where these standard
   semantics of LP can be further extended through argumentation.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{583-606}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an adaptive decision making approach of three families of
   tactics has been proposed for bilateral negotiation: the time dependent
   tactics, behavior dependent tactics, and time independent tactics. These
   tactics are more adaptive to the environment's changes (reservation
   interval, time deadline, opponent behavior). The suggested time
   dependent tactics take advantage from round based time continuity and
   dynamics aspects (features) integrated in their modelling. For suggested
   behavior dependent tactics, a new formalization based on the percentage
   of change was introduced, which helps agents to be more prudent in the
   environments with incomplete information comparing to previous behavior
   dependent tactics suggested by Faratin et al. (Int. J. Robotics Auton.
   Syst. 24(3-4):159-182, 1998). Concerning the new family of tactics which
   are completely independent from time, the agents compute their offers
   based on their reservation interval. These tactics are useful when there
   is no time deadline and, in addition, when the behavior of opponent
   agents doesn't follow any negotiation equilibrium. Moreover, new
   experimental measures are suggested which are more useful for final
   evaluation. The experiments conducted in this paper, prove the
   applicability of all three families of tactic.}},

Abstract = {{Many promising optimization algorithms for solving numerical
   optimization problems come from population-based metaheuristics. A few
   of them are based on Swarm-Intelligence Algorithms, which are inspired
   by the collective behavior of social organisms. One of the most
   successful of such algorithms is the Differential Ant-Stigmergy
   Algorithm (DASA), which uses stigmergy, a method of communication in
   emergent systems where the individual parts (artificial ants) of the
   system communicate with one another by modifying their local environment
   (pheromone intensity). The main characteristic of the DASA is its
   underlying structure (pheromone graph) that uses discrete steps to move
   through a continuous search space. As a consequence of this the
   search-space movement is in some way limited and the algorithm's
   time/space complexity is increased. In order to overcome the problem an
   improved algorithm called the Continuous Differential Ant-Stigmergy
   Algorithm (CDASA) is proposed and then benchmarked on standard benchmark
   functions. This benchmarking showed that the CDASA performs better than
   the DASA, especially at lower dimensions, that its time/space complexity
   is decreased, and that the algorithm code is simplified. As such, the
   CDASA is more suitable for parallel implementations on General-Purpose
   Graphic Processing Units. Compared to the Swarm-Intelligence Algorithms
   presented in this paper, the CDASA is the best-performing algorithm and
   competitive to the state-of-the-art algorithms belonging to different
   metaheuristic approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, diagnosis of diabetes disease, which is one of the most
   important diseases, is conducted with artificial intelligence
   techniques. We have proposed a novel Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)
   algorithm in which a mutation operator is added to an Artificial Bee
   Colony for improving its performance. When the current best solution
   cannot be updated, a blended crossover operator (BLX-alpha) of genetic
   algorithm is applied, in order to enhance the diversity of ABC, without
   compromising with the solution quality. This modified version of ABC is
   used as a new tool to create and optimize automatically the membership
   functions and rules base directly from data. We take the diabetes
   dataset used in our work from the UCI machine learning repository. The
   performances of the proposed method are evaluated through classification
   rate, sensitivity and specificity values using 10-fold cross-validation

Abstract = {{The Semantic Web has been criticized for not being semantic. This
   article examines the questions of why and how the Web of Data, expressed
   in the Resource Description Framework (RDF), has come to be known as the
   Semantic Web. Contrary to previous papers, we deliberately take a
   descriptive stance and do not start from preconceived ideas about the
   nature of semantics. Instead, we mainly base our analysis on early
   design documents of the (Semantic) Web. The main determining factor is
   shown to be link typing, coupled with the influence of online metadata.
   Both factors already were present in early web standards and drafts. Our
   findings indicate that the Semantic Web is directly linked to older
   artificial intelligence work, despite occasional claims to the contrary.
   Because of link typing, the Semantic Web can be considered an example of
   a semantic network. Originally network representations of the meaning of
   natural language utterances, semantic networks have eventually come to
   refer to any networks with typed (usually directed) links. We discuss
   possible causes for this shift and suggest that it may be due to
   confounding paradigmatic and syntagmatic semantic relations.}},

Title = {{Relational databases as a massive information source for defeasible
   argumentation}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{93-109}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Argumentation provides a sophisticated yet powerful mechanism for the
   formalization of commonsense reasoning in knowledge-based systems, with
   application in many areas of Artificial Intelligence. Nowadays, most
   argumentation systems build their arguments on the basis of a single,
   fixed knowledge base, often under the form of a logic program as in
   Defeasible Logic Programming or in Assumption-Based Argumentation.
   Currently, adding new information to such programs requires a manual
   encoding, which is not feasible for many real-world environments which
   involve large amounts of data, usually conceptualized as relational
   databases.
   This paper presents a novel approach to compute arguments from premises
   obtained from relational databases, identifying several relevant
   aspects. In our setting, different databases can be updated by external,
   independent applications, leading to changes in the spectrum of
   available arguments. We present algorithms for integrating a database
   management system with an argument-based inference engine. Empirical
   results and running-time analysis associated with our approach show that
   it provides a powerful alternative for efficiently achieving massive
   argumentation, taking advantage of modern DBMS technologies. We contend
   that our proposal is significant for developing new architectures for
   knowledge-based applications, such as Decision Support Systems and
   Recommender Systems, using argumentation as the underlying inference
   model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization algorithm is relatively a
   simple and recent population based probabilistic approach for global
   optimization. ABC has been outperformed over some Nature Inspired
   Algorithms (NIAs) when tested over benchmark as well as real world
   optimization problems. The solution search equation of ABC is
   significantly influenced by a random quantity which helps in exploration
   at the cost of exploitation of the search space. In the solution search
   equation of ABC, there is a enough chance to skip the true solution due
   to large step size. In order to balance between diversity and
   convergence capability of the ABC, a new local search phase is
   integrated with the basic ABC to exploit the search space identified by
   the best individual in the swarm. In the proposed phase, ABC works as a
   local search algorithm in which, the step size that is required to
   update the best solution, is controlled by Golden Section Search
   approach. The proposed strategy is named as Memetic ABC (MeABC). In
   MeABC, new solutions are generated around the best solution and it helps
   to enhance the exploitation capability of ABC. MeABC is established as a
   modified ABC algorithm through experiments over 20 test problems of
   different complexities and 4 well known engineering optimization
   problems.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Human-like artificial emotional intelligence is vital for integration of
   future robots into the human society. This work introduces a general
   framework for representation and processing of emotional contents in a
   cognitive architecture, called ``emotional biologically inspired
   cognitive architecture{''} (eBICA). Unlike in previous attempts, in this
   framework emotional elements are added virtually to all cognitive
   representations and processes by modifying the main building blocks of
   the prototype architectures. The key elements are appraisals associated
   as attributes with schemas and mental states, moral schemas that control
   patterns of appraisals and represent social emotions, and semantic
   spaces that give values to appraisals. Proposed principles are tested in
   an experiment involving human subjects and virtual agents, based on a
   simple paradigm in imaginary virtual world. It is shown that with moral
   schemas, but probably not without them, eBICA can account for human
   behavior in the selected paradigm. The model sheds light on clustering
   of social emotions and allows for their elegant mathematical
   description. The new framework will be suitable for implementation of
   believable emotional intelligence in artifacts, necessary for
   emotionally informed behavior, collaboration of virtual partners with
   humans, and self-regulated learning of virtual agents. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We developed an original approach to cognition, based on the previously
   developed theory of neural modeling fields and dynamic logic. This
   approach is based on the detailed analysis and solution of the problems
   of artificial intelligence - combinatorial complexity and logic and
   probability synthesis. In this paper we interpret the theory of neural
   modeling fields and dynamic logic in terms of logic and probability, and
   obtain a Probabilistic Dynamic Logic of Cognition (PDLC). We interpret
   the PDLC at the neural level. As application we considered the task of
   the expert decision-making model approximation for the breast cancer
   diagnosis. First we extracted this model from the expert, using original
   procedure, based on monotone Boolean functions. Then we applied PDLC for
   learning this model from data. Because of this model may be interpreted
   at the neural level, it may be considered as a result of the expert
   brain learning. In the last section we demonstrate, that the model
   extracted from the expert and the model obtained by the expert learning
   are in good correspondence. This demonstrate that PDLC may be considered
   as a model of learning cognitive process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The arrival of new devices and techniques has brought tracking out of
   the investigational stage and into the wider world. Using Wi-Fi signals
   is an attractive and reasonably affordable option to deal with the
   currently unsolved problem of widespread tracking in an indoor
   environment. Here we present a system which aims at overcoming
   weaknesses in existing real time location systems (RTLS) by using the
   human approach of making educated guesses about future location. The
   hypothesis of this proposal is that knowledge of a person's historical
   movement habits allows for future location predictions to be made in the
   short, medium and long term. The primary research question that is
   foremost is whether the tracking capabilities of existing real time
   locating systems can be improved automatically by knowledge of previous
   movement especially in the short term in the case of emergency first
   responders by the application of a combination of artificial
   intelligence approaches. We conclude that HABITS improves on the
   standard Ekahau RTLS in term of accuracy (overcoming black spots),
   latency (giving position fixes when Ekahau cannot), cost (less APs are
   required than are recommended by Ekahau) and prediction (short term
   predictions are available from HABITS). These are features that no other
   indoor tracking system currently provides and could prove crucial in
   future emergency first responder incidents.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, an improved version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)
   algorithm is developed to optimize a multi-modal thermodynamic power
   system with dynamic specific heat. Since original Karaboga's ABC for
   constraint problems does not consider the initial population to be
   feasible, a modified method called ``Mutable Smart Bee Algorithm{''}
   (MSBA) is used which utilizes mutable heuristic agents. These mutable
   agents are also capable to maintain their historical memory for the
   location and quality of food sources. These features have been found as
   strong elements for mining data in constraint areas. In additions, our
   implementations reveal that MSBA is faster than Karaboga's method. To
   elaborate on authenticity of MSBA, several state-of-the-art techniques
   are used as rival methods to optimize well-known benchmark problems.
   Then, two main steps are made to optimize Atkinson engine. Firstly, an
   Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is developed to identify
   the dynamic behavior of specific heat. Then, MSBA is hired to design the
   optimum features of the engine. It is observed that the proposed method
   is capable to successfully handle the real-life engineering problem as
   well as the numerical benchmark problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new methodology to solve the problem of fault
   diagnosis in electrical machines. The fault diagnosis method presented
   in this paper is, first, able to provide information about the location
   of a short-circuit fault in a stator winding. Secondly, the method
   enables the estimation of fault severity by specifying the number of
   short-circuited turns during a fault. A cluster of Focused Time-Lagged
   neural networks are combined with the Particle Swarm Optimization
   algorithm for proposed fault diagnosis method. This method is applied to
   the stator windings of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine. Each
   neural network, in the cluster, is trained to correlate the zero-current
   component to the number of short-circuited turns in the stator windings.
   The zero-current component, different from the zero-sequence current,
   are obtained by summing the instantaneous values of current on all
   phases of the stator winding during the diagnosis procedure. The neural
   networks are trained offline with the Extended Kalman Filter method
   using fault data from both computer simulations and an actual Permanent
   Magnet Synchronous Machine. The use of the Extended Kalman Filter
   method, for training, ensures that the neural network cluster used can
   be re-trained online to make the fault diagnosis system adapt to
   changing operational conditions. Results from both computer simulation
   and actual machine data are presented to show the performance of the
   neural network cluster and the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.

Abstract = {{One of the challenges of intelligent systems for education is to use
   low-level data collected in computer environments in the form of events
   or interactions to infer information with high-level significance using
   artificial intelligence techniques, and present it through
   visualizations in a meaningful and effective way. Among this
   information, emotional data is gaining track in by instructors in their
   educational activities. Many benefits can be obtained if an intelligent
   systems can bring teachers with knowledge about their learner's
   emotions, learning causes, and learning relationships with emotions. In
   this paper, we propose and justify a set of visualizations for an
   intelligent system to provide awareness about the emotions of the
   learners to the instructor based on the learners' interactions in their
   computers. We apply these learner's affective visualizations in a
   programming course at University level with more than 300 students, and
   analyze and interpret the student's emotional results in connection with

Abstract = {{Automatic perception of human affective behaviour from facial
   expressions and recognition of intentions and social goals from dialogue
   contexts would greatly enhance natural human robot interaction. This
   research concentrates on intelligent neural network based facial emotion
   recognition and Latent Semantic Analysis based topic detection for a
   humanoid robot. The work has first of all incorporated Facial Action
   Coding System describing physical cues and anatomical knowledge of
   facial behaviour for the detection of neutral and six basic emotions
   from real-time posed facial expressions. Feedforward neural networks
   (NN) are used to respectively implement both upper and lower facial
   Action Units (AU) analysers to recognise six upper and 11 lower facial
   actions including Inner and Outer Brow Raiser, Lid Tightener, Lip Corner
   Puller, Upper Lip Raiser, Nose Wrinkler, Mouth Stretch etc. An
   artificial neural network based facial emotion recogniser is
   subsequently used to accept the derived 17 Action Units as inputs to
   decode neutral and six basic emotions from facial expressions. Moreover,
   in order to advise the robot to make appropriate responses based on the
   detected affective facial behaviours, Latent Semantic Analysis is used
   to focus on underlying semantic structures of the data and go beyond
   linguistic restrictions to identify topics embedded in the users'
   conversations. The overall development is integrated with a modern
   humanoid robot platform under its Linux C++ SDKs. The work presented
   here shows great potential in developing personalised intelligent
   agents/robots with emotion and social intelligence. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Medical and Pharmaceutical industries have shown high interest in
   the precise engineering of protein hormones and enzymes that perform
   existing functions under a wide range of conditions. Proteins are
   responsible for the execution of different functions in the cell:
   catalysis in chemical reactions, transport and storage, regulation and
   recognition control. Computational Protein Design (CPD) investigates the
   relationship between 3-D structures of proteins and amino acid sequences
   and looks for all sequences that will fold into such 3-D structure. Many
   computational methods and algorithms have been proposed over the last
   years, but the problem still remains a challenge for Mathematicians,
   Computer Scientists, Bioinformaticians and Structural Biologists. In
   this article we present a new method for the protein design problem.
   Clustering techniques and a Dead-End-Elimination algorithm are combined
   with a SAT problem representation of the CPD problem in order to design
   the amino acid sequences. The obtained results illustrate the accuracy
   of the proposed method, suggesting that integrated Artificial
   Intelligence techniques are useful tools to solve such an intricate

Abstract = {{Clustering is an important process in many application domains such as
   machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, image analysis,
   information retrieval, and bioinformatics. The main objective of
   clustering is to search for hidden patterns that may exist in datasets.
   Since the clustering problem is considered to be NP-hard, previous
   research has applied bio-inspired heuristic methods to solve such
   problems. In this paper we propose an effective method for clustering
   using an algorithm inspired by the decision making processes of bee
   swarms. The algorithm is called the Best-so-far Artificial Bee Colony
   with multiple patrilines. In the Best-so-far method, the solution
   direction is biased toward the Best-so-far solution rather than a
   neighboring solution proposed in the original Artificial Bee Colony
   algorithm. We introduce another bee-inspired concept called multiple
   patrilines to further improve the diversity of solutions and allow the
   calculations to be distributed among multiple computing units. We
   empirically assess the performance of our proposed method on several
   standard datasets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The
   results show that the proposed method produces solutions that are as
   good as or better than the current state-of-the-art clustering
   techniques reported in the literature. Furthermore, to demonstrate the
   computing performance and scalability of the algorithm, we assess the
   algorithm on a large disk drive manufacturing dataset. The results
   indicate that our distributed Best-so-far approach is scalable and
   produces good solutions while significantly improving the processing
   time. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Analyzing a large amount of data often consumes extensive computational
   resources and execution time. However, sometime all data features do not
   equally contribute to the end results. Thus, it is plausible to identify
   the major contributing features and use them as representatives of the
   data. Other features with low contribution can be eliminated to reduce
   the time/resource consumption in data analysis. One of the promising
   application domains for such a feature selection process is
   bioinformatics. The need for dimension reduction, which is the process
   to reduce unnecessary features from the original data, arises because
   biological data can be massive, with tens of thousands of features to be
   explored. The objective of this study is to design an effective
   algorithm that can selectively remove irrelevant dimensions from data
   describing complex biological processes while preserving the semantics
   of the original data. This research proposes the adoption of the
   Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) as a novel method for data dimension
   reduction in classification problems. ABC, an efficient heuristic method
   based on swarm intelligence, is used to select the optimal subset of
   dimensions from the original high-dimensional data while retaining a
   subset that satisfies the defined objective. The k-Nearest Neighbor
   (kNN) method is then used for fitness evaluation within the ABC
   framework. In this research, ABC and kNN have been modified and bundled
   together to create an effective dimension reduction method. The proposed
   algorithm is validated in two distinct application domains: Gene
   expression analysis, and autistic behaviors study. The experimental
   results exhibit good solution quality as well as good computational
   performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) has achieved state-of-the-art
   clustering quality by performing spectral clustering over an (1)-norm
   based similarity graph. However, SSC is a transductive method, i.e. it
   cannot handle out-of-sample data that is not used to construct the
   graph. For each new datum, SSC requires solving n optimisation problems
   in O(n) variables, where n is the number of data points. Therefore, it
   is inefficient to apply SSC in fast online clustering and scalable
   grouping. An inductive spectral clustering algorithm called inductive
   SSC (iSSC) is proposed, which makes SSC feasible to cluster
   out-of-sample data. iSSC adopts the assumption that high-dimensional
   data actually lie on the low-dimensional manifold such that
   out-of-sample data could be grouped in the embedding space learned from
   in-sample data. Experimental results show that iSSC is promising in
   clustering out-of-sample data.}},

Abstract = {{A recent trend in intelligent machines and manufacturing has been toward
   reconfigurable manufacturing systems. Such systems move away from a
   fixed factory line executing an unchanging set of operations and toward
   the goal of an adaptable factory structure. The logical next challenge
   in this area is that of online reconfigurability. With this capability,
   machines can reconfigure while running, enable or disable capabilities
   in real time, and respond quickly to changes in the system or the
   environment (including faults). We propose an approach to achieving
   online reconfigurability based on a high level of system modularity
   supported by integrated, model-based planning and control software. Our
   software capitalizes on many advanced techniques from the artificial
   intelligence research community, particularly in model-based
   domain-independent planning and scheduling, heuristic search, and
   temporal resource reasoning. We describe the implementation of this
   design in a prototype highly modular, parallel printing system.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{287-295}},

Abstract = {{Automated karyotyping for chromosome classification is an essential task
   in cytogenetics for diagnosis of genetic disorders and has therefore
   been an important pattern recognition problem. The existing learning
   approaches generally discard the previously acquired knowledge and often
   require retraining, leading to space and time complexities. Incremental
   learning methods have gained popularity in the current learning
   scenarios to deal with these issues. This study proposes a novel
   approach of incremental learning for chromosomes classification for
   automated karyotyping of metaphase chromosomes. It addresses the issue
   of catastrophic forgetting with the generation of new class and performs
   knowledge amassing to classify the chromosomes in Denver groups (A-G).
   The adaptive nature of the proposed method contributes to its sustained
   accuracy even for dynamically changing data. An average classification
   accuracy of 97\% is achieved with experimentation on 1800 chromosomes
   from a publicly available database.}},

Title = {{Diagnosing correctness of semantic workflow models}},
Journal = {{DATA \& KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{167-184}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{To model operational business processes in an accurate way, workflow
   models need to reference both the control flow and dataflow
   perspectives. Checking the correctness of such workflow models and
   giving precise feedback in case of errors is challenging due to the
   interplay between these different perspectives. In this paper, we
   propose a fully automated approach for diagnosing correctness of
   semantic workflow models in which the semantics of activities are
   specified with pre and postconditions. The control flow and dataflow
   perspectives of a semantic workflow are modeled in an integrated way
   using Artificial Intelligence techniques (Integer Programming and
   Constraint Programming). The approach has been implemented in the
   DiagFlow tool, which reads and diagnoses annotated XPDL models, using a
   state-of-the-art constraint solver as back end. Using this novel
   approach, complex semantic workflow models can be verified and diagnosed
   in an efficient way. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study extends conventional fingerprint recognition from a
   supervised to an unsupervised framework. Instead of enrolling
   fingerprints from known persons to identify unknown fingerprints, our
   aim is to partition a collection of unknown fingerprints into clusters,
   so that each cluster consists of fingerprints from the same finger and
   the number of generated clusters equals the number of distinct fingers
   involved in the collection. Such an unsupervised framework is helpful to
   handle the situation where a collection of captured fingerprints are not
   from the enrolled people. The task of fingerprint clustering is
   formulated as a problem of minimizing the clustering errors
   characterized-by the Rand index. We estimate the Rand index by computing
   the similarities between fingerprints and then apply a genetic algorithm
   to minimize the Rand index. Experiments conducted using the FVC2002
   database show that the proposed fingerprint clustering method
   outperforms an intuitive method based on hierarchical agglomerative
   clustering. The experiments also show that the number of clusters
   determined by our system is close to the true number of distinct fingers
   involved in the collection.}},

Abstract = {{We present an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solution scheme
   where a set-covering model is used to find a small set of first-choice
   branching variables. In a preliminary ``sampling{''} phase, our method
   quickly collects a number of relevant low-cost fractional solutions that
   qualify as obstacles for the linear programming (LP) relaxation bound
   improvement. Then a set covering model is solved to detect a small
   subset of variables (a ``backdoor,{''} in the artificial intelligence
   jargon) that ``cover the fractionality{''} of the collected fractional
   solutions. These backdoor variables are put in a priority branching
   list, and a black-box MIP solver is eventually run-in its default
   mode-by taking this list into account, thus avoiding any other
   interference with its highly optimized internal mechanisms.
   Computational results on a large set of instances from the literature
   are presented, showing that some speedup can be achieved even with
   respect to a state-of-the-art solver such as IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.2.}},

Abstract = {{Peter Samson designed and built a real- time signal- processing computer
   for music applications in the 1970s. The Systems Concepts Digital
   Synthesizer ({''} Samson Box{''} for short) was installed at the Center
   for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics ( CCRMA) at Stanford
   University in 1977, where it served for over a decade as the principal
   music generation system. It was an important landmark in the transition
   from general- purpose computers to real- time systems for music and
   audio, and helped set the stage for the sea change in the music industry
   from analog to digital technologies that began in the 1980s and
   continues at a rapid pace today.
   This article focuses on the historical context of the Samson Box, its
   development, its impact on the culture of CCRMA and the Stanford
   Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, its use for music research and
   composition at Stanford, and its role in the transformation of the music
   and audio industries from analog to digital practices. A list of
   compositions realized on the Samson Box is included, which shows that
   from 1978 to its decommissioning in 1992 it was used to create over 100
   finished works, many of which were widely performed and were awarded
   prizes. A companion article provides a detailed architectural review and
   an interview with Pete Samson.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{204-218}},

Abstract = {{Spatial data are crucial in disaster planning. However, because of the
   dynamic, urgent and uncertain nature of disasters, certain data and
   functionalities may be inaccessible to decision makers when they are
   required. Web service composition offers a possible solution whereby
   disaster planners can integrate spatial web services to generate new
   spatial data and functionalities, quickly, from existing ones. This
   paper proposes an automatic solution for composing OWSs (Open Geospatial
   Consortium Web Services) for disaster planning. A semantic annotation
   approach based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and SPARQL
   languages is used to describe OWSs semantically. A conceptual model for
   AI (Artificial Intelligence) planning is also proposed that works based
   on RDF and SPARQL. An AI planning algorithm was implemented based on the
   proposed conceptual model to compose semantic OWSs. The applicability of
   the proposed solution is investigated through a case study in evacuation
   sheltering. The case study demonstrates that the proposed automatic
   composition approach can enhance the efficiency of OWS integration and
   thereby improve the disaster management process. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been widely used over the last
   three decades. During this period, many hardware and software solutions
   have been developed and today a new user entering the field can make a
   fast trial to this artificial intelligence solution with commercial
   software and hardware, instead of developing a solution from scratch
   thus saving a lot of time. This work aims at helping new and experienced
   users even further by sharing the ANNs experience in software and
   hardware collected. This was achieved through a survey questionnaire
   about present and past used solutions of software and hardware, as well
   as future prospects for the development of application areas. To further
   enlighten the reader, a logistic regression (LR) statistical analysis is
   performed on the obtained results to extract additional details about
   the answers obtained from the ANN community. The LR statistical analysis
   verifies whether the researchers with more than 25 years of experience
   in ANNs use self-written code when compared to those with less years of
   experience in the area. The LR statistical analysis also verifies
   whether researchers with less than 25 years of experience in ANNs use
   some platform to develop their hardware when compared to those who have
   more years of experience.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-instance learning was first proposed by Dietterich et al.
   (Artificial Intelligence 89(1-2):31-71, 1997) when they were
   investigating the problem of drug activity prediction. Here, the
   training set is composed of labeled bags, each of which consists of many
   unlabeled instances. And the goal of this learning framework is to learn
   some classifier from the training set for correctly labeling unseen
   bags. After Dietterich et al., many studies about this new learning
   framework have been started and many new algorithms have been proposed,
   for example, DD, EM-DD, Citation-kNN and so on. All of these algorithms
   are working on the full data set. But as in single-instance learning,
   different feature in training set has different effect on the training
   about classifier. In this paper, we will study the problem about feature
   selection in multi-instance learning. We will extend the data
   reliability measure and make it select the key feature in multi-instance

Abstract = {{Measuring the blood urea nitrogen concentration is crucial to evaluate
   dialysis dose (Kt/V) in patients with renal failure. Although frequent
   measurement is needed to avoid inadequate dialysis efficiency,
   artificial intelligence can repeatedly perform the forecasting tasks and
   may be a satisfactory substitute for laboratory tests. Artificial neural
   networks represent a promising alternative to classical statistical and
   mathematical methods to solve multidimensional nonlinear problems. It
   also represents a promising forecasting application in nephrology. In
   this study, multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network with fast
   learning algorithms is used for the accurate prediction of the
   post-dialysis blood urea concentration. The capabilities of eight
   different learning algorithms are studied, and their performances are
   compared. These algorithms are Levenberg-Marquardt, resilient
   backpropagation, scaled conjugate gradient, conjugate gradient with
   Powell-Beale restarts, Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient and
   Fletcher-Reeves conjugate gradient algorithms, BFGS quasi-Newton, and
   one-step secant. The results indicated that BFGS quasi-Newton and
   Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm produced the best results.
   Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm outperformed clearly all the other
   algorithms in the verification phase and was a very robust algorithm in
   terms of mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE),
   Pearson's correlation coefficient () and concordance coefficient (R (C)
   ). The percentage of MAE and RMSE for Levenberg-Marquardt is 0.27 and
   0.32 \%, respectively, compared to 0.38 and 0.41 \% for BFGS
   quasi-Newton and 0.44 and 0.48 \% for resilient backpropagation.
   MLP-based systems can achieve satisfying results for predicting
   post-dialysis blood urea concentration and single-pool dialysis dose
   (sp) Kt/V without the need of a detailed description or formulation of
   the underlying process in contrast to most of the urea kinetic modeling
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{A nonogram puzzle is played on a rectangular grid of pixels with clues
   given in the form of row and column constraints. The aim of solving a
   nonogram puzzle, an NP-complete problem, is to paint all the pixels of
   the grid in black and white while satisfying these constraints. This
   paper proposes an efficient approach to solving nonogram puzzles. We
   propose a fast dynamic programming (DP) method for line solving, whose
   time complexity in the worst case O(kl) is only, where the grid size l x
   l is and k is the average number of integers in one constraint, always
   smaller than. In contrast, the time complexity for the best line-solving
   method in the past is O(kl(2)). We also propose some fully probing (FP)
   methods to solve more pixels before running backtracking. Our FP methods
   can solve more pixels than the method proposed by Batenburg and Kosters
   (before backtracking), while having a time complexity that is smaller
   than theirs by a factor of O(l). Most importantly, these FP methods
   provide useful guidance in choosing the next promising pixel to guess
   during backtracking. The proposed methods are incorporated into a fast
   nonogram solver, named LalaFrogKK. The program outperformed all the
   programs collected in webpbn.com, and also won both nonogram tournaments
   that were held at the 2011 Conference on Technologies and Applications
   of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI 2011, Taiwan). We expect that the
   proposed FP methods can also be applied to solving other puzzles
   efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an intelligence-based approach to predict

   methodology for capturing route choice behavior is still lacking because
   extensive labor and time resources are required to collect passenger
   movement data from different stations. In this paper, a four-month site
   survey was carried out to collect actual route choice behavior
   information in nine transportation stations in Hong Kong during peak
   hours. We developed an intelligent model to capture passengers' route
   choice decision-making that achieved prediction accuracy of 86\%. The
   applicability of this intelligent route choice model is demonstrated by
   optimizing the number of gates in a transportation station to inform the
   spatial design of the station.}},

Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{260-278}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Measuring semantic relatedness is a critical task in many domains such
   as psychology, biology, linguistics, cognitive science and artificial
   intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel system for computing
   semantic relatedness between words. Recent approaches have exploited
   Wikipedia as a huge semantic resource that showed good performances.
   Therefore, we utilized the Wikipedia features (articles, categories,
   Wikipedia category graph and redirection) in a system combining this
   Wikipedia semantic information in its different components. The approach
   is preceded by a pre-processing step to provide for each category
   pertaining to the Wikipedia category graph a semantic description vector
   including the weights of stems extracted from articles assigned to the
   target category. Next, for each candidate word, we collect its
   categories set using an algorithm for categories extraction from the
   Wikipedia category graph. Then, we compute the semantic relatedness
   degree using existing vector similarity metrics (Dice, Overlap and
   Cosine) and a new proposed metric that performed well as cosine formula.
   The basic system is followed by a set of modules in order to exploit
   Wikipedia features to quantify better as possible the semantic
   relatedness between words. We evaluate our measure based on two tasks:
   comparison with human judgments using five datasets and a specific
   application ``solving choice problem{''}. Our result system shows a good
   performance and outperforms sometimes ESA (Explicit Semantic Analysis)
   and TSA (Temporal Semantic Analysis) approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Defeating line-noise CAPTCHAs with multiple quadratic snakes}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& SECURITY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{91-110}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Optical character recognition (OCR) is one of the fundamental problems
   in artificial Intelligence and image processing, but recent progress in
   OCR represents a security challenge for Web sites that throttle requests
   with image based CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing Tests to
   Tell Computers and Humans Apart). A CAPTCHA is challenge-response test
   placed within web forms to determine whether the user is human.
   Unfortunately, algorithms capable of solving image based CAPTCHAs can be
   used to create spam accounts and design malicious denial of service
   (DoS) attacks, causing financial and social damage. The problem of
   defeating digital image CAPTCHAs is thus twofold. On the one hand, it is
   an important problem in artificial intelligence and image processing. On
   the other hand, publicly available CAPTCHAs that are not tested against
   state of the art machine recognition algorithms may make the systems
   vulnerable to attack by software bots.
   This paper considers a very important subclass of text CAPTCHAs, those
   characterized by salt and pepper noise combined with line (curve) noise.
   Thus far, attacks on CAPTCHAs with this type of noise have used
   relatively simple image processing methods with some success, but
   state-of-the-art segmentation methods have not been fully exploited. In
   this paper, we propose and benchmark two strong segmentation methods.
   The first method is a modification of a multiple quadratic snake
   proposed for road extraction from satellite images. The second competing
   method is a boundary tracing routine available in the OpenCV open source
   library.
   A first numerical experiment indicates excellent accuracy for both
   methods. A second experiment on human recognition shows that the
   CAPTCHAs used in the study are already near the threshold of being too
   hard for humans. Finally, a third numerical experiment presents a more
   difficult set of CAPTCHAs with the addition of anti-binarization
   methods. The snake-based method is shown to be more resilient to
   anti-binarization schemes than boundary tracing and state-of-the art
   projection-based attacks on CAPTCHAs.
   Since CAPTCHAs corrupted by small line noise are shown to be difficult
   for humans and relatively easy for our algorithm, CAPTCHA designers
   should introduce more challenging distortions into their CAPTCHAs, lest
   the security of systems based on them be compromised. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The growth of industrial applications of artificial intelligence has
   raised the need for design tools to aid in the conception and
   implementation of such complex systems. The design of automated planning
   systems faces several engineering challenges including the proper
   modeling of the domain knowledge: the creation of a model that
   represents the problem to be solved, the world that surrounds the
   system, and the ways the system can interact with and change the world
   in order to solve the problem. Knowledge modeling in AI planning is a
   hard task that involves acquiring the system requirements and making
   design decisions that can determine the behavior and performance of the
   resulting system. In this paper we investigate how knowledge acquired
   during a post-design phase of modeling can be used to improve the
   prospective model. A post-design framework is introduced which combines
   a knowledge engineering tool and a virtual prototyping environment for
   the analysis and simulation of plans. This framework demonstrates that
   post-design analysis supports the discovery of missing requirements and
   can guide the model refinement cycle. We present three case studies
   using benchmark domains and eight state-of-the-art planners. Our results
   demonstrate that significant improvements in plan quality and an
   increase in planning speed of up to three orders of magnitude can be
   achieved through a careful post-design process. We argue that such a
   process is critical for the deployment of AI planning technology in
   real-world engineering applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the laser welding production, the selection and prediction of welding
   parameters is essentially important to guarantee weld quality.
   Artificial neural networks (ANN), which perform a nonlinear mapping
   between inputs and outputs, are an alternative approach for developing
   welding parameter forecasting model. In this paper, in order to speed up
   the convergence and avoid local minimum of the conditional ANN, genetic
   algorithm simulated annealing (GASA) based on the random global
   optimization is inducted into the network training. By means of GASA
   method, weights and threshold of neural networks can be globally
   optimized with short training time. Meanwhile, the gray correlation
   model (GCM) is used as a pre-processing tool to simplify the original
   networks based on obtaining the main influence elements of network
   inputs. The GCM-GASA-ANN method combines the complementary features of
   three computational intelligence techniques and owns very good
   applicability. Through the simulation and analysis of an orthogonal
   experiment, the proposed method can be proved to have higher accuracy
   and to perform better than the traditional ANN to forecast the laser
   welding parameters.}},

Abstract = {{As the volume and breadth of online information is rapidly increasing,
   ad hoc search systems become less and less efficient to answer
   information needs of modern users. To support the growing complexity of
   search tasks, researchers in the field of information developed and
   explored a range of approaches that extend the traditional ad hoc
   retrieval paradigm. Among these approaches, personalized search systems
   and exploratory search systems attracted many followers. Personalized
   search explored the power of artificial intelligence techniques to
   provide tailored search results according to different user interests,
   contexts, and tasks. In contrast, exploratory search capitalized on the
   power of human intelligence by providing users with more powerful
   interfaces to support the search process. As these approaches are not
   contradictory, we believe that they can re-enforce each other. We argue
   that the effectiveness of personalized search systems may be increased
   by allowing users to interact with the system and learn/investigate the
   problem in order to reach the final goal. We also suggest that an
   interactive visualization approach could offer a good ground to combine
   the strong sides of personalized and exploratory search approaches. This
   paper proposes a specific way to integrate interactive visualization and
   personalized search and introduces an adaptive visualization based
   search system Adaptive VIBE that implements it. We tested the
   effectiveness of Adaptive VIBE and investigated its strengths and
   weaknesses by conducting a full-scale user study. The results show that
   Adaptive VIBE can improve the precision and the productivity of the
   personalized search system while helping users to discover more diverse
   sets of information. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The growing use of Information Technology in the commercial arena leads
   to an urgent need to find alternatives to traditional dispute
   resolution. New tools from fields such as artificial intelligence (AI)
   should be considered in the process of developing novel online dispute
   resolution (ODR) platforms, in order to make the ligation process
   simpler, faster and conform with the new virtual environments. In this
   work, we describe UMCourt, a project built around two sub-fields of AI
   research: Multi-agent Systems and Case-Based Reasoning, aimed at
   fostering the development of tools for ODR. This is then used to
   accomplish several objectives, from suggesting solutions to new disputes
   based on the observation of past similar disputes, to the improvement of
   the negotiation and mediation processes that may follow. The main
   objective of this work is to develop autonomous tools that can increase
   the effectiveness of the dispute resolution processes, namely by
   increasing the amount of meaningful information that is available for
   the parties.}},

Abstract = {{End stage renal disease condition increases the risk of cardiovascular
   disease. The mortality rates among hemodialysis patients are 20\% higher
   than the general population, thus in recent years the preservation of
   the cardiovascular system has become a major point of focus for
   nephrology care in patients. Cardiovascular events jeopardize the life
   of a dialysis patient and must therefore be prevented. The aim of this
   study is to develop forecast models that can predict the cardiovascular
   outcome of incident hemodialysis (HD) patients. Data relating to the
   treatment methods and the physiological condition of patients was
   collected during the first 18 months of renal replacement therapy and
   then used to predict the insurgence of cardiovascular events within a
   6-month time window. Information regarding 4246 incident hemodialysis
   patients was collected. A Lasso logistic regression model and a random
   forest model were developed and used for predictive comparison. Every
   forecast model was tested on 20\% of the data and a 5-fold cross
   validation approach was used to validate the random forest model. Random
   forest showed higher performance with AUC of the ROC curve and
   sensitivity higher than 70\% in both the temporal windows models,
   proving that random forests are able to exploit non-linear patterns
   retrieved in the feature space. Out of bag estimates of variable
   importance and regression coefficients were used to gain insight into
   the models implemented. We found out that malnutrition and an
   inflammatory condition strongly influence cardiovascular outcome in
   incident HD patients. Indeed the most important variables in the model
   were blood test variables such as the total protein content, percentage
   value of albumin, total protein content, creatinine and C reactive
   protein. Age of patients and weight loss in the first six months of
   renal replacement therapy were also highly involved in the prediction. A
   greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in the insurgence of
   cardiovascular events in dialysis patients can ensure physicians to
   intervene in the appropriate manner when a high-risk cardiovascular
   condition is identified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm simulates the foraging behavior of
   honey bees. It shows good performance in many application problems and
   large scale optimization problems. However, variation of a solution in
   the ABC algorithm is only employed on one dimension of the solution.
   This would sometimes hamper the convergence speed of the ABC algorithm,
   especially for large scale optimization. This paper proposes a
   one-position inheritance (OPI) mechanism to overcome this drawback. The
   OPI mechanism aims to promote information exchange amongst employed bees
   of the ABC algorithm. For separable function, OPIABC has a higher
   probability resulting in function value improvement of the worst
   positions than ABC. Through one-position information exchange, the OPI
   mechanism can assist the ABC algorithm to find promising solutions. This
   mechanism has been tested on a set of 25 test functions with D = 30 and
   on CEC 2008 test suite with D = 100 and 1,000. Experimental results show
   that the OPI mechanism can speed up the convergence of the ABC
   algorithm. After the use of OPI, the performance of the ABC algorithm is
   significantly improved for both rotated problems and large scale
   problems. OPI-ABC is also competitive on both test suites comparing with
   other recently proposed swarm intelligence metaheuristics (e.g. SaDE and
   PSO2011). Furthermore, the OPI mechanism can greatly enhance the
   performance of other improved ABC algorithms.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is a well known optimization approach to
   solve nonlinear and complex problems. It is relatively a simple and
   recent population based probabilistic approach for global optimization.
   Similar to other population based algorithms, ABC is also
   computationally expensive due to its slow nature of search process. The
   solution search equation of ABC is significantly influenced by a random
   quantity which helps in exploration at the cost of exploitation of the
   search space. In the solution search equation of ABC due to the large
   step size the chance of skipping the true solution is high. Therefore,
   in this paper, to balance the diversity and convergence capability of
   the ABC, Levy Flight random walk based local search strategy is proposed
   and incorporated with ABC along with opposition based learning strategy.
   The proposed algorithm is named as Opposition Based Levy Flight ABC. The
   experiments over 14 un-biased test problems of different complexities
   and five well known engineering optimization problems show that the
   proposed algorithm outperforms the basic ABC and its recent variants
   namely Gbest guided ABC, Best-So-Far ABC, and Modified ABC in most of
   the experiments.}},

Abstract = {{High-radix switches reduce network cost and improve network performance,
   especially in large switch-based interconnection networks. However,
   there are some problems related to the integration scale to implement
   such switches in a single chip. An interesting alternative for building
   high-radix switches consists of combining several current smaller
   single-chip switches to obtain switches with a greater number of ports.
   A key design issue of this kind of high-radix switches is the internal
   switch configuration, specifically, the correspondence between the ports
   of these high-radix switches and the ports of their smaller internal
   single-chip switches. In this paper we use artificial intelligence and
   data mining techniques in order to obtain the optimal internal
   configuration of all the switches in the network of large supercomputers
   running parallel applications. Simulation results show that using the
   resultant switch configurations, it is possible to achieve similar
   performance as with single-chip switches with the same radix, which
   would be unfeasible with the current integration scale. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Methods of general applicability are searched for in swarm intelligence
   with the aim of gaining new insights about natural swarms and to develop
   design methodologies for artificial swarms. An ideal solution could be a
   `swarm calculus' that allows to calculate key features of swarms such as
   expected swarm performance and robustness based on only a few
   parameters. To work towards this ideal, one needs to find methods and
   models with high degrees of generality. In this paper, we report two
   models that might be examples of exceptional generality. First, an
   abstract model is presented that describes swarm performance depending
   on swarm density based on the dichotomy between cooperation and
   interference. Typical swarm experiments are given as examples to show
   how the model fits to several different results. Second, we give an
   abstract model of collective decision making that is inspired by urn
   models. The effects of positive-feedback probability, that is increasing
   over time in a decision making system, are understood by the help of a
   parameter that controls the feedback based on the swarm's current
   consensus. Several applicable methods, such as the description as Markov
   process, calculation of splitting probabilities, mean first passage
   times, and measurements of positive feedback, are discussed and
   applications to artificial and natural swarms are reported.}},

Abstract = {{The most important feature of the intelligent tutoring systems (ITS),
   one of the most popular study topics of recent years, is that it
   provides an opportunity for individual learning by taking students'
   individual differences into account. In order to be able to realize this
   feature, it is necessary that the system recognizes students well. The
   process of recognizing student is performed as a result of observations
   which ITS applies on students. A number of uncertainties arise during
   these observations. In order to minimize learning uncertainties and
   create a productive and effective ITS, type-2 fuzzy logic, one of the
   artificial intelligence techniques, is used in the system developed in
   this study. In order to show the effectiveness of the developed
   web-based ITS, it is applied to the teaching of a basic Control Course.
   The educational evaluation of the system is presented in the paper. (c)

Abstract = {{The presence of electrical and mechanical faults in the induction motors

   effect of harmonic disturbance on the motor-phase current. The aim of
   this paper is the description of a new approach for fault detection and
   diagnosis of IMs using signal-based method. It is based on signal
   processing and an unsupervised classification technique called the
   artificial ant clustering. The proposed approach is tested on a

   bearing failure at different load levels. The experimental results prove
   the efficiency of our approach compared with supervised classification

Abstract = {{Realizing effective listening behavior in virtual humans has become a
   key area of research, especially as research has sought to realize more
   complex social scenarios involving multiple participants and bystanders.
   A human listener's nonverbal behavior is conditioned by a variety of
   factors, from current speaker's behavior to the listener's role and
   desire to participate in the conversation and unfolding comprehension of
   the speaker. Similarly, we seek to create virtual humans able to provide
   feedback based on their participatory goals and their unfolding
   understanding of, and reaction to, the relevance of what the speaker is
   saying as the speaker speaks. Based on a survey of existing
   psychological literature as well as recent technological advances in
   recognition and partial understanding of natural language, we describe a
   model of how to integrate these factors into a virtual human that
   behaves consistently with these goals. We then discuss how the model is
   implemented into a virtual human architecture and present an evaluation
   of behaviors used in the model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper, for the first time, introduces a random forest regression
   based Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Positioning System
   (GPS) integration methodology to provide continuous, accurate and
   reliable navigation solution. Numerous techniques such as those based on
   Kalman filter (KF) and artificial intelligence approaches exist to fuse
   the INS and GPS data. The basic idea behind these fusion techniques is
   to model the INS error during GPS signal availability. In the case of
   outages, the developed model provides an INS error estimates, thereby
   maintaining the continuity and improving the navigation solution
   accuracy. KF based approaches possess several inadequacies related to
   sensor error model, immunity to noise, and computational load.
   Alternatively, neural network (NN) proposed to overcome KF limitations
   works unsatisfactorily for low-cost INS, as they suffer from poor
   generalization capability due to the presence of high amount of noise.
   In this study, random forest regression has shown to effectively model
   the highly non-linear INS error due to its improved generalization
   capability. To evaluate the proposed method effectiveness in bridging
   the period of GPS outages, four simulated GPS outages are considered
   over a real field test data. The proposed methodology illustrates a
   significant reduction in the positional error by 24-56\%. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Relay Coordination in a big distribution system with multiple meshes and
   bidirectional power feed becomes very Complex for protection engineers.
   Manual and graph theory based approaches were applied successfully in
   small power system. In a big distribution system linear and non-linear
   programming based optimizing techniques are applied for relay
   coordination. Presently, artificial intelligence techniques. are applied
   for optimal co-ordination of directional overcurrent relays. This paper
   discusses the application of Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO)
   algorithm for optimal coordination of DOCR relays in a looped power
   system. Combination of primary and backup relay is chosen by using Far
   vector of LINKNET structure, to avoid mis-coordination of relays.
   Coordination of DOCR is tested for IEEE 3, 4 and 6 bus systems using the
   TLBO. Also, the objective function is modified to optimize the operating
   time between backup and primary relays. The results are compared with
   the optimized values of Time dial setting and Plug setting values
   obtained from modified differential evolution algorithm. The proposed
   algorithm TLBO gives optimal coordination margin between 0.3 and 0.8 s
   and no miscoordination between primary and backup pairs. Results are
   also verified using Digsilient power factory simulation software. (C)

Abstract = {{The performance of a stator current-based model reference adaptive
   systems (MRAS) speed estimator for sensorless induction motor drives is
   investigated in this study. The measured stator currents are used as a
   reference model for the MRAS observer to avoid the use of a pure
   integrator. A two-layer, online-trained neural network stator current
   observer is used as the adaptive model for the MRAS estimator which
   requires the rotor flux information. This can be obtained from the
   voltage or current models, but instability and dc drift can downgrade
   the overall observer performance. To overcome these problems of rotor
   flux estimation, an off-line trained multilayer feed-forward neural
   network is proposed here as a rotor flux observer. Hence, two networks
   are employed: the first is online trained for stator current estimation
   and the second is off-line trained for rotor flux estimation. Sensorless
   operation for the proposed MRAS scheme using current model and neural
   network rotor flux observers are investigated based on a set of
   experimental tests in the low-speed region. Using a neural network rotor
   flux observer to replace the current model is shown to solve the
   stability problem in the low-speed regenerating mode of operation.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to show the possibility of combining fault
   detection analysis, detection, modeling, and control of the doubly-fed
   induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine using intelligent control and

   which enables a complete model for fault detection that includes the
   power electronic stage itself. A neural network system based on Hebbian
   networks is applied for fault classification with good detection results
   in simulation. For controlling the wind turbine a number different
   artificial intelligence techniques are presented including fuzzy logic
   and an adaptive fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) which combines the
   characteristics of fuzzy logic and neural networks. A Grey predictor is
   also integrated in the control scheme for predicting the wind profile.
   The combined fault detection and control scheme are validated using
   simulation results. The software development and control platform is
   LabVIEW which is one of the most powerful tools for simulating and

Abstract = {{We propose a new approach to automatically semantize complex objects in
   a 3D scene. For this, we define an expressive formalism combining the
   power of both attribute grammars and constraint. It offers a practical
   conceptual interface, which is crucial to write large maintainable
   specifications. As recursion is inadequate to express large collections
   of items, we introduce maximal operators, that are essential to reduce
   the parsing search space. Given a grammar in this formalism and a 3D
   scene, we show how to automatically compute a shared parse forest of all
   interpretations in practice, only a few, thanks to relevant constraints.
   We evaluate this technique for building model semantization using CAD
   model examples as well as photogrammetric and simulated LiDAR data.}},

   suitable selection of heuristics is quite hard as their behaviour is
   complicated to predict. Autonomous search has been recently proposed to
   handle this concern. The idea is to dynamically replace strategies that
   exhibit poor performances by more promising ones during the solving
   process. This replacement is carried out by a choice function, which
   evaluates a given strategy in a given amount of time via quality
   indicators. An important phase of this process is performed by an
   optimizer, which aims at finely tuning the choice function in order to
   guarantee a precise evaluation of strategies. In this paper we evaluate
   the performance of two powerful choice functions: the first one
   supported by a genetic algorithm and the second one by a particle swarm
   optimizer. We present interesting results and we demonstrate the
   feasibility of using those optimization techniques for Autonomous Search
   in a Constraint Programming context.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the health impacts caused by exposures to air pollutants in urban
   areas, monitoring and forecasting of air quality parameters have become
   popular as an important topic in atmospheric and environmental research
   today. The knowledge on the dynamics and complexity of air pollutants
   behaviour has made artificial intelligence and statistical learning
   models as a useful tool for a more accurate pollutant concentration
   prediction. The aim of this study is to build a regression model of
   daily air quality prediction by using support vector machine (SVM)
   technique in Gijon urban area (Northern Spain) at local scale. To
   accomplish the objective, the observed data of nitrogen oxides, carbon
   monoxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone and dust for years 2006 to 2008 are
   used to create a highly nonlinear model of the air quality in the city
   based on SVM techniques. One objective of this model was to make a
   preliminary estimate of the dependence between primary and secondary
   pollutants in Gijon urban area at local scale. A second aim was to
   determine the factors with the greatest bearing on air quality in order
   to propose health and lifestyle improvements. This support vector
   regression model captures the main insight of statistical learning
   theory to obtain a good prediction of the dependence among the main
   pollutants in Gijon urban area since it shows a good agreement between
   the observed and predicted values of pollutants using statistical
   estimators as correlation coefficients, mean errors and root mean
   squared errors. Finally, conclusions of this study are exposed.}},

Title = {{Belief functions on distributive lattices}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{201}},
Pages = {{1-31}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions is an important approach
   to deal with uncertainty in AI. In the theory, belief functions are
   defined on Boolean algebras of events. In many applications of belief
   functions in real world problems, however, the objects that we
   manipulate is no more a Boolean algebra but a distributive lattice. In
   this paper, we employ Birkhoff's representation theorem for finite
   distributive lattices to extend the Dempster-Shafer theory to the
   setting of distributive lattices, which has a mathematical theory as
   attractive as in that of Boolean algebras. Moreover, we use this more
   general theory to provide a framework for reasoning about belief
   functions in a deductive approach on non-classical formalisms which
   assume a setting of distributive lattices. As an illustration of this
   approach, we investigate the theory of belief functions for a simple
   epistemic logic the first-degree-entailment fragment of relevance logic
   R by providing an axiomatization for reasoning about belief functions
   for this logic and by showing that the complexity of the satisfiability
   problem of a belief formula with respect to the class of the
   corresponding Dempster-Shafer structures is NP-complete. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the presence and potential discrimination of

   focusing on its southern front. Seismological maps indicate the presence
   of several seismic swarms forming within the region of the Hellenic arc,

   two or more. The identification of the number of possibly individual
   seismic clusters in a seismological area is a very challenging task by
   itself, which becomes even more complicated when investigating their
   outer boundaries especially in the case of multiple interacting
   clusters. Complementary to that, the paper also investigates the
   possible temporal correlation of mid-intervals of consecutive large
   earthquakes and patterns in seismic activity during their preparation
   process in the vicinity of the southern Hellenic arc which is shown to

Abstract = {{Research on design and analysis of complex systems has led to many
   functional representations with several meanings of function. This work
   on conceptual design uses a family of representations called
   structure-behavior-function (SBF) models. The SBF family ranges from
   behavior-function models of abstract design patterns to
   drawing-shape-SBF models that couple SBF models with visuospatial
   knowledge of technological systems. Development of SBF modeling is an
   instance of cognitively oriented artificial intelligence research that
   seeks to understand human cognition and build intelligent agents for
   addressing complex tasks such as design. This paper first traces the
   development of SBF modeling as our perspective on design evolved from
   that of problem solving to that of memory and learning. Next, the
   development of SBF modeling as a case study is used to abstract some of
   the core principles of an artificial intelligence methodology for
   functional modeling. Finally, some implications of the artificial
   intelligence methodology for different meanings of function are
   examined.}},

Abstract = {{This research applies artificial intelligence (AI) of unsupervised
   learning self-organizing map neural network (SOM-NN) to establish a
   model to select the superior funds. This research period is from year
   2000 to 2010 and picks 100 domestic equity mutual funds as study object.
   This research used 30 days prior to the beginning of each month's prior
   30 days, 60 days, 90 days on fund's net asset value and the Taiwan
   Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) return as the fund's relative performance
   evaluation indicators classified by month. Finally, based on the
   superior rate or the average return rate, this research select the
   superior funds and simulate investment transactions according to this
   model.
   The empirical results show that using the mutual fund's net asset value
   and the TAIEX's relative return as SOM-NN input variables not only finds
   out the superior fund but also has a good predictive ability. Applying
   this model to simulate investment transactions will be better than the
   random trading model and market. The experiments also found that the
   investment simulation of a three-month interval has the highest
   profitability. The model operation suggests that it is more suitable for
   short-term and medium-term investment. This research can assist

Abstract = {{Keratin protein is ubiquitous in most vertebrates and invertebrates, and
   has several important cellular and extracellular functions that are
   related to survival and protection. Keratin function has played a
   significant role in the natural selection of an organism. Hence, it acts
   as a marker of evolution. Much information about an organism and its
   evolution can therefore be obtained by investigating this important
   protein. In the present study, Keratin sequences were extracted from
   public data repositories and various important sequential, structural
   and physicochemical properties were computed and used for preparing the
   dataset The dataset containing two classes, namely mammals (Class-1) and
   non-mammals (Class-0), was prepared, and rigorous classification
   analysis was performed. To reduce the complexity of the dataset
   containing 56 parameters and to achieve improved accuracy, feature
   selection was done using the t-statistic. The 20 best features
   (parameters) were selected for further classification analysis using
   computational algorithms which included SVM, KNN, Neural Network,
   Logistic regression, Meta-modeling, Tree Induction, Rule Induction,
   Discriminant analysis and Bayesian Modeling. Statistical methods were
   used to evaluate the output. Logistic regression was found to be the
   most effective algorithm for classification, with greater than 96\%
   accuracy using a 10-fold cross validation analysis. KNN, SVM and Rule
   Induction algorithms also were found to be efficacious for
   classification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Efficacious integration of such CAx technologies as CAD, CAM and CAPP
   still remains a problem in engineering practice which constantly
   attracts research attention. Design by feature model is assumed as a
   main factor in the integration effort in various engineering and
   manufacturing domains. It refers principally to feature clustering and
   consequently operation sequencing in elaborated process plan designs.
   The focus of this paper is on CAPP for parts manufacture in systems of
   definite processing capabilities, involving multi-axis machining
   centres. A methodical approach is proposed to optimally solve for
   process planning problems, which consists in the identification of
   process alternatives and sequencing adequate working steps. The approach
   involves the use of the branch and bound concept from the field of
   artificial intelligence. A conceptual scheme for generation of
   alternative process plans in the form of a network is developed. It is
   based on part design data modelling in terms of machining features. A
   relevant algorithm is proposed for creating such a network and searching
   for the optimal process plan solution from the viewpoint of its
   operational performance, under formulated process constraints. The
   feasibility of the approach and the algorithm are illustrated by a
   numerical case with regard to a real application and diverse machine
   tools with relevant tooling. Generated process alternatives for complex
   machining with given systems, are studied using models programmed in the
   environment of Matlab(A (R)) software.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid hydrologic estimation model is presented with the aim of
   performing accurate river flow forecasts without the need of using prior
   knowledge from the experts in the field. The problem of predicting
   stream flows is a non-trivial task because the various physical
   mechanisms governing the river flow dynamics act on a wide range of
   temporal and spatial scales and almost all the mechanisms involved in
   the river flow process present some degree of nonlinearity. The proposed
   system incorporates both statistical and artificial intelligence
   techniques used at different stages of the reasoning cycle in order to
   calculate the mean daily water volume forecast of the Salvajina
   reservoir inflow located at the Department of Cauca, Colombia. The
   accuracy of the proposed model is compared against other well-known
   artificial intelligence techniques and several statistical tools
   previously applied in time series forecasting. The results obtained from
   the experiments carried out using real data from years 1950 to 2006
   demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid system. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

Abstract = {{Classification is one of the most important research topics in data
   mining. In this paper, a manifold distance-based particle swarm
   optimization (MDPSO) for classification is proposed. Firstly, a new
   selection strategy is designed to maintain information of some good
   solutions as well as enhance the diversity of swarm. Furthermore, a
   manifold distance is utilized to measure the similarity of two samples,
   which measures the geodesic distance along the manifold and can better
   reflect the global consistency of the given problems. MDPSO is applied
   to solve 10 benchmark classification problems selected from UCI
   (University of California Irvine) datasets and 10 artificial data sets.
   The experimental results show that MDPSO outperforms the typical C4.5,
   nearest neighbour, and Michigan particle swarm optimization on most of
   the testing problems used in this paper. In addition, MDPSO is applied
   to a real-world application problem, namely handwritten digit
   recognition, with a good performance obtained.}},

Abstract = {{An algorithm is presented for autonomous motion development with
   unbounded waveform resolution. Rather than a single optimization in a
   very large space, memory is built to support incremental improvements;
   therefore, complexity is balanced by experience. Analogously, human
   development manages complexity by limiting it during initial learning
   stages. Motions are represented by cubic spline interpolation;
   therefore, the development technique applies broadly to function
   optimization. Adding a node to the splines allows all previous memory
   samples to transfer to the higher dimension space exactly. The
   memory-based model, which is a locally weighted regression (LWR),
   predicts the expected outcome for a motion and provides gradient
   information for optimizing the motion. Results are compared against
   boot-strapping a direct optimization (DO) on a mathematical problem.
   Additionally, the method has been implemented to learn voltage profiles
   with the lowest peak current for starting a motor. This method shows
   practical accuracy and scalability.}},

   classroom to maximize the performance of all its members, 3)
   automatically obtain the teacher's feedback about the class operation

Abstract = {{Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in the field of

   development of decision support systems. This paper designs an
   agent-based regional agricultural economy decision support system

   architecture of the system, including interface agents, management
   agents, functional agents, model agents, information agents and

   evaluation, forecast, optimization and decision of regional agricultural
   economy are the central task of RAEDSS, this paper gives a detailed
   discussion on the decision processes and internal mechanisms in the
   system. Meanwhile, agent-based modeling is introduced to simulate and
   evaluate policy impact on rural development in different scenarios as an
   important part in RAEDSS. The simulation result shows that this
   agent-based agricultural development model is able to perform
   regeneration and is able to produce likely-to-occur projections of

Abstract = {{The probabilistic reliability evaluation of composite power systems is a
   complicated, computation intensive, and combinatorial task. As such
   evaluation may suffer from issues regarding high dimensionality that
   lead to an increased need for computational resources, MCS is often used
   to evaluate the reliability of power systems. In order to alleviate this
   burden, an analytical method known as state space decomposition has
   previously been used to prune the state space that is sampled using MCS.
   This paper extends the state-of-the-art by proposing a novel algorithm
   known as intelligent state space pruning (ISSP). This algorithm
   leverages the intelligence of highly modified population based
   metaheuristic (PBM) algorithms including genetic algorithms (GA),
   particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), and
   artificial immune systems (AIS) to quickly, efficiently, and
   intelligently prune the state space that is used during MCS. The
   presented PBMs are modified using domain-specific knowledge to improve
   their performance and fine tune their intelligence. This new algorithm
   leads to reductions of up to 90\% in total computation time and
   iterations required for convergence when compared to non-sequential MCS.

Abstract = {{Medical image analysis remains a challenging application area for
   artificial intelligence. When applying machine learning, obtaining
   ground-truth labels for supervised learning is more difficult than in
   many more common applications of machine learning. This is especially so
   for datasets with abnormalities, as tissue types and the shapes of the
   organs in these datasets differ widely. However, organ detection in such
   an abnormal dataset may have many promising potential real-world
   applications, such as automatic diagnosis, automated radiotherapy
   planning, and medical image retrieval, where new multimodal medical
   images provide more information about the imaged tissues for diagnosis.
   Here, we test the application of deep learning methods to organ
   identification in magnetic resonance medical images, with visual and
   temporal hierarchical features learned to categorize object classes from
   an unlabeled multimodal DCE-MRI dataset so that only a weakly supervised
   training is required for a classifier. A probabilistic patch-based
   method was employed for multiple organ detection, with the features
   learned from the deep learning model. This shows the potential of the
   deep learning model for application to medical images, despite the
   difficulty of obtaining libraries of correctly labeled training datasets
   and despite the intrinsic abnormalities present in patient datasets.}},

Title = {{Real-time crowd density mapping using a novel sensory fusion model of
   infrared and visual systems}},
Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{313-325}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Crowd dynamic management research has seen significant attention in
   recent years in research and industry in an attempt to improve safety
   level and management of large scale events and in large public places
   such as stadiums, theatres, railway stations, subways and other places
   where high flow of people at high densities is expected. Failure to
   detect the crowd behaviour at the tight time could lead to unnecessary
   injuries and fatalities. Over the past decades there have been many
   incidents of crowd which caused major injuries and fatalities and lead
   to physical damages. Examples of crowd disasters occurred in past
   decades include the tragedy of Hillsborough football stadium at
   Sheffield where at least 93 football supporters have been killed and 400
   injured in 1989 in Britain's worst-ever sporting disaster (BBC, 1989).
   Recently in Cambodia a pedestrians stampede during the Water Festival
   celebration resulted in 345 deaths and 400 injuries (BBC, 2010) and in
   2011 at least 16 people were killed and 50 others were injured in a
   stampede in the northern Indian town of Haridwar (BBC, 2011). Such
   disasters could be avoided or losses reduced by using different
   technologies. Crowd simulation models have been found effective in the
   prediction of potential crowd hazards in critical situations and thus
   help in reducing fatalities. However, there is a need to combine the
   advancement in simulation with real time crowd characterisation such as
   the estimation of real time density in order to provide accurate
   prognosis in crowd behaviour and enhance crowd management and safety,
   particularly in mega event such as the Hajj. This paper addresses the
   use of novel sensory technology in order to estimate people's dynamic
   density during one of the Hajj activities. The ultimate goal is that
   real time accurate estimation of density in different areas within the
   crowd could help to improve the decision making process and provide more
   accurate prediction of the crowd dynamics. This paper investigates the
   use of infrared and visual cameras supported by auxiliary sensors and
   artificial intelligence to evaluate the accuracy in estimating crowd
   density in an open space during Muslims Pilgrimage to Makkah (Mecca).

Title = {{An argumentation-oriented multi-agent system for automating the freight

Abstract = {{This paper advocates the use of multi-agent systems in the freight
   forwarding industry. We propose an intelligent mobile agent system to
   cope with a dynamic freight forwarding environment where up-to-date
   information is crucial but time-consuming to obtain. A key component of
   our system is an agent argumentation mechanism that allows decision
   support agents to discuss, argue, and come to a compromise in order to
   derive well-explained freight planning solutions. A number of artificial
   intelligence mechanisms are implemented, namely: (1) a
   mobile-agent-based automated information gathering mechanism, where
   designated mobile agents access various websites automatically to gather
   information (e.g., weather conditions on a candidate route) critical for
   cargo consolidation and route planning, (2) a fuzzy logics engine for
   risk evaluation, and (3) a simulated annealing engine for optimizing
   cargo consolidation. A system prototype is developed and the feasibility
   of our approach is demonstrated in a case study. A series of experiments
   are also conducted to evaluate the system's performance. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Biodiversity conservation is a global priority where the study of every
   type of living form is a fundamental task. Inside the huge number of the
   planet species, spiders play an important role in almost every habitat:
   This paper presents a comprehensive study on the reliability of the most
   used features extractors to face the problem of spider specie
   recognition by using their cobwebs, both in identification and
   verification modes. We have applied a preprocessing to the cobwebs
   images in order to obtain only the valid information and compute the
   optimal size to reach the highest performance. We have used the
   principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis
   (ICA), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Wavelet Transform (DWT) and
   discriminative common vectors as features extractors, and proposed the
   fusion of several of them to improve the system's performance. Finally,
   we have used the Least Square Vector Support Machine with radial basis
   function as a classifier. We have implemented K-Fold and Hold-Out
   cross-validation techniques in order to obtain reliable results. PCA
   provided the best performance, reaching a 99.65\% +/- 0.21 of success
   rate in identification mode and 99.98\% +/- 0.04 of the area under de
   Reveicer Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve in verification mode. The
   best combination of features extractors was PCA, DCT, DWT and ICA, which
   achieved a 99.96\% +/- 0.16 of success rate in identification mode and
   perfect verification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{A teachable agent (TA) is an instructional technology that capitalizes
   on the organizing metaphor of teaching another, in this case, a computer
   agent. As one instance, students teach their agents by creating concept
   maps that connect nodes with relational links. TAs use simple artificial
   intelligence to draw conclusions based on what they have been taught and
   to trace the path of their reasoning visually. TAs literally make
   thinking visible, with the goal of helping children learn to reason. TAs
   also provide interactive feedback and engender in students a sense of
   responsibility toward improving their agents' knowledge. We describe, in
   detail, a TA designed to teach hierarchical reasoning in science, and
   then present a 2-year research study using this TA with 153 fourth-grade
   children learning about organisms, taxonomies, and ecosystems. We show
   that the TA improved learning from the standard curriculum as measured
   by the curriculum's accompanying tests. The TA also helped children
   learn hierarchical reasoning, as measured by researcher-designed tests.
   The research indicates that, contrary to some theoretical positions, it
   is possible to help younger children learn scientific modes of
   reasoning, specifically by means of TA software.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a study on the signals of a microdrilling process in
   order to extract features that can be correlated with the cutting tool
   condition, providing the foundations for further developments of
   indirect cutting tool monitoring systems. In a microdrilling process of
   a tungsten-cooper alloy, with TiAlN-coated tools, signals of forces and
   vibrations were measured online. Three different tools with diameters of
   0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mm, respectively, were used and five consecutive holes
   were elaborated with each tool. In each hole were measured not only the
   above-mentioned signals but also the temperature and dimensional
   variations of the cutting tool. Measured signals were processed by using
   time-domain statistics, Fourier fast transform and Hilbert-Huang
   transform for extracting features. Correlation analyses between the
   obtained features and the number of elaborated holes were then carried
   out, in order to identify which of these features can be used for
   estimating the tool condition. Time-domain statistics features did not
   show remarkable correlation with the tool usage level. On the contrary,
   fast Fourier transform and Hilbert-Huang transform yielded very
   interesting outcomes, because some of the analyzed features showed a
   clear elationship with the number of elaborated holes. Future research
   will be focus on the integration of the different signal processing and
   decision-making strategies by using artificial intelligence techniques
   such as neural networks or neuro-fuzzy systems.}},

Abstract = {{During the last years, interest on hybrid metaheuristics has risen
   considerably in the field of optimization and machine learning. The best
   results found for many optimization problems in science and industry are
   obtained by hybrid optimization algorithms. Combinations of optimization
   tools such as metaheuristics, mathematical programming, constraint
   programming and machine learning, have provided very efficient
   optimization algorithms. Four different types of combinations are
   considered in this paper: (i) Combining metaheuristics with
   complementary metaheuristics. (ii) Combining metaheuristics with exact
   methods from mathematical programming approaches which are mostly used
   in the operations research community. (iii) Combining metaheuristics
   with constraint programming approaches developed in the artificial
   intelligence community. (iv) Combining metaheuristics with machine
   learning and data mining techniques.}},

Abstract = {{There are many industries that use highly technological solutions to
   improve quality in all of their products. The steel industry is one
   example. Several automatic surface-inspection systems are used in the
   steel industry to identify various types of defects and to help
   operators decide whether to accept, reroute, or downgrade the material,
   subject to the assessment process. This paper focuses on promoting a
   strategy that considers all defects in an integrated fashion. It does
   this by managing the uncertainty about the exact position of a defect
   due to different process conditions by means of Gaussian additive
   influence functions. The relevance of the approach is in making possible
   consistency and reliability between surface inspection systems. The
   results obtained are an increase in confidence in the automatic
   inspection system and an ability to introduce improved prediction and
   advanced routing models. The prediction is provided to technical
   operators to help them in their decision-making process. It shows the
   increase in improvement gained by reducing the 40 \% of coils that are
   downgraded at the hot strip mill because of specific defects. In
   addition, this technology facilitates an increase of 50 \% in the
   accuracy of the estimate of defect survival after the cleaning facility
   in comparison to the former approach. The proposed technology is
   implemented by means of software-based, multi-agent solutions. It makes
   possible the independent treatment of information, presentation, quality
   analysis, and other relevant functions.}},

   acquisition task (what CSK is acquired from where), technique used (how
   can CSK be acquired), and CSK evaluation methods (how to evaluate the
   acquired CSK). In this survey, we first present a categorization of CSK
   acquisition systems and the great challenges in the field. Then, we
   review and compare the CSK acquisition systems in detail. Finally, we

Title = {{Methodological guidelines for reusing general ontologies}},
Journal = {{DATA \& KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{242-275}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Currently, there is a great deal of well-founded explicit knowledge
   formalizing general notions, such as time concepts and the part\_of
   relation. Yet, it is often the case that instead of reusing ontologies
   that implement such notions (the so-called general ontologies),
   engineers create procedural programs that implicitly implement this
   knowledge. They do not save time and code by reusing explicit knowledge,
   and devote effort to solve problems that other people have already
   adequately solved. Consequently, we have developed a methodology that
   helps engineers to: (a) identify the type of general ontology to be
   reused; (b) find out which axioms and definitions should be reused; (c)
   make a decision, using formal concept analysis, on what general ontology
   is going to be reused; and (d) adapt and integrate the selected general
   ontology in the domain ontology to be developed. To illustrate our
   approach we have employed use-cases. For each use case, we provide a set
   of heuristics with examples. Each of these heuristics has been tested in
   either OWL or Prolog. Our methodology has been applied to develop a
   pharmaceutical product ontology. Additionally, we have carried out a
   controlled experiment with graduated students doing a MCs in Artificial
   Intelligence. This experiment has yielded some interesting findings
   concerning what kind of features the future extensions of the
   methodology should have. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Low-power sensing technologies have emerged for acquiring
   physiologically indicative patient signals. However, to enable devices
   with high clinical value, a critical requirement is the ability to
   analyze the signals to extract specific medical information. Yet given
   the complexities of the underlying processes, signal analysis poses
   numerous challenges. Data-driven methods based on machine learning offer
   distinct solutions, but unfortunately the computations are not well
   supported by traditional DSP. This paper presents a custom processor
   that integrates a CPU with configurable accelerators for discriminative
   machine-learning functions. A support-vector-machine accelerator
   realizes various classification algorithms as well as various kernel
   functions and kernel formulations, enabling range of points within an
   accuracy-versus-energy and -memory trade space. An accelerator for
   embedded active learning enables prospective adaptation of the signal
   models by utilizing sensed data for patient-specific customization,
   while minimizing the effort from human experts. The prototype is
   implemented in 130-nm CMOS and operates from 1.2 V-0.55 V (0.7 V for
   SRAMs). Medical applications for EEG-based seizure detection and
   ECG-based cardiac-arrhythmia detection are demonstrated using clinical
   data, while consuming 273 mu J and 124 mu J per detection, respectively;
   this represents 62.4x and 144.7x energy reduction compared to an
   implementation based on the CPU. A patient-adaptive cardiac-arrhythmia
   detector is also demonstrated, reducing the analysis-effort required for
   model customization by 20x.}},

   Machine (SVM) techniques for groundwater level forecasting in following
   day up to 7-day prediction intervals. Several input combinations
   comprising water table level, rainfall and evapotranspiration values
   from Hongcheon Well station (South Korea), covering a period of eight
   years (2001-2008) were used to develop and test the applied models. The
   data from the first six years were used for developing (training) the
   applied models and the last two years data were reserved for testing. A
   comparison was also made between the forecasts provided by these models
   and the Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) technique. Based on the
   comparisons, it was found that the GEP models could be employed
   successfully in forecasting water table level fluctuations up to 7 days

Abstract = {{In real-life credit scoring applications, the case in which the class of
   defaulters is under-represented in comparison with the class of
   non-defaulters is a very common situation, but it has still received
   little attention. The present paper investigates the suitability and
   performance of several resampling techniques when applied in conjunction
   with statistical and artificial intelligence prediction models over five
   real-world credit data sets, which have artificially been modified to
   derive different imbalance ratios (proportion of defaulters and
   non-defaulters examples). Experimental results demonstrate that the use
   of resampling methods consistently improves the performance given by the
   original imbalanced data. Besides, it is also important to note that in
   general, over-sampling techniques perform better than any under-sampling
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Building artificial agents and robots that can act in an intelligent way
   is one of the main research goals in artificial intelligence and
   robotics. Yet it is still hard to integrate functional cognitive
   processes into these systems. We present a framework combining computer
   vision and machine learning for the learning of object recognition in
   humanoid robots. A biologically inspired, bottom-up architecture is
   introduced to facilitate visual perception and cognitive robotics
   research. It aims to mimic processes in the human brain performing
   visual cognition tasks.
   A number of experiments with this icVision framework are described. We
   showcase both detection and identification in the image plane (2D),
   using machine learning. In addition we show how a biologically inspired
   attention mechanism allows for fully autonomous learning of visual
   object representations. Furthermore localising the detected objects in
   3D space is presented, which in turn can be used to create a model of
   the environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The hippocampus has long been thought to be critical in learning and
   representing the cognitive map, and thus support functions such as
   search, pathfinding and route planning. This work aims to demonstrate
   the utility of hippocampus-based neural networks in modeling human
   search task behavior. Human solutions to pathfinding problems are
   generally fast but approximate, in contrast to traditional Al
   approaches. In this paper, we report data on a human search task, and
   then examine a set of models, based upon the structure of the
   hippocampus, which use a goal scent mechanism similar to the optimal
   pathfinding algorithms used in artificial intelligence systems. We
   compare five distinct search models, and conclude that a goal scent
   model driven by multiple goals spread throughout the search space
   provides the best and most accurate account of the human data. This
   research suggests a convergence in traditional Al and
   biologically-inspired approaches to pathfinding that may be mutually
   beneficial. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Wind power is currently one of the types of renewable energy with a
   large generation capacity. However, operation of wind power generation
   is very challenging because of the intermittent and stochastic nature of
   the wind speed. Wind speed forecasting is a very important part of wind
   parks management and the integration of wind power into electricity
   grids. As an artificial intelligence algorithm, radial basis function
   neural network (RBFNN) has been successfully applied into solving
   forecasting problems. In this paper, a novel approach named
   WTT-SAM-RBFNN for short-term wind speed forecasting is proposed by
   applying wavelet transform technique (WTT) into hybrid model which
   hybrids the seasonal adjustment method (SAM) and the RBFNN. Real data
   sets of wind speed in Northwest China are used to evaluate the
   forecasting accuracy of the proposed approach. To avoid the randomness
   caused by the RBFNN model or the RBFNN part of the hybrid model, all
   simulations in this study are repeated 30 times to get the average.
   Numerical results show that the WTT-SAM-RBFNN outperforms the
   persistence method (PM), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP),
   RBFNN, hybrid SAM and RBFNN (SAM-RBFNN), and hybrid WTT and RBFNN
   (WTT-RBFNN). It is concluded that the proposed approach is an effective
   way to improve the prediction accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Here, we propose an evolutionary algorithm (i.e., evolutionary
   programming) for tuning the weights of a chess engine. Most of the
   previous work in this area has normally adopted co-evolution (i.e.,
   tournaments among virtual players) to decide which players will pass to
   the following generation, depending on the outcome of each game. In
   contrast, our proposed method uses evolution to decide which virtual
   players will pass to the next generation based on the number of
   positions solved from a number of chess grandmaster games. Using a
   search depth of 1-ply, our method can solve 40.78\% of the positions
   evaluated from chess grandmaster games (this value is higher than the
   one reported in the previous related work). Additionally, our method is
   capable of solving 53.08\% of the positions using a historical mechanism
   that keeps a record of the ``good{''} virtual players found during the
   evolutionary process. Our proposal has also been able to increase the
   competition level of our search engine, when playing against the program
   Chessmaster (grandmaster edition). Our chess engine reached a rating of
   2404 points for the best virtual player with supervised learning, and a
   rating of 2442 points for the best virtual player with unsupervised
   learning. Finally, it is also worth mentioning that our results indicate
   that the piece material values obtained by our approach are similar to
   the values known from chess theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In spite of great developments in artificial intelligence, human brain

   explaining, combining complex answers, and abstract reasoning. This
   paper represents a survey of the existing research in the domain of
   intelligent question routing. The survey starts from an original
   presentation paradigm that generalizes the essence of approaches found
   in the open literature. The presentation paradigm includes three basic
   processing stages related to the three major problems of system
   implementation: question analysis, question forwarding, and users'
   knowledge profiling. Various research efforts use different approaches
   for implementation of each one of the basic processing stages. Each
   particular approach is described here using the same template. All these
   approaches are enlisted, discussed, and presented within a table, for
   easier comparison. The outcome of this analysis is a proposal for a new

Abstract = {{Effective health diagnosis provides multifarious benefits such as
   improved safety, improved reliability and reduced costs for operation
   and maintenance of complex engineered systems. This paper presents a
   novel multi-sensor health diagnosis method using deep belief network
   (DBN). DBN has recently become a popular approach in machine learning
   for its promised advantages such as fast inference and the ability to
   encode richer and higher order network structures. The DBN employs a
   hierarchical structure with multiple stacked restricted Boltzmann
   machines and works through a layer by layer successive learning process.
   The proposed multi-sensor health diagnosis methodology using DBN based
   state classification can be structured in three consecutive stages:
   first, defining health states and preprocessing sensory data for DBN
   training and testing; second, developing DBN based classification models
   for diagnosis of predefined health states; third, validating DBN
   classification models with testing sensory dataset. Health diagnosis
   using DBN based health state classification technique is compared with
   four existing diagnosis techniques. Benchmark classification problems
   and two engineering health diagnosis applications: aircraft engine
   health diagnosis and electric power transformer health diagnosis are
   employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. (C) 2013

   resonance between shunt capacitors and inductive elements of the power
   system. In addition, distribution systems are inherently unbalanced due
   to their different loads. Hence, in case shunt capacitors are not
   optimally placed, system unbalance and harmonic level may increase.
   In this article, an attempt was made to achieve optimal capacitor
   placement using a hybrid honey bee colony (HHBC) optimization algorithm
   aiming to minimize power system losses and unbalances and maximize the
   ensuing net saving while maintaining voltage and total harmonic
   distortion (THD) of buses in an acceptable range according to IEEE
   standards. To include the presence of harmonics, the method was
   integrated with a three-phase harmonic power flow algorithm. Having
   defined a special fitness function, effects of power system unbalances
   and harmonics, were taken into account. The proposed method were tested
   on two unbalanced distorted radial distribution test systems (including
   an IEEE 25-bus and a modified IEEE 37-bus) with and without the presence
   of DGs. Simulation results have been compared with those from standard
   artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and other such artificial
   intelligence techniques as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm
   optimization (PSO), and imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA). These
   results suggest that the proposed methodology offer acceptable numerical
   accuracy, robustness and efficiency and demonstrate that the proposed
   approach may outperform other artificial intelligence techniques. (C)

Abstract = {{Secondary phases such as Laves and carbides are formed during the final
   solidification stages of nickel based superalloy coatings deposited
   during the gas tungsten arc welding cold wire process. However, when
   aged at high temperatures, other phases can precipitate in the
   microstructure, like the gamma `' and delta phases. This work presents a
   new application and evaluation of artificial intelligent techniques to
   classify (the background echo and bacicscattered) ultrasound signals in
   order to characterize the microstructure of a Ni-based alloy thermally
   aged at 650 and 950 degrees C for 10,100 and 200 h. The background echo
   and backscattered ultrasound signals were acquired using transducers
   with frequencies of 4 and 5 MHz. Thus with the use of features
   extraction techniques, i.e., detrended fluctuation analysis and the
   Hurst method, the accuracy and speed in the classification of the
   secondary phases from ultrasound signals could be studied. The
   classifiers under study were the recent optimum-path forest (OPF) and
   the more traditional support vector machines and Bayesian. The
   experimental results revealed that the OPF classifier was the fastest
   and most reliable. In addition, the OPF classifier revealed to be a
   valid and adequate tool for microstructure characterization through
   ultrasound signals classification due to its speed, sensitivity,
   accuracy and reliability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of explanation has received attention from different areas
   in Computer Science, particularly in the knowledge-based systems and
   expert systems communities. At the same time, argumentation has evolved
   as a new paradigm for conceptualizing commonsense reasoning, resulting
   in the formalization of different argumentation frameworks and the
   development of several real-world argument-based applications. Although
   the notions of explanation and argument for a claim share many common
   elements in knowledge-based systems their interrelationships have not
   yet been formally studied in the context of the current argumentation
   research in Artificial Intelligence. This article explores these ideas
   by providing a new perspective on how to formalize dialectical
   explanation support for argument-based reasoning. To do this, we propose
   a formalization of explanations for abstract argumentation frameworks
   with dialectical constraints where different emerging properties are
   studied and analyzed. As a concrete example of the formalism introduced
   we show how it can be fleshed out in an implemented rule-based
   argumentation system. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a novel class of facility location problems,
   and propose solutions based on Voronoi diagrams. Our solutions locate a
   set of facilities on a two dimensional space, with respect to a set of
   dynamic demand. The information about these demand is gathered through
   modifications of the overall system, into a central decision unit. This
   influences our objective of minimizing the total loss function.
   Considering a continuous space and discrete time, facilities are
   assigned to meet demands in each time cycle. Two distinct approaches are
   proposed and thoroughly studied, followed by a case study. We call our
   main algorithm Reactive Agent Dynamic Voronoi Diagram Facility Spread.
   We also test our solutions empirically through a set of experiments.
   Considering n and p to be the number of demand points, and the number of
   facilities in hand, respectively, the time complexity of the algorithm
   is O(c(n(2) + p)logn). for a complete run of c cycles. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{Air traffic demand is an important factor in the planning, design and
   construction of airport facilities. Although population, national
   income, import, export and the numerical strength of the labor force
   have rapidly increased in the last ten years in Kuwait; an analysis of
   the current impact of these factors on air traffic demand is lacking in
   literature.
   The main objectives of this study were to (a) determine the main factors
   that affect air traffic demand in Kuwait; (b) calibrate a regression
   model regressing air demand and the causal factors, (c) to apply
   artificial intelligence software (NeuroShell) as a technique for
   forecasting air travel demand, and (d) compare the regression and
   artificial intelligence model results, and select the best models to
   forecast air travel demand for Kuwait.
   Findings have indicated that national income and labor force were the
   main factors affecting air travel demand in Kuwait. The developed models
   all predicted the demand for air travel with high accuracy. The
   (NeuroShell) models were selected as the choice of forecasting model for
   Kuwait due to their better ``goodness of fit{''} over other regression

   with algorithms implemented, in software, on commercially available
   substation computing hardware to identify computation timescales and
   investigate algorithm robustness when presented with measurement error.

Abstract = {{Computer systems designed to support teamwork are environments that
   enable and enhance collaboration among users. These systems, named
   groupware, incorporate techniques that facilitate communication and
   coordination among team members to improve group performance. However,
   as not all team members are identical, it is important to study users'
   characteristics to build more productive teams.
   Team Roles Theory allows obtaining the best possible performance taking
   into account individual skills, combining the weaknesses of each role
   with the strengths of other team members. Therefore, it is essential in
   group formation to consider mind the role each member is capable of
   playing. Currently, each team member has to complete lengthy
   questionnaires to determine his team role.
   We propose an approach for automatic detection of team roles from the
   observation of user interactions in CSCW systems. Particularly, we apply
   Artificial Intelligence to obtain the team role that best suits a user's
   characteristics and behaviours. To achieve this, the performance of
   various classification algorithms was analyzed. The results show that
   our approach can detect team roles with high degrees of precision.}},

Abstract = {{Particle swarm optimization (PSO), a relatively new population-based
   intelligence algorithm, exhibits good performance on optimization
   problems. However, during the optimization process, the particles become
   more and more similar, and gather into the neighborhood of the best
   particle in the swarm, which makes the swarm prematurely converged most
   likely around the local solution. A new optimization algorithm called
   multifrequency vibrational PSO is significantly improved and tested for
   two different test cases: optimization of six different benchmark test
   functions and direct shape optimization of an airfoil in transonic flow.
   The algorithm emphasizes a new mutation application strategy and
   diversity variety, such as global random diversity and local controlled
   diversity. The results offer insight into how the mutation operator
   affects the nature of the diversity and objective function value. The
   local controlled diversity is based on an artificial neural network. As
   far as both the demonstration cases' problems are considered, remarkable
   reductions in the computational times have been accomplished.}},

   multistage stochastic programming. The decision rules are based on a
   statistical model inferred from a given scenario-tree solution and are
   selected by out-of-sample simulation given the true problem. Because the
   learned rules depend on the given scenario tree, we repeat the procedure
   for a large number of randomly generated scenario trees and then select
   the best solution (policy) found for the true problem. The scheme leads
   to an ex post selection of the scenario tree itself. Numerical tests
   evaluate the dependence of the approach on the machine learning aspects
   and show cases where one can obtain near-optimal solutions, starting
   with a ``weak{''} scenario-tree generator that randomizes the branching
   structure of the trees.}},

Abstract = {{Face recognition has become more significant and relevant in recent
   years owing to it potential applications. Since the faces are highly
   dynamic and pose more issues and challenges to solve, researchers in the
   domain of pattern recognition, computer vision and artificial
   intelligence have proposed many solutions to reduce such difficulties so
   as to improve the robustness and recognition accuracy. As many
   approaches have been proposed, efforts are also put in to provide an
   extensive survey of the methods developed over the years. The objective
   of this paper is to provide a survey of face recognition papers that
   appeared in the literature over the past decade under all severe
   conditions that were not discussed in the previous survey and to
   categorize them into meaningful approaches, viz. appearance based,
   feature based and soft computing based. A comparative study of merits
   and demerits of these approaches have been presented.}},

Abstract = {{The successful high throughput screening of molecule libraries for a
   specific biological property is one of the main improvements in drug
   discovery. The virtual molecular filtering and screening relies greatly
   on quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, a
   mathematical model that correlates the activity of a molecule with
   molecular descriptors. QSAR models have the potential to reduce the
   costly failure of drug candidates in advanced (clinical) stages by
   filtering combinatorial libraries, eliminating candidates with a
   predicted toxic effect and poor pharmacokinetic profiles, and reducing
   the number of experiments. To obtain a predictive and reliable QSAR
   model, scientists use methods from various fields such as molecular
   modeling, pattern recognition, machine learning or artificial
   intelligence. QSAR modeling relies on three main steps: molecular
   structure codification into molecular descriptors, selection of relevant
   variables in the context of the analyzed activity, and search of the
   optimal mathematical model that correlates the molecular descriptors
   with a specific activity. Since a variety of techniques from statistics
   and artificial intelligence can aid variable selection and model
   building steps, this review focuses on the evolutionary computation
   methods supporting these tasks. Thus, this review explains the basic of
   the genetic algorithms and genetic programming as evolutionary
   computation approaches, the selection methods for high-dimensional data
   in QSAR, the methods to build QSAR models, the current evolutionary
   feature selection methods and applications in QSAR and the future trend
   on the joint or multi-task feature selection methods.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the quantifier-free languages, Bc and Bc(omicron), obtained
   by augmenting the signature of Boolean algebras with a unary predicate
   representing, respectively, the property of being connected, and the
   property of having a connected interior. These languages are interpreted
   over the regular closed sets of R-n (n >= 2) and, additionally, over the
   regular closed semilinear sets of R-n. The resulting logics are examples
   of formalisms that have recently been proposed in the Artificial
   Intelligence literature under the rubric Qualitative Spatial Reasoning.
   We prove that the satisfiability problem for Bc is undecidable over the
   regular closed semilinear sets in all dimensions greater than 1, and
   that the satisfiability problem for Bc and Bc(omicron) is undecidable
   over both the regular closed sets and the regular closed semilinear sets
   in the Euclidean plane. However, we also prove that the satisfiability
   problem for Bc(omicron) is NP-complete over the regular closed sets in
   all dimensions greater than 2, while the corresponding problem for the
   regular closed semilinear sets is EXPTIME-complete. Our results show, in
   particular, that spatial reasoning is much harder over Euclidean spaces
   than over arbitrary topological spaces.}},

   or pier. The architecture modeling was done using PASSI methodology for
   the design of agent-oriented systems, and the implementation was done in
   JADE, a Java-based development environment for multiagent systems. To
   validate the resulting support system, tests were carried out in which

Abstract = {{There is accumulating evidence that driver distraction is a leading
   cause of vehicle crashes and incidents. In particular, increased use of
   so-called in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) and partially autonomous
   driving assistance systems (PADAS) have raised important and growing
   safety concerns. Thus, detecting the driver's state is of paramount
   importance, to adapt IVIS and PADAS accordingly, therefore avoiding or
   mitigating their possible negative effects. The purpose of this paper is
   to show a method for the nonintrusive and real-time detection of visual
   distraction, using vehicle dynamics data and without using the
   eye-tracker data as inputs to classifiers. Specifically, we present and
   compare different models that are based on well-known machine learning
   (ML) methods. Data for training the models were collected using a static
   driving simulator, with real human subjects performing a specific
   secondary task {[}i.e., a surrogate visual research task (SURT)] while
   driving. Different training methods, model characteristics, and feature
   selection criteria have been compared. Based on our results, using a
   support vector machine (SVM) has outperformed all the other ML methods,
   providing the highest classification rate for most of the subjects.
   Potential applications of this paper include the design of an adaptive
   IVIS and of a ``smarter{''} PADAS.}},

Abstract = {{The main task of coal producers is to provide for sufficient quantifies
   of coal of required quality with minimum costs of excavation. Therefore,
   the prediction of energy values is the most important task aiming to
   secure the optimal usage of coal energy value. The goal of paper is to
   identify, examines and evaluate most influential artificial intelligence
   algorithms that have been widely used in the data mining community, on a
   real problem of predicting coal quality. Our researches are based on the
   data achieved under laboratory conditions during the period of five
   years (2005-2010), and include 33256 coal samples from ``Kreka{''} Coal
   Mine Company. The goal of the research is to build, based on the
   described data, a prediction model that will be used for predicting the
   coal quality class of unknown samples. Four algorithms have been
   identified: C4.5, kNN, Naive Bayes and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The
   idea is to find the best model through the following stages: each of the
   algorithms is calibrated in order to find appropriate model division
   techniques which maximize the performance of the algorithms, to assess
   the importance of input attributes and ultimate comparison of the
   algorithm orders them with respect to their performance. The final
   evaluation of the outcomes allowed singling out the MLP to be the best
   predicting methods for the given domain with optimal structure for
   input, hidden and output layer.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a procedure for transforming hyperspectral imaging
   information into intra-growth ring wood densities is presented.
   Particular focus was given to comparing the neural network and Partial
   Least Squares Regression (PLSR) processing methods. The hyperspectral
   measurements were performed in a wavelength range of 380-1028 nm, with a
   spatial separation of 79 mu m. The study employed 34 samples from the
   same number of Pinus pinea tree samples. Density values were analyzed at
   a total of 34,093 positions in the samples. For neural networks, the
   mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and standard deviation of absolute
   percentage error (StdAPE) values were 6.49\% and 5.43\%, respectively.
   For the PLSR method the MAPE and StdAPE were 6.87\% and 5.70\%,
   respectively. The neural networks allow reducing the percentage of
   sample positions with large errors. The proposed method for density
   measurement can be used for dendrochronology and dendroclimatology. (C)

Abstract = {{Laser milling (LM) can be classified as a layer manufacturing process in
   which the material is removed by a laser beam by means of the ablation
   mechanism. It is a laser machining process which uses a laser beam to
   produce 3D shapes into a wide variety of materials. It is also known as
   laser ablation. It shows clear advantages versus the traditional milling
   such as the unlimited choice of materials, the direct use of
   computer-aided design structure data, the high geometric flexibility,
   and the touchless tool. LM requires the selection of optimal machining
   parameters for the job. Unlike the mechanical milling and the mechanical
   incision, the depth of the single removed layer is chosen at the
   beginning as input parameter of the process. In LM, the ablated depth
   depends from the process parameters such as laser power, scan speed,
   pulse duration, and pulse frequency. This work aims to develop an
   algorithm that can predict the parameters necessary to execute the
   material removal with a preset ablation depth. Using the results of an
   experimental campaign, the laser milling process was modeled by means of
   a back-propagation artificial neural network. Then, an iterative
   algorithm, based on the previous trained neural network, permitted to
   calculate the scanning velocity and pulse frequency that approached for
   the best the preset ablation depth. The developed approach represents a
   mean for the rational selection of laser ablation process parameters. It
   can be performed in an intuitive manner since it uses simple artificial
   intelligence like the artificial neural network.}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation is a critical task in image processing. Bi-level
   segmentation involves dividing the whole image into partitions based on
   a threshold value, whereas multilevel segmentation involves multiple
   threshold values. A successful segmentation assigns proper threshold
   values to optimise a criterion such as entropy or between-class
   variance. High computational cost and inefficiency of an exhaustive
   search for the optimal thresholds leads to the use of global search
   heuristics to set the optimal thresholds. An emerging area in global
   heuristics is swarm-intelligence, which models the collective behaviour
   of the organisms. In this paper, two successful swarm-intelligence-based
   global optimisation algorithms, particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and
   artificial bee colony (ABC), have been employed to find the optimal
   multilevel thresholds. Kapur's entropy, one of the maximum entropy
   techniques, and between-class variance have been investigated as fitness
   functions. Experiments have been performed on test images using various
   numbers of thresholds. The results were assessed using statistical tools
   and suggest that Otsu's technique, PSO and ABC show equal performance
   when the number of thresholds is two, while the ABC algorithm performs
   better than PSO and Otsu's technique when the number of thresholds is
   greater than two. Experiments based on Kapur's entropy indicate that the
   ABC algorithm can be efficiently used in multilevel thresholding.
   Moreover, segmentation methods are required to have a minimum running
   time in addition to high performance. Therefore, the CPU times of ABC
   and PSO have been investigated to check their validity in real-time. The
   CPU time results show that the algorithms are scalable and that the
   running times of the algorithms seem to grow at a linear rate as the
   problem size increases. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deregulation process has created an intense competition with the
   participation of many generating companies (GENCOs) in a power market.
   Wholesale transactions (bids and offer) have to be cleared and settled
   in a shorter duration. Therefore, this necessitates for the system
   operator to quick and smarter decisions. In this problem formulation,
   profit based unit commitment (PBUC) problem aims in maximizing the
   profit of GENCOs. However demand satisfaction is not an obligation.
   Here, parallel nodal ant colony optimization (PNACO) approach mimicking
   ant's intelligence is used in the decision on committing generating
   units. The sub problem economic dispatch (ED) is carried out using
   parallel artificial bee colony (PABC) approach mimicking foraging
   behavior of bees. Profit based unit commitment (PBUC) must be obtained
   in less time even though there is a possible increase in generating
   units. Nowadays, as computing resources are available in plenty,
   effective utilization will be advantageous for reducing the time
   complexity for a large scale power system solution. The proposed
   approach uses a cluster of computers performing parallel operations in a
   distributed environment for obtaining the PBUC solution. The time
   complexity and the solution quality with respect to the number of
   processors in the cluster are thoroughly investigated. The effectiveness
   of the proposed approach for PBUC is first validated on a standard 10
   unit system available in the literature and then analysis for
   computational efficiency using 1000 generating units, which is a
   duplicate form of standard 10 unit system. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new nature-inspired algorithm (NA)-mosquito
   host-seeking algorithm (MHSA)-the inspiration for which comes from the
   host-seeking behavior of mosquitoes. Applying the algorithm to the
   traveling salesman problem (TSP), every city pair is treated as an
   artificial mosquito, and the TSP solving process is transformed into the
   host-seeking behavior of a swarm of artificial mosquitoes. We study the
   evolution of ``swarms{''}, the artificial mosquitoes' microcosmic
   actions, and macroscopic swarm intelligence, and present efficient
   solutions to TSP using MHSA. The proposed MHSA is fundamentally
   different from the other popular NAs in its motivation, principle, the
   optimization mechanism, its elements and their states, and the
   biological model, the mathematical model and theoretical foundation on
   which it is based. We show that (1) MHSA can converge; (2) its parameter
   setting does not depend on algorithm learning or prior knowledge; and
   (3) MHSA can describe complex behaviors and dynamics. The properties of
   MHSA, including correctness, convergence and stability, are discussed in
   details. Simulation results attest to the effectiveness and suitability
   of MHSA. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Modeling medical decision making by support vector machines, explaining
   by rules of evolutionary algorithms with feature selection}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2677-2686}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Machine learning support for medical decision making is truly helpful
   only when it meets two conditions: high prediction accuracy and a good
   explanation of how the diagnosis was reached. Support vector machines
   (SVMs) successfully achieve the first target due to a kernel-based
   engine; evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can greatly accomplish the second
   owing to their adaptable nature. In this context, the current paper puts
   forward a two-step hybridized methodology, where learning is accurately
   performed by the SVMs and a comprehensible emulation of the resulting
   decision model is generated by EAs in the form of propositional rules,
   while referring only those indicators that highly influence the class
   separation. An individual highlighting of the medical attributes that
   trigger a specific diagnosis for a current patient record is
   additionally obtained; this feature thus increases the confidence of the
   physician in the resulting automated diagnosis. Without loss of
   generality, we aim to model three breast cancer instances, for reasons
   of both high incidence of the disease and the large application of state
   of the art artificial intelligence methods for this medical task. As
   such, the prediction of a benign/malignant condition as well as the
   recurrence/nonrecurrence of a cancer event are studied on the Wisconsin
   corresponding data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The
   proposed hybridization reached its goals. Rule prototypes evolve against
   a SVM consistent training data, while diversity among the different
   classes is implicitly preserved. Feature selection eventually leads to a
   resulting rule set where only the significant medical indicators
   together with the discriminating threshold values are referred, while
   individual relevance of attributes can be additionally obtained for each
   patient. The gain is thus dual: the EA benefits from a noise-free SVM
   preprocessed data and the resulting SVM model is able to output rules in
   a comprehensible, concise format for the physician. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Pages = {{27-34}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Number sequence problems appear frequently in IQ tests, where the task
   is to extrapolate finite sequences of integers. This paper presents a
   computational method for solving number sequence problems appearing in
   IQ tests. The assumption that these problems are solvable by humans is
   actively exploited to keep the computational complexity manageable. The
   method combines elements of artificial intelligence and cognitive
   psychology and is referred to as anthropomorphic because it makes use of
   a model of human reasoning. This model features a set of cognitive
   resources, a repertoire of patterns that encode integer sequences, and a
   notion of bounded computation for decoding patterns. The model
   facilitates the search for patterns matching a given integer sequence by
   quickly discarding many patterns on the grounds that they are too
   demanding to decode. The computational method was implemented as a
   computer program called Asolver and then tested against the programs
   Mathematica and Maple. On the number sequence problems of the IQ test
   PJP, Asolver scored above IQ 140, whereas the other programs scored
   below IQ 100. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless body area network (WBAN) is a promising candidate for future
   health monitoring system. Nevertheless, the path to mature solutions is
   still facing a lot of challenges that need to be overcome. Energy
   efficient scheduling is one of these challenges given the scarcity of
   available energy of biosensors and the lack of portability. Therefore,
   researchers from academia, industry and health sectors are working
   together to realize practical solutions for these challenges. The main
   difficulty in WBAN is the uncertainty in the state of the monitored
   system. Intelligent learning approaches such as a Markov Decision
   Process (MDP) were proposed to tackle this issue. A Markov Decision
   Process (MDP) is a form of Markov Chain in which the transition matrix
   depends on the action taken by the decision maker (agent) at each time
   step. The agent receives a reward, which depends on the action and the
   state. The goal is to find a function, called a policy, which specifies
   which action to take in each state, so as to maximize some utility
   functions (e. g., the mean or expected discounted sum) of the sequence
   of rewards. A partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) is
   a generalization of Markov decision processes that allows for the
   incomplete information regarding the state of the system. In this case,
   the state is not visible to the agent. This has many applications in
   operations research and artificial intelligence. Due to incomplete
   knowledge of the system, this uncertainty makes formulating and solving
   POMDP models mathematically complex and computationally expensive.
   Limited progress has been made in terms of applying POMPD to real
   applications. In this paper, we surveyed the existing methods and
   algorithms for solving POMDP in the general domain and in particular in
   Wireless body area network (WBAN). In addition, the papers discussed
   recent real implementation of POMDP on practical problems of WBAN. We
   believe that this work will provide valuable insights for the newcomers
   who would like to pursue related research in the domain of WBAN.}},

Abstract = {{An aircraft system mainly relies on a Global Positioning System (GPS) to
   provide accurate position values consistently. However, GPS receivers
   may encounter frequent GPS absence because of ephemeric error, satellite
   clock error, multipath error, and signal jamming. To overcome these
   drawbacks, generally a GPS is integrated with an Inertial Navigation
   System (INS) mounted inside the vehicle to provide a reliable navigation
   solution. INS and GPS are commonly integrated using a Kalman filter (KF)
   to provide a robust navigation solution. In the KF approach, the error
   models of both INS and GPS are required; this leads to the complexity of
   the system. This research work presents new position update architecture
   (NPUA) which consists of various artificial intelligence neural networks
   (AINN) that integrate both GPS and INS to overcome the drawbacks of the
   Kalman filter. The various AINNs that include both static and dynamic
   networks described for the system are radial basis function neural
   network (RBFNN), backpropagation neural network (BPN), forward-only
   counter propagation neural network (FCPN), full counter propagation
   neural network (Full CPN), adaptive resonance theory-counter propagation
   neural network (ART-CPN), constructive neural network (CNN),
   higher-order neural networks (HONN), and input-delayed neural networks
   (IDNN) to predict the INS position error during GPS absence, resulting
   in different performances. The performances of the different AINNs are
   analyzed in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), performance index
   (PI), number of epochs, and execution time (ET).}},

Abstract = {{When dealing with transportation problems Operational Research (OR), and
   related areas as Artificial Intelligence (AI), have focused mostly on
   uni-modal transport problems. Due to the current existence of bigger
   international logistics companies, transportation problems are becoming
   increasingly more complex. One of the complexities arises from the use
   of intermodal transportation. Intermodal transportation reflects the
   combination of at least two modes of transport in a single transport
   chain, without a change of container for the goods. In this paper, a new
   hybrid approach is described which addresses complex intermodal
   transport problems. It combines OR techniques with AI search methods in
   order to obtain good quality solutions, by exploiting the benefits of
   both kinds of techniques. The solution has been applied to a real world
   problem from one of the largest Spanish companies using intermodal

Abstract = {{Domotics, concerned with the realization of intelligent home
   environments, is a novel field which can highly benefit from solutions
   inspired by service-oriented principles to enhance the convenience and
   security of modern home residents. In this work, we present an
   architecture for a smart home, starting from the lower device
   interconnectivity level up to the higher application layers that
   undertake the load of complex functionalities and provide a number of
   services to end-users. We claim that in order for smart homes to exhibit
   a genuinely intelligent behavior, the ability to compute compositions of
   individual devices automatically and dynamically is paramount. To this
   end, we incorporate into the architecture a composition component that
   employs artificial intelligence domain-independent planning to generate
   compositions at runtime, in a constantly evolving environment. We have
   implemented a fully working prototype that realizes such an
   architecture, and have evaluated it both in terms of performance as well
   as from the end-user point of view. The results of the evaluation show
   that the service-oriented architectural design and the support for
   dynamic compositions is quite efficient from the technical point of
   view, and that the system succeeds in satisfying the expectations and
   objectives of the users.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of high speed communication technology, global
   positioning system (GPS) and artificial intelligence (Al) techniques,
   there has been a paradigm shift in the parlance of power grid operation
   and control. The power system is in a phase of transition towards smart
   grid with the aid of these techniques to combat against contingencies,
   leading to reduction of failures and blackouts. The transmission lines
   are considered to be the back bone of the grid and traverse over
   difficult terrains. With the advancements in digital relaying and
   wide-area protection along with GPS technology, philosophy of protection
   has also undergone a paradigm change to take care of such challenges.
   This paper explores the possibility of transmission line protection for
   multi-generator system using wavelet Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA)
   technique along with GPS. The inputs for the wavelet transform are the
   synchronized currents measured by remote telemetry units (RTUs) in
   conjunction with GPS technology at different buses. The classification
   algorithm uses wavelet MRA technique to extract features of the
   transient current signals based on harmonics generated due to abrupt
   change of currents in a three-phase transmission line caused by
   different faults. The major contribution of this paper is that the
   classification algorithm is immune to the effects of fault inception
   angle, fault impedance, fault distance and power angle. The results
   validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm for real time smart grid
   operation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Reducing unnecessary lab testing in the ICU with artificial intelligence}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To reduce unnecessary lab testing by predicting when a
   proposed future lab test is likely to contribute information gain and
   thereby influence clinical management in patients with gastrointestinal
   bleeding. Recent studies have demonstrated that frequent laboratory
   testing does not necessarily relate to better outcomes.
   Design: Data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification were
   performed and an artificial intelligence tool, fuzzy modeling, was used
   to identify lab tests that do not contribute an information gain. There
   were 11 input variables in total. Ten of these were derived from bedside
   monitor trends heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate,
   temperature, blood pressure, and urine collections, as well as infusion
   products and transfusions. The final input variable was a previous value
   from one of the eight lab tests being predicted: calcium, PTT,
   hematocrit, fibrinogen, lactate, platelets, INR and hemoglobin. The
   outcome for each test was a binary framework defining whether a test
   result contributed information gain or not.
   Patients: Predictive modeling was applied to recognize unnecessary lab
   tests in a real world ICU database extract comprising 746 patients with
   gastrointestinal bleeding. Main results: Classification accuracy of
   necessary and unnecessary lab tests of greater than 80\% was achieved
   for all eight lab tests. Sensitivity and specificity were satisfactory
   for all the outcomes. An average reduction of 50\% of the lab tests was
   obtained. This is an improvement from previously reported similar
   studies with average performance 37\% by {[}1-3].
   Conclusions: Reducing frequent lab testing and the potential clinical
   and financial implications are an important issue in intensive care. In
   this work we present an artificial intelligence method to predict the
   benefit of proposed future laboratory tests. Using ICU data from 746
   patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, and eleven measurements, we
   demonstrate high accuracy in predicting the likely information to be
   gained from proposed future lab testing for eight common GI related lab
   tests. Future work will explore applications of this approach to a range
   of underlying medical conditions and laboratory tests. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Shunt active power filters have been widely used for power quality
   improvement. With the advancement in artificial intelligence techniques,
   the applications of fuzzy logic-based control systems have increased
   manifolds. This paper proposes a reduced rule fuzzy logic controller
   (FLC) in the voltage control loop of a shunt active power filter (APF),
   which is approximating a conventional large rule FLC. The difference
   between the controlled outputs of two controllers is compensated by
   proposed compensating factors. The dynamic response and harmonic
   compensation performance of proposed 4-rule approximated fuzzy logic
   controller (AFLC) is compared with 25-rule FLC. A three-phase shunt APF
   is used for harmonic and reactive power compensation. The proposed
   scheme is tested with randomly varying single and multiple non-linear
   loads. The simulation results presented under transient and steady-state
   conditions confirm that the proposed 4-rule AFLC efficiently
   approximates the 25-rule FLC. The proposed control methodology takes
   less computational time and computational memory as the numbers of rules
   are reduced significantly.}},

   an artificial intelligence practice Moodle's course on the CLIPS

   with the feedback that they provide to instructors making decisions
   about how to improve quizzes and courses. Finally, starting with the
   information provided by the rules, the CLIPS quiz and course have been

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Feature selection is an active area of research in pattern recognition,
   machine learning and artificial intelligence, which greatly improves the
   performance of forecasting or classification. In rough set theory,
   attribute reduction, as a special form of feature selection, aims to
   retain the discernability of the original attribute set. To solve this
   problem, many heuristic attribute reduction algorithms have been
   proposed in the literature. However, these methods are computationally
   time-consuming for large scale datasets. Recently, an accelerator was
   introduced by computing reducts on gradually reducing the size of the
   universe. Although the accelerator can considerably shorten the
   computational time, it remains a challenging issue. To further enhance
   the efficiency of these algorithms, we develop a new accelerator for
   attribute reduction, which simultaneously reduces the size of the
   universe and the number of attributes at each iteration of the process
   of reduction. Based on the new accelerator, several representative
   heuristic attribute reduction algorithms are accelerated. Experiments
   show that these accelerated algorithms can significantly reduce
   computational time while maintaining their results the same as before.

Abstract = {{The NVIDIA (R) OptiX (TM) ray tracing engine is a programmable system
   designed for NVIDIA GPUs and other highly parallel architectures. The
   OptiX engine builds on the key observation that most ray tracing
   algorithms can be implemented using a small set of programmable
   operations. Consequently, the core of OptiX is a domain-specific
   just-in-time compiler that generates custom ray tracing kernels by
   combining user--supplied programs for ray generation, material shading,
   object intersection, and scene traversal. This enables the
   implementation of a highly diverse set of ray tracing-based algorithms
   and applications, including interactive rendering, offline rendering,
   collision detection systems, artificial intelligence queries, and
   scientific simulations such as sound propagation. OptiX achieves high

Title = {{Reducing consistency checks in generating corrective explanations for
   interactive constraint satisfaction}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Constraint satisfaction problem has many applications in Artificial
   Intelligence. Its interactive applications usually require advice from a
   system to help a user solve the problem. Based on maximal relaxations,
   the CORRECTIVEEXP algorithm is a representative method to compute
   explanations. However, we found that the CORRECTIVERELAX algorithm, used
   by the CORRECTIVEEXP algorithm to compute maximal relaxations, has a
   defect that it executes more consistency checks than necessary. It is
   very important to avoid these unnecessary consistency checks because in
   general each consistency check needs to resort to backtrack search. To
   tackle this problem, this paper proposes two improved algorithms to
   compute maximal relaxations, called CORRECTIVERELAXREDUCED and
   CORRECTIVERELAXDC respectively. The former utilizes the existing results
   of consistency checks to shrink the search scope for some inconsistent
   user constraints. Furthermore, we have proved that the number of
   consistency checks executed by the CORRECTIVEREIAXREDUCED algorithm is
   always less than or equals to that of the CORRECTIVERELAX algorithm. The
   latter uses a divide-and-conquer approach to avoid unnecessary
   consistency checks. Our experimental results show that the two improved
   algorithms execute less consistency checks than CORRECTIVEEXP while
   computing maximal relaxations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Recently, significant advances have been made in ROBOTICS, ARTIFICIAL
   INTELLIGENCE and other COGNITIVE related fields, allowing to make much
   sophisticated biomimetic robotics systems. In addition, enormous number
   of robots have been designed and assembled, explicitly realize
   biological oriented behaviors. Towards much skill behaviors and adequate
   grasping abilities (i.e. ARTICULATION and DEXTEROUS MANIPULATION), a new
   phase of dexterous hands have been developed recently with
   biomimetically oriented and bio-inspired functionalities. In this
   respect, this manuscript brings a detailed survey of biomimetic based
   dexterous robotics multi-fingered hands. The aim of this survey, is to
   find out the state of the art on dexterous robotics end-effectors, known
   in literature as (ROBOTIC HANDS) or (DEXTEROUS MULTI-FINGERED) robot
   hands. Hence, this review finds such biomimetic approaches using a
   framework that permits for a common description of biological and
   technical based hand manipulation behavior. In particular, the
   manuscript focuses on a number of developments that have been taking
   place over the past two decades, and some recent developments related to
   this biomimetic field of research. In conclusions, the study found that,
   there are rich research efforts in terms of KINEMATICS, DYNAMICS,
   MODELING and CONTROL methodologies. The survey is also indicating that,
   the topic of biomimetic inspired robotics systems make significant
   contributions to robotics hand design, in four main directions for
   future research. First, they provide a genuine world test of models of
   biologically inspired hand designs and dexterous manipulation behaviors.
   Second, they provide novel manipulation articulations and mechanisms
   available for industrial and domestic uses, most notably in the field of
   human like hand design and real world applications. Third, this survey
   has also indicated that, there are quite large number of attempts to
   acquire biologically inspired hands. These attempts were almost
   successful, where they exposed more novel ideas for further
   developments. Such inspirations were directed towards a number of topics
   related (HAND MECHANICS AND DESIGN), (HAND TACTILE SENSING), (HAND FORCE
   SENSING), (HAND SOFT ACTUATION) and (HAND CONFIGURATION AND TOPOLOGY).
   FOURTH, in terms of employing Al related sciences and cognitive
   thinking, it was also found that, rare and exceptional research attempts
   were directed towards the employment of biologically inspired thinking,
   i.e. (Al, BRAIN AND COGNITIVE SCIENCES) for hand upper control and
   towards much sophisticated dexterous movements. Throughout the study, it
   has been found there are number of efforts in terms of mechanics and
   hand designs, tactical sensing, however, for hand soft actuation, it
   seems this area of research is still far away from having a realistic
   muscular type fingers and hand movements. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{The main drawback of most metaheuristics is the absence of effective
   stopping criteria. Most implementations of such algorithms stop after
   performing a given maximum number of iterations or a given maximum
   number of consecutive iterations without improvement in the best-known
   solution value, or after the stabilization of the set of elite solutions
   found along the search. We propose effective probabilistic stopping
   rules for randomized metaheuristics such as GRASP (Greedy Randomized
   Adaptive Search Procedures). We show how the probability density
   function of the solution values obtained along the iterations of such
   algorithms can be used to implement stopping rules based on the tradeoff
   between solution quality and the time needed to find a solution that
   might improve the best solution found. We show experimentally that, in
   the particular case of GRASP heuristics, the solution values obtained
   along its iterations fit a normal distribution that may be used to give
   an online estimation of the number of solutions obtained in forthcoming
   iterations that might be at least as good as the incumbent. This
   estimation is used to validate the stopping rule based on the tradeoff
   between solution quality and the time needed to find a solution that
   might improve the incumbent. The robustness of this strategy is
   illustrated and validated by a thorough computational study reporting
   results obtained with GRASP implementations to four different
   combinatorial optimization problems.}},

Abstract = {{Multiagent systems (MASs) consist of several autonomous entities, called
   agents, that interact with each other to either fulfill their own
   interests (competition) or reach a common goal (cooperation). In MASs,
   negotiation is the key form of interaction that enables groups of agents
   to arrive at a mutual agreement regarding some belief, goal, or plan.
   The aim of this study is to develop a MAS that simulates the negotiation
   process between parties (mainly contractor and client) about risk
   allocation and sharing of cost overruns in construction projects. The
   MAS was developed using three different negotiation protocols:
   time-dependent concession, Zeuthen's strategy, and Zeuthen's strategy
   with Bayesian learning. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the
   effect of reservation value, first-offer value, and negotiation protocol
   on the settlement amounts. The model was also tested on three
   hypothetical cases. Results show that it is mainly the reservation value
   that determines the settlement amount of the negotiation. The developed
   system can be used by decision makers to understand how the risks and
   associated costs are shared between parties under different scenarios.

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on improving rainfall-runoff forecasts by a
   combination of genetic programming (GP) and basic hydrological modelling
   concepts. GP is a general optimisation technique for making an automated
   search of a computer program that solves some particular problem. The
   SORD! program was developed for the purposes of this study (in the R
   programming language). It is an implementation of canonical GP. Special
   functions are used for a combined approach of hydrological concepts and
   GP. The special functions are a reservoir model, a simple moving average
   model, and a cumulative sum and delay operator. The efficiency of the
   approach presented here is tested on runoff predictions for five
   catchments of various sizes. The input data consists of daily rainfall
   and runoff series. The forecast step is one day. The performance of the
   proposed approach is compared with the results of the artificial neural
   network model (ANN) and with the GP model without special functions. GP
   combined with these concepts provides satisfactory performance, and the
   simulations seem to be more accurate than the results of ANN and GP
   without these functions. An additional advantage of the proposed
   approach is that it is not necessary to determine the input lag, and
   there is better convergence. The SORD! program provides an easy-to-use
   alternative for data-oriented modelling combined with simple concepts
   used in hydrological modelling.}},

   methods for multi-step seasonal time series forecasting. All the
   presented methods stem from computational intelligence techniques:
   evolutionary artificial neural networks, support vector machines and
   genuine linguistic fuzzy rules. Performance of the suggested methods is
   experimentally justified on seasonal time series from distinct domains
   on three forecasting horizons. The most important contribution is the
   introduction of a new hybrid combination using linguistic fuzzy rules
   and the other computational intelligence methods. This hybrid
   combination presents competitive forecasts, when compared with the
   popular ARIMA method. Moreover, such hybrid model is more easy to
   interpret by decision-makers when modeling trended series. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this paper, an artificial bee colony algorithm is proposed to solve
   the maximally diverse grouping problem. This complex optimisation
   problem consists of forming maximally diverse groups with restricted
   sizes from a given set of elements. The artificial bee colony algorithm
   is a new swarm intelligence technique based on the intelligent foraging
   behaviour of honeybees. The behaviour of this algorithm is determined by
   two search strategies: an initialisation scheme employed to construct
   initial solutions and a method for generating neighbouring solutions.
   More specifically, the proposed approach employs a greedy constructive
   method to accomplish the initialisation task and also employs different
   neighbourhood operators inspired by the iterated greedy algorithm. In
   addition, it incorporates an improvement procedure to enhance the
   intensification capability. Through an analysis of the experimental
   results, the highly effective performance of the proposed algorithm is
   shown in comparison to the current state-of-the-art algorithms which
   address the problem. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Field D{*} path-finding on weighted triangulated and tetrahedral meshes}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Classic shortest path algorithms operate on graphs, which are suitable
   for problems that can be represented by weighted nodes or edges. Finding
   a shortest path through a set of weighted regions is more difficult and
   only approximate solutions tend to scale well. The Field D{*} algorithm
   efficiently calculates an approximate, interpolated shortest path
   through a set of weighted regions and was designed for navigating robots
   through terrains with varying characteristics. Field D{*} operates on
   unit grid or quad-tree data structures, which require high resolutions
   to accurately model the boundaries of irregular world structures. In
   this paper, we extend the Field D{*} cost functions to 2D triangulations
   and 3D tetrahedral meshes: structures which model polygonal world
   structures more accurately. Since robots typically have limited
   resources available for computation and storage, we pay particular
   attention to computation and storage overheads when detailing our
   extensions. We begin by providing analytic solutions to the minimum of
   each cost function for 2D triangles and 3D tetrahedra. Our triangle
   implementation provides a 50 \% improvement in performance over an
   existing triangle implementation. While our 3D extension to tetrahedra
   is the first full analytic extension of Field D{*} to 3D, previous work
   only provided an approximate minimization for a single cost function on
   a 3D cube with unit lengths. Each cost function is expressed in terms of
   a general function whose characteristics can be exploited to reduce the
   calculations required to find a minimum. These characteristics can also
   be exploited to cache the majority of cost functions, producing a
   speedup of up to 28 \% in the 3D tetrahedral case. We demonstrate that,
   in environments composed of non-grid aligned data, Multi-resolution
   quad-tree Field D{*} requires an order of magnitude more faces and
   between 15 and 20 times more node expansions, to produce a path of
   similar cost to one produced by a triangle implementation of Field D{*}
   on a lower resolution triangulation. We provide examples of 3D pathing
   through models of complex topology, including pathing through anatomical
   structures extracted from a medical data set. To summarise, this paper
   details a robust and efficient extension of Field D{*} pathing to data
   sets represented by weighted triangles and tetrahedra, and also provides
   empirical data which demonstrates the reduction in storage and
   computation costs that accrue when one chooses such a representation
   over the more commonly used quad-tree and grid-based alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new two-population based global search algorithm, the

   problems by using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Statistical Test with

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanisms governing the regeneration capabilities of
   many organisms is a fundamental interest in biology and medicine. An
   ever-increasing number of manipulation and molecular experiments are
   attempting to discover a comprehensive model for regeneration, with the
   planarian flatworm being one of the most important model species.
   Despite much effort, no comprehensive, constructive, mechanistic models
   exist yet, and it is now clear that computational tools are needed to
   mine this huge dataset. However, until now, there is no database of
   regenerative experiments, and the current genotype-phenotype ontologies
   and databases are based on textual descriptions, which are not
   understandable by computers. To overcome these difficulties, we present
   here Planform (Planarian formalization), a manually curated database and
   software tool for planarian regenerative experiments, based on a
   mathematical graph formalism. The database contains more than a thousand
   experiments from the main publications in the planarian literature. The
   software tool provides the user with a graphical interface to easily
   interact with and mine the database. The presented system is a valuable
   resource for the regeneration community and, more importantly, will pave
   the way for the application of novel artificial intelligence tools to
   extract knowledge from this dataset.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes that the flocking behavior of birds can guide the
   design of a robust, scalable and self-adaptive congestion control
   protocol in the context of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The proposed
   approach adopts a swarm intelligence paradigm inspired by. the
   collective behavior of bird flocks. The main idea is to `guide' packets
   (birds) to form flocks and flow towards the sink (global attractor),
   whilst trying to avoid congestion regions (obstacles). The direction of
   motion of a packet flock is influenced by repulsion and attraction
   forces between packets, as well as the field of view and the artificial
   magnetic field in the direction of the artificial magnetic pole (sink).
   The proposed approach is simple to implement at the individual node,
   involving minimal information exchange. In addition, it displays global
   self-{*} properties and emergent behavior, achieved collectively without
   explicitly programming these properties into individual packets.
   Performance evaluations show the effectiveness of the proposed
   Flock-based Congestion Control (Flock-CC) mechanism in dynamically
   balancing the offered load by effectively exploiting available network
   resources and moving packets to the sink. Furthermore, Flock-CC provides
   graceful performance degradation in terms of packet delivery ratio,
   packet loss, delay and energy tax under low, high and extreme traffic
   loads. In addition, the proposed approach achieves robustness against
   failing nodes, scalability in different network sizes and outperforms
   typical conventional approaches. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of compressive strength of no-slump concrete to its
   ingredient materials and proportions, necessitate the use of robust
   models to guarantee both estimation and generalization features. It was
   known that the problem of compressive strength prediction owes high
   degree of complexity and uncertainty due to the variable nature of
   materials, workmanship quality, etc. Moreover, using the chemical and
   mineral additives, superimposes the problem's complexity. Traditionally
   this property of concrete is predicted by conventional linear or
   nonlinear regression models. In general, these models comprise lower
   accuracy and in most cases they fail to meet the extrapolation accuracy
   and generalization requirements. Recently, artificial intelligence-based
   robust systems have been successfully implemented in this area. In this
   regard, this paper aims to investigate the use of optimized support
   vector machine (SVM) to predict the compressive strength of no-slump
   concrete and compare with optimized neural network (ANN). The results
   showed that after optimization process, both models are applicable for
   prediction purposes with similar high-qualities of estimation and
   generalization norms; however, it was indicated that optimization and
   modeling with SVM is very rapid than ANN models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel technique for allocating information
   gathering actions in settings where agents need to choose among several
   alternatives, each of which provides a stochastic outcome to the agent.
   Samples of these outcomes are available to agents prior to making
   decisions and obtaining further samples is associated with a cost. The
   paper formalizes the task of choosing the optimal sequence of
   information gathering actions in such settings and establishes it to be
   NP-Hard. It suggests a novel estimation technique for the optimal number
   of samples to obtain for each of the alternatives. The approach takes
   into account the trade-offs associated with using prior samples to
   choose the best alternative and paying to obtain additional samples.
   This technique is evaluated empirically in several different settings
   using real data. Results show that our approach was able to
   significantly outperform alternative algorithms from the literature for
   allocating information gathering actions in similar types of settings.
   These results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach as an efficient,

Abstract = {{Motion planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) constitutes a domain
   of research where several disciplines meet, ranging from artificial
   intelligence and machine learning to robot perception and computer
   vision. In view of the plurality of related applications such as
   planetary exploration, search and rescue, agriculture, mining and
   off-road exploration, the aim of the present survey is to review the
   field of 3D terrain traversability analysis that is employed at a
   preceding stage as a means to effectively and efficiently guide the task
   of motion planning. We identify that in the epicenter of all related
   methodologies, 3D terrain information is used which is acquired from
   LIDAR, stereo range data, color or other sensory data and occasionally
   combined with static or dynamic vehicle models expressing the
   interaction of the vehicle with the terrain. By taxonomizing the various
   directions that have been explored in terrain perception and analysis,
   this review takes a step toward agglomerating the dispersed
   contributions from individual domains by elaborating on a number of key
   similarities as well as differences, in order to stimulate research in
   addressing the open challenges and inspire future developments. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper addresses an information-extraction problem that aims to
   identify semantic relations among medical concepts (problems, tests, and
   treatments) in clinical text. The objectives of the paper are twofold.
   First, we extend an earlier one-page description (appearing as a part of
   {[}5]) of a top-ranked model in the 2010 I2B2 NLP Challenge to a
   necessary level of details, with the belief that feature design is the
   most crucial factor to the success of our system and hence deserves a
   more detailed discussion. We present a precise quantification of the
   contributions of a wide variety of knowledge sources. In addition, we
   show the end-to-end results obtained on the noisy output of a top-ranked
   concept detector, which could help construct a more complete view of the
   state of the art in the real-world scenario. As the second major
   objective, we reformulate our models into a composite-kernel framework
   and present the best result, according to our knowledge, on the same
   dataset. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights

   Fuzzy clustering, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization are

   more systematic. ANNs have also been applied successfully in the fuzzy
   relationship determination stage. In this study, we propose a new hybrid
   fuzzy time-series approach in which fuzzy c-means clustering procedure
   is employed in the fuzzification stage and feed-forward neural networks
   are used in the fuzzy relationship determination stage. This study also
   includes an empirical analysis pertaining to the forecasting of Index

Abstract = {{Ranking web pages for presenting the most relevant web pages to user's
   queries is one of the main issues in any search engine. In this paper,
   two new ranking algorithms are offered, using Reinforcement Learning
   (RL) concepts. RL is a powerful technique of modern artificial
   intelligence that tunes agent's parameters, interactively. In the first
   step, with formulation of ranking as an RL problem, a new
   connectivity-based ranking algorithm, called RL Rank, is proposed. In RL
   Rank, agent is considered as a surfer who travels between web pages by
   clicking randomly on a link in the current page. Each web page is
   considered as a state and value function of state is used to determine
   the score of that state (page). Reward is corresponded to number of out
   links from the current page. Rank scores in RL Rank are computed in a
   recursive way. Convergence of these scores is proved. In the next step,
   we introduce a new hybrid approach using combination of BM25 as a
   content-based algorithm and RL Rank. Both proposed algorithms are
   evaluated by well known benchmark datasets and analyzed according to
   concerning criteria. Experimental results show using RL concepts leads
   significant improvements in raking algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

   which combines Hooke-Jeeves pattern search with artificial bee colony

   realized by artificial bee colony algorithm and the exploitation phase
   completed by pattern search. The proposed algorithm was tested on a
   comprehensive set of benchmark functions, encompassing a wide range of
   dimensionality. Results show that the new algorithm is promising in
   terms of convergence speed, solution accuracy and success rate. The
   performance of artificial bee colony algorithm is much improved by
   introducing a pattern search method, especially in handling functions
   having narrow curving valley, functions with high eccentric ellipse and

Abstract = {{Narrative data provide rich information and knowledge to the workers.
   However, existing systems mainly served as a workflow system, a
   reporting system, or a database system for storing this kind of
   information. The massive amount of unstructured narrative data makes it
   extremely difficult to be shared and reused. Actual knowledge sharing
   and reuse among the workers is still limited. This paper presents a
   Computational Knowledge Elicitation and Sharing System which attempts to
   elicit knowledge from individuals as well as a team and converts it into
   a structured format and shared among the team. The proposed system
   accomplishes several current technologies in knowledge-based system,
   artificial intelligence and natural language processing, which converts
   the narrative knowledge of knowledge workers into a concept mapping
   representation. With a sufficient number of narratives, patterns are
   revealed and an aggregate concept map for all participating members is
   produced. It converts the unstructured text into a more structured
   format which helps to summarize and share the knowledge that can be
   taken in handling different case management issues. Such integration is
   considered to be novel. A prototype system has been implemented based on
   the method successfully in the mental healthcare of a social service

Abstract = {{The major challenge for contemporary enterprises is to make products
   fulfill customers' expectations. Conceptual design is the foundation of
   the development process, as it starts from the customer needs
   identification and decides about the whole product life cycle. Quality
   function deployment (QFD) helps to extract product characteristics from
   customer demands. Optimization of the product development process
   requires different product variant information at the early stage of
   product development. At the early designing stage, designers lack
   sufficient product information and have difficulty in determining it.
   The idea of the paper is to provide measurable engineering information
   for the quality function deployment method. For this purpose, a chosen
   artificial intelligence method was used. In the experiment, artificial
   neural network (NN) was applied. The results of analyses show that the
   intelligent estimation methods are useful and effective. The methods of
   estimation consist of four stages: goal setting, data acquisition,
   configuration of NN architecture, fulfilling of the QFD matrix. Finally,
   to illustrate the procedure of the chosen engineering characteristic
   estimation, a toothed gear box example was used.}},

Abstract = {{Image segmentation is one of the significant computational applications
   of the biomedical field. Automated computational methodologies are
   highly preferred for medical image segmentation since these techniques
   are immune to human perception error. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based
   techniques are often used for this process since they are superior to
   other automated techniques in terms of accuracy and convergence time
   period. Fuzzy systems hold a significant position among the AI
   techniques because of their high accuracy. Even though these systems are
   exceptionally accurate, the time period required for convergence is
   exceedingly high. In this work, a novel distance metric-based fuzzy
   C-means (FCM) algorithm is proposed to tackle the low-convergence-rate
   problem of the conventional fuzzy systems. This modified approach
   involves the concept of distance-based dimensionality reduction of the
   input vector space that substantially reduces the iterative time period
   of the conventional FCM algorithm. The effectiveness of the modified FCM
   algorithm is explored in the context of magnetic resonance brain tumor
   image segmentation. Experimental results show promising results for the
   proposed approach in terms of convergence time period and segmentation
   efficiency. Thus, this algorithm proves to be highly feasible for
   time-oriented real-time applications.}},

Abstract = {{Humans can perceive and learn new information from novel, previously
   unknown to them kinds of experiences, which can be very challenging for
   an artificial system. Here, a cognitive architecture is presented that
   uses its emotional intelligence to learn new concepts from previously
   unknown kinds of experiences. The underlying principle is that emotional
   appraisals of experience expressed internally as several MoNADs help the
   architecture to detect conceptual novelty and facilitate the generation
   and learning of new concepts. With the goal of measuring effects of
   emotional cognition on learning, the architecture was implemented in a
   robot and studied in a number of paradigms involving variable color
   settings. The key findings are the following. Initially, the dynamic
   state of the model neural network does not converge to some attractor
   when it receives an unknown kind of input. On the other hand, it quickly
   converges to an attractor in response to a familiar input. With time,
   the system develops the ability to learn previously unknown categories
   and concepts as new MoNAD. It is proposed that the model simulates a
   subliminal response of a human brain to an unknown situation. The
   findings have broad implications for future emotional artificial
   intelligence. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In cement plant, since all processes are chemical and irreversible,
   monitoring and control is a critical factor. If the process is not
   controlled at any stage, the final product can be damaged or lost. Thus,
   in such environments, considering the quality of the product at each
   state. is essential. Also, to control the process, communication among
   different parts of production line is essential. The wasted time in
   production line has a direct effect on process correction time and
   cement production performance. Here, a model of a new intelligent
   multi-agent quality control system (IMAQCS) for controlling the quality
   of cement production processes is suggested. This model, using of
   rule-based artificial intelligence technique, concentrates on
   relationship between departments in cement production line to monitor
   multi-attribute quality factors. With the presence of agents for
   controlling the quality of cement processes, real-time analyzing and
   decision making in a fault condition will be provided. In order to
   validate the proposed model, IMAQCS is deployed in real plants of a
   cement industries complex in Iran. The ability of the system in the
   process production environment is assessed. The effectiveness and
   efficiency of the system are demonstrated by reducing the process
   correction time and increasing the cement production performance.
   Finally, this system can effectively impact on factory resources and
   cost saving. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling of financial time series with artificial intelligence is
   difficult due to the random nature of the data. The moving average
   filter is a common and simple form of filter to reduce this noise. There
   are several of these noise reduction methods used throughout the
   financial security trading community. The major issue with these filters
   is the lag between the filtered data and the noisy data. This lag only
   increases as more noise reduction is desired. In the present
   marketplace, where investors are competing for quality and timely
   information, lag can be a hindrance. This paper proposes a new moving
   average filter derived with the aim of maximizing the level of noise
   reduction at each delay. Comparison between five different methods has
   been done and experiment results have shown that our method is a
   superior noise reducer to the alternatives over short and middle range

Abstract = {{Robots are gradually being introduced as part of our life. With the
   advances in computational power and sophisticated sensors, home safety
   is being ensured with the help of robots. This study proposes SSPR, a
   SIP-enabled Surveillance Patrol Robot which tracks a moving object
   actively and informs the householder of security issues for the home
   environment. Such a robot is equipped with a camera and is aware of
   session initiation protocol (SIP). When SSPR senses a moving object, it
   starts tracking and initiates a SIP call to the mobile device of the
   householder. SIP will establish both audio and video streams between
   SSPR and the mobile device. Thus, the householder is able to get the
   whole picture of the home status through his/her mobile device. With the
   mobility support in SIP, SSPR can switch its wireless link adaptively to
   another access point (AP) and the audio and video streams will continue
   after handoff. As a result, SSPR can complement the security routine and
   make a home smarter and safer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   management of a microgrid is proposed using artificial intelligence
   techniques jointly with linear-programming-based multiobjective
   optimization. The proposed multiobjective intelligent energy management
   aims to minimize the operation cost and the environmental impact of a
   microgrid, taking into account its preoperational variables as future
   availability of renewable energies and load demand (LD). An artificial
   neural network ensemble is developed to predict 24-h-ahead photovoltaic
   generation and 1-h-ahead wind power generation and LD. The proposed
   machine learning is characterized by enhanced learning model and
   generalization capability. The efficiency of the microgrid operation
   strongly depends on the battery scheduling process, which cannot be
   achieved through conventional optimization formulation. In this paper, a
   fuzzy logic expert system is used for battery scheduling. The proposed
   approach can handle uncertainties regarding to the fuzzy environment of
   the overall microgrid operation and the uncertainty related to the
   forecasted parameters. The results show considerable minimization on
   operation cost and emission level compared to literature microgrid
   energy management approaches based on opportunity charging and Heuristic
   Flowchart (HF) battery management.}},

Abstract = {{Choosing the most suitable subset of descriptors among a large number of
   structural parameters is one of the most important and challenging steps
   in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. So far,
   many feature selection algorithms have been applied in these studies,
   but none of them behave generally. In this study, a binary version of
   gravitational search algorithm (GSA) as a novel feature selection method
   is developed and coded for QSAR studies. The GSA is applied as a
   descriptor selection tool for anticancer potency modeling of a set of
   imidazo{[}4,5-b]pyridine derivatives consisting of 65 compounds. The GSA
   selected descriptors were subjected to Bayesian regularized artificial
   neural networks to model the anticancer potency. The generated model
   satisfactorily describes the experimental variation in the biological
   activity of the data set compounds. The results of external validation
   R-v(2) = 0.98) and internal cross-validation tests (Q(LOO)(2) = 0.94,
   R-L4O(2) = 0.93, R-L8O(2) = 0.92) in conjunction with Y-randomization
   confirm the predictive ability, robustness and effectiveness of the
   generated model. Also, comparison between GSA and genetic algorithm (GA)
   indicates that GSA has certain advantages over the GA. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   learning and forgetting techniques, the underlying knowledge base can be
   optimized, thus leading to a significant reduction on the computing time
   for on-line operation. The performance of the cognitive estimator is
   evaluated in a long haul and in an ultra-long haul network, and we
   demonstrate that it achieves more than 98\% successful classifications,
   and that it is up to four orders of magnitude faster when compared with
   a non-cognitive QoT estimator, the Q-Tool.}},

Abstract = {{The oscillation of frequency in power grid is studied in this paper. The
   possibility association of frequencies measured at different locations
   are modeled by a Bayesian network with the logical structure learned
   using Bayesian structure learning and real measurements in the U. S.
   power grid. Frequency data analysis and the detection of incorrect
   frequency measurements (caused by equipment error or malicious attack)
   are performed over the logical Bayesian network structure. Such
   application of Bayesian network is a powerful mathematical tool in
   computational intelligence. Without the physical power network topology
   information, a two-branch search-and-score structure learning algorithm
   with L-1 regulation is proposed to learn the logical structure,
   achieving around 97\% correct prediction rate for future frequency and
   92\% detection rate for false frequency data with 2\% false alarm rate.
   The tool of epidemic propagation over this logical network is also
   exploited to analyze the propagation of frequency changes. Using the
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, such logical structure is demonstrated to be
   well approximated by the Small World network model. And the propagation
   of frequency changes is demonstrated to be described by the
   Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model quite well. The Bayesian
   structure obtained from the real measurement is statistically validated
   using a 5-fold training data and the Pearson system.}},

Abstract = {{Stock market is a type of investment where with proper strategies and

   gain. The use of intelligent computational strategies can help the
   investor in this decision. From this viewpoint, this paper proposes an
   intelligent hybrid system that combines forecasting techniques with
   heuristic rules to give subsidies to the investor in the transaction in
   the stock market. To show functionality of the system we performed
   several studies in which we can close that the information provided by
   the system gave the investor possibility of higher gain (\$) as well as

Abstract = {{Despite the improving accuracy of agent-based expert systems, human
   expert users aided by these systems have not improved their accuracy.
   Self-affirmation theory suggests that human expert users could be
   experiencing threat, causing them to act defensively and ignore the
   system's conflicting recommendations. Previous research has demonstrated
   that affirming an individual in an unrelated area reduces defensiveness
   and increases objectivity to conflicting information. Using an
   affirmation manipulation prior to a credibility assessment task, this
   study investigated if experts are threatened by counterattitudinal
   expert system recommendations. For our study, 178 credibility assessment
   experts from the American Polygraph Association (n = 134) and the
   European Union's border security agency Frontex (n = 44) interacted with
   a deception detection expert system to make a deception judgment that
   was immediately contradicted. Reducing the threat prior to making their
   judgments did not improve accuracy, but did improve objectivity toward
   the system. This study demonstrates that human experts are threatened by
   advanced expert systems that contradict their expertise. As more and
   more systems increase integration of artificial intelligence and
   inadvertently assail the expertise and abilities of users, threat and
   self-evaluative concerns will become an impediment to technology
   acceptance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel bee colony optimization approach to
   the nurse rostering problem. The bee colony optimization algorithm is
   motivated by the foraging habits of honey bees. In iterations,
   artificial bees collectively improve their solutions. The developed
   algorithm alternates constructive and local search phases. In the
   constructive phase, unscheduled shifts are assigned to available nurses,
   while the aim of local search phase is to improve the quality of the
   solution. The algorithm incorporates a novel intelligent discarding of
   portions of large neighborhoods for which it is predicted that they will
   not lead to the improvement of the objective function. Performance of
   the algorithm was evaluated on real-world data from hospitals in
   Belgium. The results show that the bee colony optimization is able to
   efficiently find solutions that are competitive compared to the
   solutions produced by other algorithms reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the radial basis function (RBF) spatial interpolation
   method was used to estimate the potential water heads through an earthen
   dam. The multiquadric (MQ) function was used to discretize the seepage
   governing partial differential equation and related boundary conditions.
   The function contains a shape coefficient of c, which plays an important
   role in model calibration. Therefore, the coefficient of c was first
   optimized via Hardy and cross validation methods, and then, by employing
   the optimal c (c(opt)), two scenarios of modeling with and without
   considering the internal conditions were provided and the results were
   compared with the results of the finite difference method (FDM). In the
   next step, an artificial neural network was used for handling the
   nonlinear time variability of the phenomenon to cope with the
   limitations of the FDM and RBF methods in temporal modeling. Thus, by
   training neural networks for the piezometers located in the core, the
   potential time series of water were predicted and their results were
   imposed upon the RBF method as the internal conditions, along with the
   boundary conditions for spatial-temporal modeling of the water heads.
   Finally, the assumed time-invariant inherency of c was confirmed by the
   cross-validation method. The results show no notable time variation in
   time series of c(opt), and therefore, it can be concluded that the value
   of the shape coefficient in MQ formulations generally depends on the
   geometry of the problem rather than the temporal variation of the
   boundary conditions. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000200. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Planning the motion of multiple robots deals with computing the motion
   of all robots avoiding any collision. This article focuses on the use of
   hybrid Multi Neuron Heuristic Search (MNHS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA).
   The MNHS is an advancement over the conventional A{*} algorithm and is
   better suited for maze-like conditions where there is a high degree of
   uncertainty. The MNHS contributes toward optimality of the solution, and
   the GA gives it an iterative nature and enables the approach to be used
   on high-resolution maps. MNHS works over the set of points returned by
   the GA in its fitness function evaluation. A priority-based approach is
   used, in which the priorities are decided by the GA. Path feasibility is
   speeded up by using the concept of coarser-to-finer lookup called
   momentum. Experimental results show that the combined approach is able
   to easily solve the problem for a variety of scenarios. {[}Supplementary

Abstract = {{Evolving game agents in a first-person shooter game is important to game
   developers and players. Choosing a proper set of parameters in a
   multiplayer game is not a straightforward process because consideration
   must be given to a large number of parameters, and therefore requires
   effort and thorough knowledge of the game. Thus, numerous artificial
   intelligence (AI) techniques are applied in the designing of game
   characters' behaviors. This study applied a genetic algorithm to evolve
   a team in the mode of One Flag CTF in Quake III Arena to behave
   intelligently. The source code of the team AI is modified, and the
   progress of the game is represented as a finite state machine. A fitness
   function is used to evaluate the effect of a team's tactics in certain
   circumstances during the game. The team as a whole evolves
   intelligently, and consequently, effective strategies are discovered and
   applied in various situations. The experimental results have
   demonstrated that the proposed evolution method is capable of evolving a
   team's behaviors and optimizing the commands in a shooter game. The
   evolution strategy enhances the original game AI and assists game
   designers in tuning the parameters more effectively. In addition, this
   adaptive capability increases the variety of a game and makes gameplay
   more interesting and challenging.}},

Abstract = {{The Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) Methodology
   Technical Committee recommends the method engineering approach for
   Multi-agent System (MAS) development. This approach consists in defining
   method fragments for agent-oriented software engineering, and then
   developers combine these fragments to define customized development
   processes. In this line of research, the contribution of this paper is a
   collection of novel method fragments that are assisted with model
   transformations, in order to allow engineers to better develop MASs in
   an automated way. Some of these fragments also include explicit advices
   for incorporating artificial intelligence in the development. In the
   experiments, two processes have been composed with these method
   fragments for two different agent-oriented methodologies (i.e. Ingenias
   and Adelfe). This paper shows how these processes are respectively used
   to develop two known MASs (i.e. Delphi MAS and Timetable MAS).
   Furthermore, the presented approach is evaluated with 24 developers that
   were randomly divided into two groups. Each developer designed a MAS
   satisfying the same common requirements. One group applied the current
   approach, while the other group did not. The results show that this
   approach reduces the 63.3\% of the designing time in average for MASs.

   Dominos using a genetic algorithm (GA). The evaluation function
   comprises terms incorporating game strategies defined as: punctuating,
   facilitating future moves, and complicating opponents' moves.
   Coefficients were defined to determine the importance of each term of
   the evaluation function and a set of parameters and operators for
   implementing the GA. The players' ability was calculated by the number
   of wins in 5000 matches. The results obtained during the simulations

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is to present a new computational tool for

   This new tool uses the fuzzy relation paradigm to identify the F trace

   was very extensively tested with ionosondes that operate at low
   latitudes and near the equatorial region. The ionograms used in this
   work were recorded at Sao Jose dos Campos (23.2 degrees S, 45.9 degrees
   W; dip latitude 17.6 degrees S) and Palmas (10.2 degrees S, 48.2 degrees
   W; dip latitude 5.5 degrees S). These automatically extracted
   ionospheric parameters were compared with those obtained manually and a
   good agreement was found. The developed tool will greatly expedite and
   standardize ionogram processing. Therefore, this new tool will
   facilitate exchange of information among many groups that operate
   ionosondes of the CADI type, and will be very helpful for space weather

Abstract = {{Scientific cost prediction is the foundation for formulating a business
   plan, which helps enterprises to determine the target costs and to
   control the operating costs. In today's world, quantitative methods are
   crucial for prediction purposes in cost management. On the basis of
   studying some typical methods of cost prediction, we propose a cost
   prediction method based on an improved fuzzy model. Firstly, owning to
   the inefficiency of existing fuzzifier, such that it is difficult to
   determine the number of fuzzy rules, we present an improved fuzzy
   c-means (FCM) fuzzifier to solve this problem referring to
   ``granulation-degranulation{''} strategy and sample error function.
   Secondly, a fuzzy model based on the improved FCM fuzzifier is
   constructed through combining Takagi-Sugen-Kang fuzzy inference system.
   The algorithm of the improved fuzzy model is also realized by this
   study. Finally, through a series of experimental analyses for steel
   number product and steel class product of certain machinery enterprise,
   the results have demonstrated that the proposed method has the better
   prediction accuracy, which can be used effectively and practically in
   real-world cost prediction.}},

Abstract = {{In the most basic application of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a set of
   artificial ants find the shortest path between a source and a
   destination. Ants deposit pheromone on paths they take, preferring paths
   that have more pheromone on them. Since shorter paths are traversed
   faster, more pheromone accumulates on them in a given time, attracting
   more ants and leading to reinforcement of the pheromone trail on shorter
   paths. This is a positive feedback process that can also cause trails to
   persist on longer paths, even when a shorter path becomes available. To
   counteract this persistence on a longer path, ACO algorithms employ
   remedial measures, such as using negative feedback in the form of
   uniform evaporation on all paths. Obtaining high performance in ACO
   algorithms typically requires fine tuning several parameters that govern
   pheromone deposition and removal. This paper proposes a new ACO
   algorithm, called EigenAnt, for finding the shortest path between a
   source and a destination, based on selective pheromone removal that
   occurs only on the path that is actually chosen for each trip. We prove
   that the shortest path is the only stable equilibrium for EigenAnt,
   which means that it is maintained for arbitrary initial pheromone
   concentrations on paths, and even when path lengths change with time.
   The EigenAnt algorithm uses only two parameters and does not require
   them to be finely tuned. Simulations that illustrate these properties
   are provided.}},

   Lewisian in the sense that they validate the principles in Lewis's
   well-known logic of counterfactuals. I then develop a system sound and
   complete with respect to this class. The resulting logic is the weakest
   logic of causal counterfactuals that respects Lewis's principles, sits
   in between the logic developed by Galles and Pearl and the logic
   developed by Halpern, and stands to Galles and Pearl's logic in the same

Abstract = {{When subjected to a very high-pH, most of the soil minerals undergo
   physico-chemical transformation. This could induce strong modifications
   of the shear strength behaviour of the soil. This issue is of high
   interest in the framework of the design of deep nuclear wastes
   repositories, since the degradation of the concrete lining of deep
   galleries after thousands of years will generate an alkaline solute (pH
   > 12) that would circulate through the backfill, and alter its
   hydromechanical characteristics. A study was undertaken to assess the
   impact of high-pH fluid circulation on the shear strength behaviour of a
   backfill material. Because of the complexity of the existing
   constitutive theories, a new approach was used, based on evolutionary
   polynomial regression (EPR), for modelling of these processes. EPR is an
   evolutionary data mining technique that generates a transparent and
   structured representation of the behaviour of a system directly from
   data. An EPR model was developed and validated using results from a
   comprehensive set of triaxial tests. Through a sensitivity analysis, the
   EPR model permitted to identify the specific surface, and to a lesser
   extent the micropore void ratio, as coupling parameters between
   hydromechanical behaviour alteration during alkaline fluid circulation
   and a physical process. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a generic problem with many
   applications in different areas of artificial intelligence and
   operational research. During the search for a solution, the order in
   which the variables are selected to be instantiated has a tremendous
   impact in the complexity of the search. Many heuristics exist for
   ordering these variables, but they are specialized for some types of
   instances. Hyper-heuristics are methodologies used to choose from a set
   of heuristics and decide which one to apply given some properties of the
   instance at hand. In this research, we propose a new type of
   hyper-heuristic based on a learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural
   network for variable ordering within CSP. The first part of the
   investigation describes a methodology to generate LVQ neural networks
   that are able to map some properties of the instances to one suitable
   variable ordering heuristic. Later, the networks are created according
   to such methodology and tested on random and real instances proving that
   they are a feasible method to improve the performance of search on CSP
   when compared to single heuristics applied in isolation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Product configuration can be defined as the task of tailoring a product
   according to the specific needs of a customer. Due to the inherent
   complexity of this task, which for example includes the consideration of
   complex constraints or the automatic completion of partial
   configurations, various Artificial Intelligence techniques have been
   explored in the last decades to tackle such configuration problems. Most
   of the existing approaches adopt a single-site, centralized approach. In
   modern supply chain settings, however, the components of a customizable
   product may themselves be configurable, thus requiring a multisite,
   distributed approach. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of
   modeling and solving such distributed configuration problems and propose
   an approach based on Distributed Constraint Satisfaction. In particular,
   we advocate the use of Generative Constraint Satisfaction for knowledge
   modeling and show in an experimental evaluation that the use of generic
   constraints is particularly advantageous also in the distributed problem
   solving phase.}},

Abstract = {{The current trend for building an ontology-based data management system
   (DMS) is to capitalize on efforts made to design a preexisting
   well-established DMS (a reference system). The method amounts to
   extracting from the reference DMS a piece of schema relevant to the new
   application needs-a module-, possibly personalizing it with extra
   constraints w.r.t. the application under construction, and then managing
   a data set using the resulting schema. In this paper, we extend the
   existing definitions of modules and we introduce novel properties of
   robustness that provide means for checking easily that a robust
   module-based DMS evolves safely w.r.t. both the schema and the data of
   the reference DMS. We carry out our investigations in the setting of
   description logics which underlie modern ontology languages, like RDFS,
   OWL, and OWL2 from W3C. Notably, we focus on the DL-liteA dialect of the
   DL-lite family, which encompasses the foundations of the QL profile of
   OWL2 (i.e., DL-liteR): the W3C recommendation for efficiently managing

Abstract = {{The dynamic online job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is formulated
   based on the classical combinatorial optimization problem - JSSP with
   the assumption that new jobs continuously arrive at the job shop in a
   stochastic manner with the existence of unpredictable disturbances

   inherent uncertainty and complexity. This paper models this class of
   problem as a multi-objective problem and solves it by hybridizing the
   artificial intelligence method of artificial immune systems (AIS) and
   priority dispatching rules (PDRs). The immune network theory of AIS is
   applied to establish the idiotypic network model for priority
   dispatching rules to dynamically control the dispatching rule selection
   process for each operation under the dynamic environment. Based on the
   defined job shop situations, the dispatching rules that perform best
   under specific environment conditions are selected as antibodies, which
   are the key elements to construct the idiotypic network. Experiments are
   designed to demonstrate the efficiency and competitiveness of this
   model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Usually, vehicle applications need to use artificial intelligence
   techniques to implement control strategies able to deal with the noise
   in the signals provided by sensors, or with the impossibility of having
   full knowledge of the dynamics of a vehicle (engine state, wheel
   pressure, or occupants' weight).
   This work presents a cruise control system which is able to manage the
   pedals of a vehicle at low speeds. In this context, small changes in the
   vehicle or road conditions can occur unpredictably. To solve this
   problem, a method is proposed to allow the on-line evolution of a
   zero-order TSK fuzzy controller to adapt its behaviour to uncertain road
   or vehicle dynamics.
   Starting from a very simple or even empty configuration, the consequents
   of the rules are adapted in real time, while the membership functions
   used to codify the input variables are modified after a certain period
   of time. Extensive experimentation in both simulated and real vehicles
   showed the method to be both fast and precise, even when compared with a
   human driver. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A support vector machine-based context-ranking model for question

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{Modern information technologies and Internet services are suffering from
   the problem of selecting and managing a growing amount of textual
   information, to which access is often critical. Machine learning
   techniques have recently shown excellent performance and flexibility in
   many applications, such as artificial intelligence and pattern
   recognition. Question answering (QA) is a method of locating exact
   answer sentences from vast document collections. This paper presents a
   machine learning-based question-answering framework, which integrates a
   question classifier, simple document/passage retrievers, and the
   proposed context-ranking models. The question classifier is trained to
   categorize the answer type of the given question and instructs the
   context-ranking model to re-rank the passages retrieved from the initial
   retrievers. This method provides flexible features to learners, such as
   word forms, syntactic features, and semantic word features. The proposed
   context-ranking model, which is based on the sequential labeling of
   tasks, combines rich features to predict whether the input passage is
   relevant to the question type. We employ TREC-QA tracks and question
   classification benchmarks to evaluate the proposed method. The
   experimental results show that the question classifier achieves 85.60\%
   accuracy without any additional semantic or syntactic taggers, and
   reached 88.60\% after we employed the proposed term expansion techniques
   and a predefined related-word set. In the TREC-10 QA task, by using the
   gold TREC-provided relevant document set, the QA model achieves a 0.563
   mean reciprocal rank (MRR) score, and a 0.342 MRR score is achieved
   after using the simple document and passage retrieval algorithms. (C)

Abstract = {{Plan recognition is a ubiquitous task in artificial intelligence and
   pervasive computing research. The multigoal recognition problem presents
   a major challenge in the real world of plan recognition. Users often
   pursue several goals in a concurrent and interleaving manner, where the
   pursuit of goals may spread over different parts of an activity sequence
   and may be pursued in parallel. Existing approaches for multigoal
   problems are probabilistic approaches. They all assume the existence of
   plan libraries, which require a lot of human efforts in predicting and
   formalizing plans and may be impractical in many cases. In this paper,
   we present a novel logic-based approach to solve the multigoal
   recognition problem efficiently, without the need of plan libraries,
   using a state-of-the-art heuristic search planner LAMA. In particular,
   we first propose the formulation of a multigoal recognition problem
   based on automated planning. Then we present a bilevel probabilistic
   plan recognition approach that deals with both concurrent and
   interleaving goals from observed activity sequences. Experimental
   results over several domains show that our method has great flexibility
   and scalability.}},

   by taking advantage of the synergies between human computation and
   mechanical computation. We call this a human/computer learning network,
   whose core is an active learning feedback loop between humans and
   machines that dramatically improves the quality of both and thereby
   continually improves the effectiveness of the network as a whole. In
   this article we explore how human/computer learning networks can
   leverage the contributions of human observers and process their
   contributed data with artificial intelligence algorithms leading to a
   computational power that far exceeds the sum of the individual parts.}},

Abstract = {{Finding the universal artificial intelligent agent is the old dream of
   AI scientists. Solomonoff Induction was one big step towards this,
   giving a universal solution to the general problem of sequence
   prediction by defining a universal prior distribution. Hutter defined
   the AIXI model, which extends the latter to the reinforcement learning
   framework, where almost all if not all AI problems can be formulated.
   However, new difficulties arise because the agent is now active, whereas
   it is only passive in the sequence prediction case. This makes proving
   AIXI's optimality difficult. In fact, we prove that the current
   definition of AIXI can sometimes be suboptimal in a certain sense, but
   that this behavior is still the most rational one, hence emphasizing the
   difficulty of universal reinforcement learning. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new methodology based on the use of Multi-Agent
   Based Simulations (MABS) for testing and validation of Ambient
   Intelligence based Ubiquitous Computing (UbiCom) systems. An ambient
   intelligence based UbiCom is a pervasive system in which services have
   some intelligence in order to smoothly interact with users immersed in
   the environment. The motivation for this methodology is its application
   in UbiCom large-scale systems where large numbers of users are involved
   and in applications which deal with dangerous environments. In these
   cases, real tests are impractical and an artificial society is required.
   MABS allows building cheap and quick prototypes which can describe
   UbiCom systems. Analyzing these prototypes, if they are sufficiently
   descriptive, allows requisites violations in functionality of real
   UbiCom system designs to be discovered. MABSs and particularly the most
   descriptive ones can present very complex behaviors. Therefore, the MABS
   analysis obtained with the presented methodology is not trivial.
   Consequently, this paper also proposes two techniques for the analysis
   of general complex MABSs: forensic analysis and the use of simpler
   simulations. Moreover, the methodology proposes to inject elements of
   the actual UbiCom system in the simulated world to increase the
   confidence of the validation process. The proposal is illustrated with a
   detailed case study that considers a building on our campus and an AmI
   service for evacuation in case of fire. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Application of learning pallets for real-time scheduling by the use of
   radial basis function network}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{82-93}},

Abstract = {{The expansion of the scope and scale of products in the current business
   environments causes a continuous increase in complexity of logistics
   activities. In order to deal with this challenge in planning and control
   of logistics activities, several solutions have been introduced. One of
   the most latest one is the application of autonomy. The paradigm of
   autonomy in inbound logistics, can be reflected in decisions for
   real-time scheduling and control of material flows. Integration of
   autonomous control with material carrier objects can realize the
   expected advantages of this alternative into shop-floors. Since pallets
   (bins, fixtures, etc.) are some common used carrier objects in
   logistics, they have the potential to undertake the responsibility of
   real-time jobs dispatching to machines in the shop-floor scheduling
   problem. Hence, the current paper covers the problem of real-time
   scheduling in a stochastic and complex shop-floor environment, by means
   of autonomy. Indeed, the sustainment's advantage of pallets in
   manufacturing systems has inspired the idea of developing learning
   pallets (Lpallets) with the capability of autonomous control in complex
   and uncertain logistics environment with abrupt changes. Among some
   intelligent techniques, the artificial neural network (ANN) and,
   specially, the radial basis function network (RBFN) is selected to
   transmit the abilities of intelligent decision-making as well as
   learning to Lpallets in a distributed manner. Some variants in training
   and RBFN application alternatives are considered to evaluate the
   competency of RBFN for Lpallets. An Lpallet makes its dispatching and
   control decision based on its own experience and intelligence about the
   entire system and local situations in an exemplary hybrid flow-open shop
   problem. To prove the claimed application of RBFN in autonomous Lpallets
   a discrete-event simulation model is developed for the assembly
   scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a general kind of flow shop scheduling problem in a
   manufacturing supply chain where a group of jobs can be processed on a
   machine simultaneously. Examples of such environment occur in chemical
   processes, semiconductor industries, electronics manufacturing, wafer
   fabrication, and pharmaceutical industries, etc. In this problem not
   only should the sequence of jobs be determined but also the formation of
   batches is considered as a new variable in the model. The problem under
   investigation is NP-hard for cost of total earliness; total tardiness
   and makespan as objectives. During recent years, the nature-inspired
   computational intelligent algorithms are successfully employed for
   achieving the optimum design of supply chain structures. Hence, three
   effective computational intelligence algorithms including a hybrid
   genetic algorithm (HGA), a hybrid simulated annealing (HSA) and an
   improved discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are
   developed and analyzed for solving the batch processing machine
   scheduling problem addressed in current paper. Furthermore, an adaptive
   learning approach which is inspired by the training weights in
   artificial neural network (ANN) environment is embedded into the
   algorithms so as to enhance the quality of solutions. An extensive
   simulation experiments is conducted and the performance of algorithms is
   compared with the traditional genetic algorithm, particle swarm
   optimization, some well known dispatching rules such as STPT, LTPT,
   SBMPT, LBMPT, EDD, MST and also with the powerful commercial solver
   LINGO. The attained results show the appropriate performance of our

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{385-393}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a simple extension of the celebrated MINIMAX
   algorithm used in zero-sum two-player games, called Rminimax. The
   Rminimax algorithm allows controlling the strength of an artificial
   rival by randomizing its strategy in an optimal way. In particular, the
   randomized shortest-path framework is applied for biasing the artificial
   intelligence (AI) adversary toward worse or better solutions, therefore
   controlling its strength. In other words, our model aims at
   introducing/implementing bounded rationality to the MINIMAX algorithm.
   This framework takes into account all possible strategies by computing
   an optimal tradeoff between exploration (quantified by the entropy
   spread in the tree) and exploitation (quantified by the expected cost to
   an end game) of the game tree. As opposed to other tree-exploration
   techniques, this new algorithm considers complete paths of a tree
   (strategies) where a given entropy is spread. The optimal randomized
   strategy is efficiently computed by means of a simple recurrence
   relation while keeping the same complexity as the original MINIMAX. As a
   result, the Rminimax implements a nondeterministic strength-adapted AI
   opponent for board games in a principled way, thus avoiding the
   assumption of complete rationality. Simulations on two common games show
   that Rminimax behaves as expected.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall-runoff process was modeled for a small catchment in Turkey,

Abstract = {{Accurate heat rate forecasting is very important in ensuring the
   economic, efficient, and safe operation of a steam turbine unit. The
   support vector machine (SVM) is a novel tool from the artificial
   intelligence field that has been successfully applied to heat rate
   forecasting. The least squares SVM (LS-SVM) is an improved algorithm
   based on the SVM. LS-SVM has minimal computational complexity and fast
   calculation. However, traditional LS-SVM, which was established by using
   offline data samples, can no longer accurately describe the actual
   system working condition, thereby resulting in problems when directly
   used in heat rate prediction. In this paper, a heat rate forecasting
   method based on online LS-SVM, which possesses dynamic prediction
   functions, is proposed. To avoid blindness and inaccuracy in parameter
   selection, the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is used to optimize
   the regularization parameter gamma and the kernel parameter sigma(2) of
   the online LS-SVM modeling. The results confirm the efficiency of the
   proposed method. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Welfare analysis is a very important issue in the context of

   exist many conventional techniques and traditional methods that are used

   a community is to identify factors affecting welfare. For the first
   time, Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) which is a
   powerful artificial intelligence tool is used as a new approach in
   economic welfare. To do this, real micro-data including some
   characteristics of households and housing units were used. We identified
   the most important factors affecting household welfare applying the
   ANFIS method. The ANFIS was then parameterized using these factors in
   order to predict the welfare measure. The empirical results showed that
   the ANFIS method outperforms the multiple regression method. (c) 2012

Title = {{A Cooperative Ant Colony Optimization-Genetic Algorithm approach for

Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{194-206}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge-based expert systems are becoming one of the major tools for
   scientists and engineers nowadays, since they have many attractive
   features and can be called upon to deal with real/complex engineering
   application problems which are not easy to solve by orthodox methods.
   Meanwhile, increasing worldwide demand for different types of energy
   requires development of advanced intelligent forecasting tools to
   provide a basis from which decisions and plans can be made. This study
   presents a new approach called ``Cooperative Ant Colony
   Optimization-Genetic Algorithm{''} (COR-ACO-GA), to construct expert
   systems with the ability to model and simulate fluctuations of energy
   demand under the influence of related factors. The proposed approach has
   two main stages, at the first stage it uses genetic algorithms to
   generate data base of the expert system, and at the second stage it
   adopts ant colony optimization to learn linguistic fuzzy rules such that
   degree of cooperation between data base and rule base increases and
   consequently performance of the algorithm improves. We evaluate
   capability of COR-ACO-GA by applying it on three case studies of annual
   electricity demand, natural gas demand and oil products demand in Iran.
   Results indicate that COR-ACO-GA provides more accurate-stable results
   than adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs) and artificial
   neural networks (ANNs), and can assist decision makers in making
   appropriate decisions and plans for a coming period. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Image deblurring is indispensable to many image processing applications.
   In this paper, we try to improve radiological images degraded during
   acquisition and processing. An autoregressive moving average (ARMA)
   model, used for nonlinearly degraded image deconvolution, is identified
   using a neural network (NN). The NN training is improved using a novel
   swarm optimization algorithm called Artificial Bees Colony (ABC),
   inspired from the foraging intelligence of honey bees. The ABC has the
   advantage of employing fewer control parameters compared to other swarm
   optimization algorithms. Both estimated image and blur function are
   identified through this representation. The optimized ARMA-NN model is
   then implemented on a Xilinx reconfigurable field-programmable gate
   array (FPGA) using hardware description language: VHDL. This VHDL code
   is tested on the rapid prototyping platform named ML505 based on a
   Virtex5-LXT FPGA chip of Xilinx. Simulation results using some test and
   real images are presented to sustain the applicability of this approach
   compared to the standard blind image deconvolution (BID) method that
   maximizes the likelihood using an iterative process. A statistical
   comparison is concluded based on performance evaluation using seven
   recent image quality metrics. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel controller design method based on using
   artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms for an unstable nonlinear
   continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) chemical system. Such CSTR
   process is highly nonlinear and its dynamic is significantly dominated
   by system parameters. It is a good challenge to access the controller
   design performance when the controller is applied in the CSTR control
   system. The commonly used proportional-integral-derivative (PID)
   controller is taken into account in this study, and tuning three PID
   control gains is carried out by the artificial bee colony algorithm.
   With the use of the optimal ABC algorithm, PID controller gains can be
   derived suitably by means of minimizing the cost function given in
   advance. Finally, several control operations are provided to confirm the
   feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. We also discuss
   the influence of algorithm initial conditions on the control performance

   random excitation forces. The resulting simulations are presented and

Title = {{Prediction analysis of a wastewater treatment system using a Bayesian
   network}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Wastewater treatment is a complicated dynamic process, the effectiveness
   of which is affected by microbial, chemical, and physical factors. At
   present, predicting the effluent quality of wastewater treatment systems
   is difficult because of complex biological reaction mechanisms that vary
   with both time and the physical attributes of the system. Bayesian
   networks are useful for addressing uncertainties in artificial
   intelligence applications. Their powerful inferential capability and
   convenient decision support mechanisms provide flexibility and
   applicability for describing and analyzing factors affecting wastewater
   treatment systems. In this study, a Bayesian network-based approach for
   modeling and predicting a wastewater treatment system based on Modified
   Sequencing Batch Reactor (MSBR) was proposed. Using the presented
   approach, a Bayesian network model for MSBR can be constructed using
   experiential information and physical data relating to influent loads,
   operating conditions, and effluent concentrations. Additionally, MSBR
   prediction analysis, wherein effluent concentration can be predicted
   from influent loads and operational conditions, can be performed. This
   approach can be applied, with minimal modifications, to other types of
   wastewater treatment plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{453-482}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The incidence and the prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in
   Taiwan are the highest in the world. Therefore, hemodialysis (HD)
   therapy is a major concern and an important challenge due to the
   shortage of donated organs for transplantation. Previous researchers
   developed various forecasting models based on statistical methods and
   artificial intelligence techniques to address the real-world problems of
   HD therapy that are faced by ESRD patients and their doctors in the
   healthcare services. Because the performance of these forecasting models
   is highly dependent on the context and the data used, it would be
   valuable to develop more suitable methods for applications in this
   field. This study presents an integrated procedure that is based on
   rough set classifiers and aims to provide an alternate method for
   predicting the urea reduction ratio for assessing HD adequacy for ESRD
   patients and their doctors. The proposed procedure is illustrated in
   practice by examining a dataset from a specific medical center in
   Taiwan. The experimental results reveal that the proposed procedure has
   better accuracy with a low standard deviation than the listed methods.
   The output created by the rough set LEM2 algorithm is a comprehensible
   decision rule set that can be applied in knowledge-based healthcare
   services as desired. The analytical results provide useful information
   for both academics and practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{Configuration of large-scale applications in an engineering context
   requires a modeling environment that allows the design engineer to draft
   the configuration problem in a natural way and efficient methods that
   can process the modeled setting and scale with the number of components.
   Existing configuration methods in artificial intelligence typically
   perform quite well in certain subareas but are hard to use for
   general-purpose modeling without mathematical or logics background (the
   so-called knowledge acquisition bottleneck) and/or have scalability
   issues. As a remedy to this important issue both in theory and in
   practical applications, we use a standard modeling environment like the
   Unified Modeling Language that has been proposed by the configuration
   community as a suitable object-oriented formalism for configuration
   problems. We provide a translation of key concepts of class diagrams to
   inequalities and identify relevant configuration aspects and show how
   they are treated as an integer linear program. Solving an integer linear
   program can be done efficiently, and integer linear programming scales
   well to large configurations consisting of several thousands components
   and interactions. We conduct an empirical study in the context of
   package management for operating systems and for the Linux kernel
   configuration. We evaluate our methodology by a benchmark and obtain
   convincing results in support for using integer linear programming for
   configuration applications of realistic size and complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge representation (KR) is an important area in artificial
   intelligence (AI) and is often related to specific domains. The
   representation of knowledge in domain-specific contexts makes it
   desirable to capture semantics as domain experts would. This motivates
   the development of semantics-preserving standards for KR within the
   given domain. In addition to the storage and analysis of information
   using such standards, the effect of globalization today necessitates the
   publishing of information on the Web. Thus, it is advisable to use
   formats that make the information easily publishable and accessible
   while developing KR standards. In this article, we propose such a
   standard called Quenching Markup Language (QuenchML). This follows the
   syntax of the eXtensible Markup Language and captures the semantics of
   the quenching domain within the heat treating of materials. We describe
   the development of QuenchML, a multidisciplinary effort spanning the
   realms of AI, database management, and materials science, considering
   various aspects such as ontology, data modeling, and domain-specific
   constraints. We also explain the usefulness of QuenchML in
   semantics-preserving information retrieval and in text mining guided by
   domain knowledge. Furthermore, we outline the significance of this work
   in software tools within the field of AI.}},

Abstract = {{In natural language processing (NIP), disambiguation is the procedure

   noun and as a preposition. Work herein reported describes an algorithm
   and its implementation to disambiguate prepositions in Spanish phrases;
   some of them are: a (to) (Translation to English are in bold for

   con (with), hacia (towards), sobre (about), hasta (until), de (of), tras

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{231-273}},
Abstract = {{TRIZ (the Russian acronym for Theory of Resolution of Inventive
   Problems) is a methodology to guide the search for inventive solutions
   to one, or a few, difficult problems. Classic TRIZ is not well suited to
   the examination of complex situations composed of many problems,
   sub-problems and partial solutions, strongly interconnected. It has
   therefore been completed to give birth, among others, to the Inventive
   Design Methodology (IDM) framework.
   TRIZ and IDM share many similarities with Artificial Intelligence
   methods: they both propose to solve a problem by reformulation in an
   abstract model. Generic solving patterns are applied to this abstract
   model to produce abstract solutions. The domain-specific knowledpge is
   then used to get the final solution concept. However, neither TRIZ nor
   IDM's descriptions are formal enough to permit a reliable software
   implementation and rely mainly on the experts' manual work. Therefore
   this paper proposes an ontological formalization of TRIZ and IDM to
   overcome these difficulties and allow the development of software tools
   to assist TRIZ/IDM experts in their work.}},

Abstract = {{Usually a dataset has a lot of reducts finding all of which is known to
   be an NP hard problem. On the other hand, different reducts of a dataset
   may provide different classification accuracies. Usually, for every
   dataset, there is only a reduct with the best classification accuracy to
   obtain this best one, firstly we obtain the group of attributes that are
   dominant for the given dataset by using the decision tree algorithm.
   Secondly we complete this group up to reducts by using discernibility
   function techniques. Finally, we select only one reduct with the best
   classification accuracy by using data mining classification algorithms.
   The experimental results for datasets indicate that the classification
   accuracy is improved by removing the irrelevant features and using the
   simplified attribute set which is derived from proposed method.}},

Title = {{Self-Aware Trader: A New Approach to Safer Trading}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{2292-2319}},
Abstract = {{Traders are required to work in the financial market with highly complex
   information and to perform efficiently under high levels of
   psychological pressure. Multiple disciplines, from programs with
   artificial intelligence to complex mathematical functions, are used to
   help traders in their effort to maximize profits. However, an essential
   problem not yet considered in this rapidly evolving environment is that
   traders are not supported to adequately manage how stress influences
   their decisions. This paper takes into consideration the negative
   influences of stress on individuals and proposes a system designed to
   support traders by providing them with information that can reduce the
   likelihood of poor decision-making. The system has been designed
   considering both technical and physiological aspects to make information
   available in a suitable way. Biometric sensors are used to collect data
   associated with stress, a software platform then analyses this
   information and displays it to the trader. The resulting system is
   capable of making individual traders, as well as teams of traders,
   self-aware of their levels of stress. The system has been tested in real
   environments and the results provide evidence that self-aware traders
   benefit from the system by reducing risky decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Argumentation frameworks for ontology reasoning and management have
   received extensive interests in the field of artificial intelligence in
   recent years. As one of the most popular argumentation frameworks,
   Besnard and Hunter's framework is built on arguments in the form of
   <Phi, phi > where Phi is consistent and minimal for entailing phi.
   However, the problem of generating arguments over ontologies is still
   open. This paper presents an approach to generating arguments over
   DL-Lite ontologies by searching support paths in focal graphs. Moreover,
   theoretical results and examples are provided to ensure the correctness
   of this approach. Finally, we show that approach has the same complexity

Title = {{A Hybrid Fuzzy Time Series Approach Based on Fuzzy Clustering and
   Artificial Neural Network with Single Multiplicative Neuron Model}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Particularly in recent years, artificial intelligence optimization
   techniques have been used to make fuzzy time series approaches more
   systematic and improve forecasting performance. Besides, some fuzzy
   clustering methods and artificial neural networks with different
   structures are used in the fuzzification of observations and
   determination of fuzzy relationships, respectively. In approaches
   considering the membership values, the membership values are determined
   subjectively or fuzzy outputs of the system are obtained by considering
   that there is a relation between membership values in identification of
   relation. This necessitates defuzzification step and increases the model
   error. In this study, membership values were obtained more
   systematically by using Gustafson-Kessel fuzzy clustering technique. The
   use of artificial neural network with single multiplicative neuron model
   in identification of fuzzy relation eliminated the architecture
   selection problem as well as the necessity for defuzzification step by
   constituting target values from real observations of time series. The
   training of artificial neural network with single multiplicative neuron
   model which is used for identification of fuzzy relation step is carried
   out with particle swarm optimization. The proposed method is implemented
   using various time series and the results are compared with those of
   previous studies to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{We are currently experiencing a boom in the presence of Spanish language

   creation of an integrated Massively Multiuser Online Learning (MMOL)
   platform that enables the creation, development and deployment of
   contents and activities for teaching Spanish in an ad hoc educational
   virtual world named SLRoute. Such environment promotes an immersive,

Abstract = {{Setting of relay coordination in a looped power network is highly
   non-linear bounded, constrained optimisation problem. Complexity of
   problem increases as the size of system increases. Recently artificial
   intelligence-based optimisation techniques are applied successfully for
   protection application in power system. Traditionally protection relays
   are electro-mechanically with discrete time dial and plug setting.
   Optimisation of relay coordination problem considering the discrete
   relay parameters needs the optimisation algorithm which can handle the
   discrete value of decision variables. In this paper, application of
   artificial bee colony algorithm is extended for discrete optimal
   coordination of overcurrent relays. Moreover, relay coordination problem
   is modified to optimise the relay setting for both near and far end
   faults.}},

Title = {{Horn Clause Contraction Function}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{475-511}},
Abstract = {{In classical, AGM-style belief change, it is assumed that the underlying
   logic contains classical propositional logic. This is clearly a limiting
   assumption, particularly in Artificial Intelligence. Consequently there
   has been recent interest in studying belief change in approaches where
   the full expressivity of classical propositional logic is not obtained.
   In this paper we investigate belief contraction in Horn knowledge bases.
   We point out that the obvious extension to the Horn case, involving Horn
   remainder sets as a starting point, is problematic. Not only do Horn
   remainder sets have undesirable properties, but also some desirable Horn
   contraction functions are not captured by this approach. For Horn belief
   set contraction, we develop an account in terms of a model-theoretic
   characterisation involving weak remainder sets. Maxichoice and partial
   meet Horn contraction is specified, and we show that the problems
   arising with earlier work are resolved by these approaches. As well,
   constructions of the specific operators and sets of postulates are
   provided, and representation results are obtained. We also examine Horn
   package contraction, or contraction by a set of formulas. Again, we give
   a construction and postulate set, linking them via a representation
   result. Last, we investigate the closely-related notion of forgetting in
   Horn clauses. This work is arguably interesting since Horn clauses have
   found widespread use in AI; as well, the results given here may
   potentially be extended to other areas which make use of Horn-like
   reasoning, such as logic programming, rule-based systems, and
   description logics. Finally, since Horn reasoning is weaker than
   classical reasoning, this work sheds light on the foundations of belief
   change.}},

Title = {{Accurate Multisteps Traffic Flow Prediction Based on SVM}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Accurate traffic flow prediction is prerequisite and important for
   realizing intelligent traffic control and guidance, and it is also the
   objective requirement for intelligent traffic management. Due to the
   strong nonlinear, stochastic, time-varying characteristics of urban
   transport system, artificial intelligence methods such as support vector
   machine (SVM) are now receiving more and more attentions in this
   research field. Compared with the traditional single-step prediction
   method, the multisteps prediction has the ability that can predict the
   traffic state trends over a certain period in the future. From the
   perspective of dynamic decision, it is far important than the current
   traffic condition obtained. Thus, in this paper, an accurate multi-steps
   traffic flow prediction model based on SVM was proposed. In which, the
   input vectors were comprised of actual traffic volume and four different
   types of input vectors were compared to verify their prediction
   performance with each other. Finally, the model was verified with actual
   data in the empirical analysis phase and the test results showed that
   the proposed SVM model had a good ability for traffic flow prediction
   and the SVM-HPT model outperformed the other three models for
   prediction.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{2307-2328}},
Abstract = {{The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, which was inspired by the
   foraging and dance behaviors of real honey bee colonies, was first
   introduced for solving numerical optimization problems. When the
   solution space of the optimization problem is binary-structured, the
   basic ABC algorithm should be modified for solving this class of
   problems. In this study, we propose XOR-based modification for the
   solution-updating equation of the ABC algorithm in order to solve binary
   optimization problems. The proposed method, named binary ABC (binABC),
   is examined on an uncapacitated facility location problem, which is a
   pure binary optimization problem, and the results obtained by the binABC
   are compared with results obtained by binary particle swarm optimization
   (BPSO), the discrete ABC (DisABC) algorithm, and improved BPSO (IBPSO).
   The experimental results show that binABC is an alternative tool for
   solving binary optimization problems and is a competitive algorithm when
   compared with BPSO, DisABC, and IBPSO in terms of solution quality,
   robustness, and simplicity.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women all

   the proposed hybrid model and the success rate of the RS + ELM model was
   determined as 100\%. Moreover, the most appropriate attributes for the

   Algorithm}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{464-486}},
Abstract = {{Tight-frame, a generalization of orthogonal wavelets, has been used
   successfully in various problems in image processing, including
   inpainting, impulse noise removal, and superresolution image
   restoration. Segmentation is the process of identifying object outlines
   within images. There are quite a few efficient algorithms for
   segmentation such as model-based approaches, pattern recognition
   techniques, tracking-based approaches, and artificial intelligence-based
   approaches. In this paper, we propose applying the tight-frame approach
   to automatically identify tube-like structures in medical imaging, with
   the primary application of segmenting blood vessels in magnetic
   resonance angiography images. Our method iteratively refines a region
   that encloses the potential boundary of the vessels. At each iteration,
   we apply the tight-frame algorithm to denoise and smooth the potential
   boundary and sharpen the region. The cost per iteration is proportional
   to the number of pixels in the image. We prove that the iteration
   converges in a finite number of steps to a binary image whereby the
   segmentation of the vessels can be done straightforwardly. Numerical
   experiments on synthetic and real two-dimensional (2D) and
   three-dimensional (3D) images demonstrate that our method is more
   accurate when compared with some representative segmentation methods,
   and it usually converges within a few iterations.}},

Title = {{Combining approaches for solving satisfiability problems with
   qualitative preferences}},
Journal = {{AI COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{395-408}},
Abstract = {{The ability to effectively reason in the presence of qualitative
   preferences on literals or formulas is a central issue in Artificial
   Intelligence. In the last few years, two procedures have been presented
   in order to reason with propositional satisfiability (SAT) problems in
   the presence of additional, partially ordered qualitative preferences on
   literals or formulas: the first requires a modification of the branching
   heuristic of the SAT solver in order to guarantee that the first
   solution is optimal, while the second computes a sequence of solutions,
   each guaranteed to be better than the previous one. The two approaches
   have their own advantages and disadvantages and when compared on
   specific classes of instances - each having an empty partial order - the
   second seems to have superior performance.
   In this paper we show that the above two approaches for reasoning with
   qualitative preferences can be combined yielding a new effective
   procedure. In particular, in the new procedure we modify the branching
   heuristic - as in the first approach - by possibly changing the polarity
   of the returned literal, and then we continue the search - as in the
   second approach - looking for better solutions. We extended the
   experimental analysis conducted in previous papers by considering a wide
   variety of problems, having both an empty and a non-empty partial order:
   the results show that the new procedure performs better than the two
   previous approaches on average, and especially on the ``hard{''}
   problems. As a preliminary result, we show that the framework of
   qualitative preferences on literals is more general and expressive than
   the framework on quantitative preferences.}},

Title = {{Multiattribute Decision Making Based on Entropy under Interval-Valued
   Intuitionistic Fuzzy Environment}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Multiattribute decision making (MADM) is one of the central problems in
   artificial intelligence, specifically in management fields. In most
   cases, this problem arises from uncertainty both in the data derived
   from the decision maker and the actions performed in the environment.
   Fuzzy set and high-order fuzzy sets were proven to be effective
   approaches in solving decision-making problems with uncertainty.
   Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the MADM problem with
   completely unknown attribute weights in the framework of interval-valued
   intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) set (IVIFS). We first propose a new
   definition of IVIF entropy and some calculation methods for IVIF
   entropy. Furthermore, we propose an entropy-based decision making method
   to solve IVIF MADM problems with completely unknown attribute weights.
   Particular emphasis is put on assessing the attribute weights based on
   IVIF entropy. Instead of the traditional methods, which use divergence
   among attributes or the probabilistic discrimination of attributes to
   obtain attribute weights, we utilize the IVIF entropy to assess the
   attribute weights based on the credibility of the decision-making matrix
   for solving the problem. Finally, a supplier selection example is given
   to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed MADM method.}},

Title = {{Simultaneous-Fault Diagnosis of Gas Turbine Generator Systems Using a
   Pairwise-Coupled Probabilistic Classifier}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{A reliable fault diagnostic system for gas turbine generator system
   (GTGS), which is complicated and inherent with many types of component
   faults, is essential to avoid the interruption of electricity supply.
   However, the GTGS diagnosis faces challenges in terms of the existence
   of simultaneous-fault diagnosis and high cost in acquiring the
   exponentially increased simultaneous-fault vibration signals for
   constructing the diagnostic system. This research proposes a new
   diagnostic framework combining feature extraction, pairwise-coupled
   probabilistic classifier, and decision threshold optimization. The
   feature extraction module adopts wavelet packet transform and
   time-domain statistical features to extract vibration signal features.
   Kernel principal component analysis is then applied to further reduce
   the redundant features. The features of single faults in a
   simultaneous-fault pattern are extracted and then detected using a
   probabilistic classifier, namely, pairwise-coupled relevance vector
   machine, which is trained with single-fault patterns only. Therefore,
   the training dataset of simultaneous-fault patterns is unnecessary. To
   optimize the decision threshold, this research proposes to use grid
   search method which can ensure a global solution as compared with
   traditional computational intelligence techniques. Experimental results
   show that the proposed framework performs well for both single-fault and
   simultaneous-fault diagnosis and is superior to the frameworks without
   feature extraction and pairwise coupling.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{1495-1503}},
Abstract = {{About one million women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year.
   Breast cancer makes up one-third of all cancer diagnoses in women.
   Diagnosing breast cancer early is vital for successful treatment. Among
   the breast cancer screening methods available today, mammography is the
   most effective, although the low precision rate of breast biopsy caused
   by mammogram interpretation results in approximately 70\% unnecessary
   biopsies with benign outcomes.
   The aim of this study was to extract strong diagnostic fuzzy rules for
   the inference engine of an expert system to be used for the diagnosis of
   breast cancer. These rules have been extracted through the use of
   artificial intelligence technologies. For this, a neuro-fuzzy
   classification tool called NEFCLASS was used. The learning algorithm of
   this tool is heuristic and it has efficient performance diagnosis and
   classification tasks. The rule base to be used for diagnosis consists of
   9 rules using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS),
   mass shape, and mass margin attributes. The positive predictive value of
   this rule base is 75\% and the negative predictive value is 93\%. When
   the approximately 70\% rate of unnecessary biopsy in the diagnosis
   process is taken into consideration, an expert system that has this
   strong rule base with a high predictive value can be used by doctors in
   deciding whether to conduct biopsies.}},

Title = {{3D vision based quality inspection with computational intelligence}},
Journal = {{ASSEMBLY AUTOMATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{240-246}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Product quality inspection is of importance in manufacturing
   industries to ensure that low quality or unqualified products are not
   delivered to the consumer. Human inspection has many limitations such as
   low accuracy or speed due to factors such as tiredness and boredom.
   Traditional 2D vision inspection also has limitations of product shape
   complexity or flexibility. Thus, automated 3D vision inspection is
   anticipated to meet the requirements of higher applicability. This paper
   seeks to address these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - In many product quality inspection
   problems, geometrical parameters of the industrial parts are commonly
   used as the basis of quality inspection. Machine vision is widely
   applied to acquire such kind of parameters. Comparing to traditional 2D
   vision, 3D vision can acquire 3D coordinates of the object directly, so
   that the inspection can be accomplished which is difficult to do with 2D
   vision. As an active vision technique, structure light system (SLS) is
   applied to acquire the 3D coordinate information of inspected object in
   this paper. On the basis of point cloud and regression analysis,
   features relative to quality are defined and extracted as the attributes
   for the product classification. Three data mining techniques are applied
   to accomplish the classification in this paper, which include decision
   trees, artificial neural networks and support vector machine.
   Findings - A new intelligent automated 3D vision quality inspection for
   assembly lines has been developed, which comprises structure light
   system (SLS) and data mining approaches such as decision tree,
   artificial neutral networks and support vector machine.
   Originality/value - The combination of structure light system (SLS) and
   data mining approaches makes the automated quality inspection available.
   The proposed system is easy to be implemented and flexible for different
   types of products.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer is the leading life-threatening disease for people in today's
   world. Although cancer formation is different for each type of cancer,
   it has been determined by studies and research that stress also triggers
   cancer types. Early precaution is very important for people who have not
   fallen ill yet with a disease like cancer that has a high mortality rate
   and expensive treatment. With this study, we expound that the
   possibility of developing such disease may be decreased and people could
   take measures against it. For the 3 cancer types selected as pilot work
   by introducing a fuzzy logic model, the risks for acquiring these cancer
   types and preliminary diagnosis for the person to remove these risks are
   presented. After calculating the risk outcome, the effect of stress on
   cancer is discussed and determined. Within the study, a fuzzy logic
   technique that can easily be adapted to other industry studies, as well,
   is applied to the health industry and effective software for application
   is developed. Due to this type of study, people will have the chance to
   take measures against developing cancer and the rate of suffering from
   cancer may be decreased. Furthermore, the performance status of the new
   technique is revealed by calculating performance measurements by the
   outcomes of the models developed by the new type of fuzzy logic
   technique for 3 cancer types selected as a pilot in the Mamdani type of
   fuzzy logic model.}},

Pages = {{113-120}},
Abstract = {{The evolution of the computer aided design and control technologies in
   the field of static power converters leads also to diagnosis systems
   which include modules based on artificial intelligence. In order to
   achieve satisfactory reliability, the static power converters must even
   be assembled by using high reliability devices and/or be conceived as
   redundant topologies.
   The paper presents a dedicated monitoring and diagnosis system of the
   static power converters. It can be used both for the diagnosis of the
   transistors within an inverter as well as for the analysis and diagnosis
   of a power bridge rectifier.
   The diagnosis system dedicated to the power rectifiers uses the fault
   tree method. Based on the symptoms observed in the behavior of the power
   rectifiers, the diagnosis and the functional test performed by the
   developed system is based on consideration of the abnormal comportments
   and the faults which determine these. The experimental system dedicated
   to the bridge rectifiers analyses and identifies the causes of the
   faults which occur during the operation and reduces the displayed
   results if two sets of values of the sources which determine the same
   answer, differ by a single input.}},

   in water distribution systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{634-651}},
Abstract = {{This paper focusses on the customisation and further enhancement of the
   recently developed data-driven methodology for the automated near
   real-time detection of pipe bursts and other (e.g. sensor faults) events
   at the district metered area (DMA) level. Assuming the availability of
   pressure/flow data from an increased number of sensors deployed in a
   DMA, the aim is to: (i) overcome the limitations of the probabilistic
   inference engine when dealing with the increased data availability; and
   (ii) exploit the event information resulting from the analysis of the
   larger number of DMA signals for determining the approximate location of
   the pipe burst events within the DMA. This is achieved by making use of
   a multivariate Gaussian mixtures-based graphical model and
   geostatistical techniques. The novel detection and location methodology
   is demonstrated and tested on a series of simulated pipe burst events
   that were performed by opening hydrants in a real-life DMA in the UK.
   The results obtained illustrate that the new methodology can
   successfully determine the approximate location of pipe bursts within a
   DMA (in addition to detecting them in a fast and reliable manner). The
   performance comparison of several geostatistical techniques shows that
   the Ordinary Cokriging technique outperforms all other techniques
   tested.}},

Abstract = {{The Matrix Bandwidth Minimization Problem (MBMP) seeks for a
   simultaneous reordering of the rows and the columns of a square matrix
   such that the nonzero entries are collected within a band of small width
   close to the main diagonal. The MBMP is a NP-complete problem, with
   applications in many scientific domains, linear systems, artificial
   intelligence, and real-life situations in industry, logistics,
   information recovery. The complex problems are hard to solve, that is
   why any attempt to improve their solutions is beneficent. Genetic
   algorithms and ant-based systems are Soft Computing methods used in this
   paper in order to solve some MBMP instances. Our approach is based on a
   learning agent-based model involving a local search procedure. The
   algorithm is compared with the classical Cuthill-McKee algorithm, and
   with a hybrid genetic algorithm, using several instances from Matrix
   Market collection. Computational experiments confirm a good performance
   of the proposed algorithms for the considered set of MBMP instances. On
   Soft Computing basis, we also propose a new theoretical Reinforcement
   Learning model for solving the MBMP.}},

Abstract = {{Time plays an important role in the vast majority of problems and, as
   such, it is a vital issue to be considered when developing computer
   systems for solving problems. In the literature, one of the most
   influential formalisms for representing time is known as Allen's
   Temporal Algebra based on a set of 13 relations (basic and reversed)
   that may hold between two time intervals. In spite of having a few
   drawbacks and limitations, Allen's formalism is still a convenient
   representation due to its simplicity and implementability and also, due
   to the fact that it has been the basis of several extensions. This paper
   explores the automatic learning of Allen's temporal relations by the
   inductive logic programming system FOIL, taking into account two
   possible representations for a time interval: (i) as a primitive concept
   and (ii) as a concept defined by the primitive concept of time point.
   The goals of the experiments described in the paper are (1) to explore
   the viability of both representations for use in automatic learning; (2)
   compare the facility and interpretability of the results; (3) evaluate
   the impact of the given examples for inducing a proper representation of
   the relations and (4) experiment with both representations under the
   assumption of a closed world (CWA), which would ease continuous learning
   using FOIL. Experimental results are presented and discussed as evidence
   that the CWA can be a convenient strategy when learning Allen's temporal
   relations.}},

   The authors of this article propose an effective clustering algorithm to
   exploit the features of neural networks, and especially Self Organizing
   Maps (SOM), for the reduction of data dimensionality. The issue of
   computational complexity is resolved by using a parallelization of the
   standard SOM algorithm. The authors have focused on the acceleration of
   the presented algorithm using a version suitable for data collections
   with a certain level of sparsity. Effective acceleration is achieved by
   improving the winning neuron finding phase and the weight actualization
   phase. The output presented here demonstrates sufficient acceleration of
   the standard SOM algorithm while preserving the appropriate accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{As an important artificial neural network, associative memory model can
   be employed to mimic human thinking and machine intelligence. In this
   paper, first, a multi-valued many-to-many Gaussian associative memory
   model (M(3)GAM) is proposed by introducing the Gaussian unidirectional
   associative memory model (GUAM) and Gaussian bidirectional associative
   memory model (GBAM) into Hattori et al's multi-module associative memory
   model ((MMA)(2)). Second, the M(3)GAM's asymptotical stability is proved
   theoretically in both synchronous and asynchronous update modes, which
   ensures that the stored patterns become the M(3)GAM's stable points.
   Third, by substituting the general similarity metric for the negative
   squared Euclidean distance in M(3)GAM, the generalized multivalued
   many-to-many Gaussian associative memory model (GM(3)GAM) is presented,
   which makes the M(3)GAM become its special case. Finally, we investigate
   the M(3)GAM's application in association-based image retrieval, and the
   computer simulation results verify the M(3)GAM's robust performance.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},

Abstract = {{An easy and efficient approach, based on artificial intelligence
   technique, is proposed to jointly estimate the amplitude, elevation, and
   azimuth angles of far field sources impinging on 2-L-shape array. In
   these proposed artificial intelligence techniques, the metaheuristics
   based on genetic algorithm and simulated annealing are used as global
   optimizers assisted with rapid local version of pattern search for
   optimization of the adaptive parameters. The performance metric is
   employed on a fitness evaluation function depending on mean square error
   which is optimum and requires single snapshot to converge. The proposed
   approaches are easy to understand, and simple to implement; the genetic
   algorithm specifically hybridized with pattern search generates fairly
   good results. The comparison of the given schemes is carried out with
   1-L-shape array, as well as, with parallel-shape array and is found to
   be in good agreement in terms of accuracy, convergence rate,
   computational complexity, and mean square error. The effectiveness and
   efficiency of the given schemes are examined through Monte Carlo
   simulations and their inclusive statistical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Swarm intelligence (SI) and artificial immune system (AIS) are both
   derived from imitation of nature biology system. Their common
   characteristic is that they both have simple individuals but appear
   emergence characteristic in population level through interaction among
   individuals. In order to explore inherent similarity and difference of
   complex system, we take two typical forms of swarm intelligence (ant
   colony system and particle swarm optimisation), and AIS as objectives to
   study this characteristic in this paper. First, we discuss the
   similarity between two biology systems from system structure and
   operation mechanism. In addition, we also illustrate the difference
   between two systems from algorithm design, individual diversity and
   shape space. At the end of the paper, numerical experiment is used to
   test the performance of swarm intelligence techniques and AIS, where
   benchmark test functions include unimodal and multimodal function
   optimisation problems. Besides, combined with a concrete example,
   travelling salesman problem (TSP), the generality and feature of these
   two systems in solving complex problems are discussed in detail. The
   objective of the paper is to set up inherent connection and difference
   between two unlike systems, which not only has important theoretical
   significance but also has significant actual value to reveal production

Abstract = {{Decision process can be summarized as a process that helps for choosing
   the optimal alternatives according to suggested objectives by evaluating

   process is considered in two person non-constant sum game theory
   perspective. The methods in literature about related topics (such as
   scenario planning and fuzzy TOPSIS) are examined and a hybrid decision
   making methodology that comprises many decision methods is formed. All
   phases of this approach are executed in game theory perspective by
   evaluating mutual strategies of players. In the study, the methodology
   is explained and a fictitious international disagreement case is used as

Abstract = {{We introduce a genetic algorithm-based topology control mechanism, named
   3D-GA, for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) operating in Underwater
   Sensor Networks (UWSNs). Using limited information collected from a
   node's local neighbours, 3D-GA runs autonomously at each AUV and
   provides guidance for its speed and direction towards a uniform spatial
   distribution while maintaining network connectivity. Imprecise and
   limited neighbourhood knowledge could potentially disrupt convergence
   towards a uniform and stable spatial coverage. We demonstrate that AUVs
   running our 3D-GA create a highly resilient network that can adapt to
   changing conditions such as the addition, loss or malfunction of number
   of AUVs. We also show that the ambiguity in detecting neighbours' exact
   locations does not prevent 3D-GA from achieving a uniform coverage but
   requiring AUVs travel longer distances to stabilise. Our simulation
   software results verify that 3D-GA is an effective tool for providing a
   robust solution for volumetric spatial control of AUVs in UWSNs.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Optimizing the final grinding production indices (GPIs), which include
   the product particle size and the grinding production rate, to meet the
   overall manufacturing performance requirements is the main function of
   automatic control of a grinding circuit (GC). However, the complex and
   time-varying nature of the GC process dictates that these GPIs cannot be
   optimized solely by the lower-level distributed control systems (DCS),
   therefore an operator is often incorporated to manually determine the
   set-points for the DCS using his/her operational experience. With a
   human being involved, the performance and even the safety and stability
   of the GC operation is subject to human errors. Focusing on this
   practical challenge, this paper proposes an intelligence-based
   supervisory control strategy that consists of a control loop set-point
   optimization module, an artificial neural network-based soft-sensor
   module, a fuzzy logic-based dynamic adjustor, and an expert-based
   overload diagnosis and adjustment module to perform the control tasks
   for the GC system. This hybrid system can automatically adjust the
   set-points for the DCS-controlled grinding system in response to the
   changes in boundary conditions or the imminent overload conditions,
   thereby eliminating the need for an operator. Practical applications
   have shown the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The sibling disciplines, systems and synthetic biology, are engaged in
   unraveling the complexity of the biological networks. One is trying to
   understand the design principle of the existing networks while the other
   is trying to engineer artificial gene networks with predicted functions.
   The significant and important role that computational intelligence can
   play to steer the life engineering discipline towards its ultimate goal,
   has been acknowledged since its time of birth. However, as the field is
   facing many challenges in building complex modules/systems from the
   simpler parts/devices, whether from scratch or through redesign, the
   role of computational assistance becomes even more crucial. Evolutionary
   computation, falling under the broader domain of artificial
   intelligence, is well-acknowledged for its near optimal solution seeking
   capability for poorly known and partially understood problems. Since the
   post genome period, these natural-selection simulating algorithms are
   playing a noteworthy role in identifying, analyzing and optimizing
   different types of biological networks. This article calls attention to
   how evolutionary computation can help synthetic biologists in assembling
   larger network systems from the lego-like parts.}},

Abstract = {{In order to obtain a computer-tractable model of music, we first discuss

   i.e., various attempts to represent our mental understandings and to
   show music structures. Among which, we especially pay attention to the
   Generative Theory of Tonal Music (GTTM) by Lehrdahl and Jackendoff, as
   the most promising candidate of cognitive/computational theory of music.
   We briefly overview the theory as well as its inherent problems,
   including the ambiguity of its preference rules. By our recent efforts,
   we have solved this ambiguity problem by assigning parametrized weights,
   and thus we could implement an automatic tree analyzer. After we
   introduce the system architecture, we show our application systems.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{427-445}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, artificial intelligence approaches such as artificial neural
   network (ANN) as a self-learn non-linear simulator and genetic
   programming (GP) as a tool for function approximations are widely used
   for rainfall-runoff modeling. Both approaches are usually created based
   on temporal characteristics of the process. Hence, the motivation to
   present a comprehensive model which also employs the watershed
   geomorphological features as spatial data. In this paper, two different
   scenarios, separated and integrated geomorphological GP (GGP) modeling
   based on observed time series and spatially varying geomorphological
   parameters, were presented for rainfall-runoff modeling of the Eel River
   watershed. In the first scenario, the model could present a good insight
   into the watershed hydrologic operation via GGP formulation. In the
   second scenario, an integrated model was proposed to predict runoff in
   stations with lack of data or any point within the watershed due to
   employing the spatially variable geomorphic parameters and rainfall time
   series of the sub-basins as the inputs. This ability of the integrated
   model for the spatiotemporal modeling of the process was examined
   through the cross-validation technique. The results of this research
   demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches due to taking
   advantage of geomorphological features of the watershed.}},

Title = {{AI tools for use in assembly automation and some examples of recent
   applications}},
Journal = {{ASSEMBLY AUTOMATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{184-194}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to review seven artificial intelligence tools
   that are useful in assembly automation: knowledge-based systems, fuzzy
   logic, automatic knowledge acquisition, neural networks, genetic
   algorithms, case-based reasoning and ambient-intelligence.
   Design/methodology/approach - Each artificial intelligence tool is
   outlined, together with some examples of their use in assembly
   automation.
   Findings - Artificial intelligence has produced a number of useful and
   powerful tools. This paper reviews some of those tools. Applications of
   these tools in assembly automation have become more widespread due to
   the power and affordability of present-day computers.
   Research limitations/implications - Many new assembly automation
   applications may emerge and greater use may be made of hybrid tools that
   combine the strengths of two or more of the tools reviewed in the paper.
   The tools and methods reviewed in this paper have minimal computation
   complexity and can be implemented on small assembly lines, single robots
   or systems with low-capability microcontrollers.
   Practical implications - It may take another decade for engineers to
   recognize the benefits given the current lack of familiarity and the
   technical barriers associated with using these tools and it may take a
   long time for direct digital manufacturing to be considered commonplace
   .... but it is expanding. The appropriate deployment of the new AI tools
   will contribute to the creation of more competitive assembly automation
   systems.
   Social implications - Other technological developments in AI that will
   impact on assembly automation include data mining, multi-agent systems
   and distributed self-organising systems.
   Originality/value - The novel approaches proposed use ambient
   intelligence and the mixing of different AI tools in an effort to use
   the best of each technology. The concepts are generically applicable
   across all industrial assembly processes and this research is intended
   to prove that the concepts work in manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a full-scale commercially available magnetorheological
   (MR) brake installed in a semi-active suspension (SAS) system is modeled
   and simulated. Two well-known phenomenological hysteresis models are
   explored: Bouc-Wen and Dahl ones. In particular, influence of their
   parameters on the response is evaluated and assessed. The next step is
   to introduce the artificial neural networks and discuss their
   application in the field of systems identification. Subsequently, two
   feedforward neural networks are created and trained to estimate
   parameters characterizing each of the MR damper models described. The
   semi-active suspension (SAS) system equipped with a MR brake is
   described and the detailed procedure for acquisition of the reference
   data used in the models validation stage is elaborated. The models
   outputs obtained by simulating them with the values of coefficients as
   identified by the networks are compared to each other as well as to the
   reference experimental data. Thanks to that, the comparative analysis
   between the suggested vibration suppression models and the full-scale MR
   brake is done and it is concluded which of the discussed models has a
   better performance. The usability of neural networks in the field of
   parameters estimation of the mathematical models of the real world
   phenomena is described as well. The novelty of the presented methodology
   is the application of artificial intelligence methods to estimate model
   parameters of a MR brake utilized in a SAS system. The results of this
   approach have a strong potential to be successfully implemented in the
   area of model-based control of semi-active vibration suppression
   systems.}},

Title = {{Artificial intelligence framework for simulating clinical
   decision-making: A Markov decision process approach}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{9-19}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: In the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding
   costs/complexity, the growing myriad of treatment options, and exploding
   information streams that often do not effectively reach the front lines
   hinder the ability to choose optimal treatment decisions over time. The
   goal in this paper is to develop a general purpose
   (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence (AI)
   framework to address these challenges. This framework serves two
   potential functions: (1) a simulation environment for exploring various
   healthcare policies, payment methodologies, etc., and (2) the basis for
   clinical artificial intelligence - an AI that can ``think like a
   doctor{''}.
   Methods: This approach combines Markov decision processes and dynamic
   decision networks to learn from clinical data and develop complex plans
   via simulation of alternative sequential decision paths while capturing
   the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic interactions of various
   components in the healthcare system. It can operate in partially
   observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data) by
   maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as
   an online agent that plans and re-plans as actions are performed and new
   observations are obtained. This framework was evaluated using real
   patient data from an electronic health record.
   Results: The results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach; such
   an AI framework easily outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU)
   case-rate/fee-for-service models of healthcare. The cost per unit of
   outcome change (CPUC) was \$189 vs. \$497 for AI vs. TAU (where lower is
   considered optimal) - while at the same time the AI approach could
   obtain a 30-35\% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain AI model
   parameters could further enhance this advantage, obtaining approximately
   50\% more improvement (outcome change) for roughly half the costs.
   Conclusion: Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI
   simulation framework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex
   and uncertain environments. Future work is described that outlines
   potential lines of research and integration of machine learning
   algorithms for personalized medicine. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Mood recognition in bipolar patients through the PSYCHE platform:
   Preliminary evaluations and perspectives}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{49-58}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bipolar disorders are characterized by a series of both
   depressive and manic or hypomanic episodes. Although common and
   expensive to treat, the clinical assessment of bipolar disorder is still
   ill-defined.
   Objective: In the current literature several correlations between mood
   disorders and dysfunctions involving the autonomic nervous system (ANS)
   can be found. The objective of this work is to develop a novel mood
   recognition system based on a pervasive, wearable and personalized
   monitoring system using ANS-related biosignals.
   Materials and methods: The monitoring platform used in this study is the
   core sensing system of the personalized monitoring systems for care in
   mental health (PSYCHE) European project. It is comprised of a
   comfortable sensorized t-shirt that can acquire the inter-beat interval
   time series, the heart rate, and the respiratory dynamics for long-term
   monitoring during the day and overnight. In this study, three bipolar
   patients were followed for a period of 90 days during which up to six
   monitoring sessions and psychophysical evaluations were performed for
   each patient. Specific signal processing techniques and artificial
   intelligence algorithms were applied to analyze more than 120 h of data.
   Results: Experimental results are expressed in terms of confusion
   matrices and an exhaustive descriptive statistics of the most relevant
   features is reported as well. A classification accuracy of about 97\% is
   achieved for the intra-subject analysis. Such an accuracy was found in
   distinguishing relatively good affective balance state (euthymia) from
   severe clinical states (severe depression and mixed state) and is lower
   in distinguishing euthymia from the milder states (accuracy up to 88\%).
   Conclusions: The PSYCHE platform could provide a viable decision support
   system in order to improve mood assessment in patient care. Evidences
   about the correlation between mood disorders and ANS dysfunctions were
   found and the obtained results are promising for an effective
   biosignal-based mood recognition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Solving Unconstrained Global Optimization Problems via Hybrid Swarm
   Intelligence Approaches}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Stochastic global optimization (SGO) algorithms such as the particle
   swarm optimization (PSO) approach have become popular for solving
   unconstrained global optimization (UGO) problems. The PSO approach,
   which belongs to the swarm intelligence domain, does not require
   gradient information, enabling it to overcome this limitation of
   traditional nonlinear programming methods. Unfortunately, PSO algorithm
   implementation and performance depend on several parameters, such as
   cognitive parameter, social parameter, and constriction coefficient.
   These parameters are tuned by using trial and error. To reduce the
   parametrization of a PSO method, this work presents two efficient hybrid
   SGO approaches, namely, a real-coded genetic algorithm-based PSO
   (RGA-PSO) method and an artificial immune algorithm-based PSO (AIA-PSO)
   method. The specific parameters of the internal PSO algorithm are
   optimized using the external RGA and AIA approaches, and then the
   internal PSO algorithm is applied to solve UGO problems. The
   performances of the proposed RGA-PSO and AIA-PSO algorithms are then
   evaluated using a set of benchmark UGO problems. Numerical results
   indicate that, besides their ability to converge to a global minimum for
   each test UGO problem, the proposed RGA-PSO and AIA-PSO algorithms
   outperform many hybrid SGO algorithms. Thus, the RGA-PSO and AIA-PSO
   approaches can be considered alternative SGO approaches for solving
   standard-dimensional UGO problems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel ensemble learning approach based on logistic
   regression (LR) and artificial intelligence tool, that is, support
   vector machine (SVM) and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN), for
   corporate financial distress forecasting in fashion and textiles supply

   art, interaction is a very important element. Unique interactions,
   peculiar enjoyments or entertaining elements make digital art works look
   like a game. Various types of interaction are being implemented in
   digital art using touch, sound, movement, etc. Some digital art works
   are even called game art because game-like elements are expressed
   strongly. In general, interactive works adopting concepts such as
   ``goal{''} or ``contest{''} can be called game art. Digital art is quite
   similar to games by nature. An important fact is that those having the
   nature of game induce the spectators' involvement and immersion more
   than simple interactive works. The reason that artists include
   interactive components in their works is that they want the spectators'
   deeper appreciation and involvement. However, many of interactive works
   fail to induce interaction as much as the artists expect. If visible
   interaction is weak, spectators are not immersed much in the work.
   This study purposes to apply and implement to express digital art using
   the reinforcement learning technology, which is used in games that are
   highly interactive contents, for the interactivity of digital art works,
   and to evaluate and discuss the results. In this study, the
   reinforcement learning theory was applied to our art work ``The
   Flying,{''} a flight simulation game created as a digital art work using
   Kinect. This work is a game art for learning how to fly. It expresses
   the human desire to fly through the process of a bird's flying training,
   and in the process the spectator appreciates the work through
   reinforcement learning.}},

Title = {{GREEDY INTERACTION ELEMENTS COVERAGE ANALYSIS FOR AI-BASED T-WAY
   STRATEGIES}},
Journal = {{MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{23-33}},
Abstract = {{Recently, many researchers have started to adopt Artificial Intelligence
   AI-based strategies for t-way testing. Here, each interaction is covered
   at most once whenever possible. In many AI-based strategies, sampling
   for the most optimal test cases is given utmost priority, but measuring
   of the interaction coverage metric per test case is often neglected. In
   the situation where not all test cases can be executed due to
   constraints on project deadline, the availability of interaction
   coverage metric per test case can be a useful indicator on how greedy
   each AI-based strategy of interests is. In this manner, test engineers
   can make informed decision on the selection of suitable strategies for
   use. In this paper, this study presents a systematic analysis of
   existing AI-based strategies including that of Hill Climbing HC,
   Simulated Annealing SA, Tabu Search TS, Great Flood GF, Particle Swarm
   Optimization PSTG and Harmonic Search Strategy HSS as far as its rate of
   coverage per test case is concerned. In doing so, this paper
   demonstrates that HSS, in most cases, gives competitive interaction
   coverage rate as compared to competing AI-based strategies but with less
   number of iterations.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{This paper designs a tangible programming tool, E-Block, for children
   aged 5 to 9 to experience the preliminary understanding of programming
   by building blocks. With embedded artificial intelligence, the tool
   defines the programming blocks with the sensors as the input and enables
   children to write programs to complete the tasks in the computer. The
   symbol on the programming block's surface is used to help children
   understanding the function of each block. The sequence information is
   transferred to computer by microcomputers and then translated into
   semantic information. The system applies wireless and infrared
   technologies and provides user with feedbacks on both screen and
   programming blocks. Preliminary user studies using observation and user
   interview methods are shown for E-Block's prototype. The test results
   prove that E-Block is attractive to children and easy to learn and use.
   The project also highlights potential advantages of using single chip
   microcomputer (SCM) technology to develop tangible programming tools for
   children.}},

Abstract = {{The basis of an efficient functioning of a power grid is an accurate
   balancing of the electricity demand of all the consumers at any instant
   with supply. Nowadays, this task involves only the grid operator and
   retail electricity providers. One of the facets of the Smart Grid vision
   is that consumers may have a more active role in the problem of
   balancing demand with supply. With the deployment of intelligent
   information and communication technologies in domestic environments,
   homes are becoming smarter and able to play a more active role in the
   management of energy. We use the term Smart Consumer Load Balancing to
   refer to algorithms that are run by energy management systems of homes
   in order to optimise the electricity consumption, to minimise costs
   and/or meet supply constraints. In this work, we analyse different
   approaches to Smart Consumer Load Balancing based on (distributed)
   artificial intelligence. We also put forward a new model of Smart
   Consumer Load Balancing, where consumers actively participate in the
   balancing of demand with supply by forming groups that agree on a joint
   demand profile to be contracted in the market with the mediation of an
   aggregator. We specify the business model as well as the optimisation
   model for load balancing, showing the economic benefits for the
   consumers in a realistic scenario based on the Spanish electricity
   market.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a novel approach for channel equalization is presented,
   where a framework for Volterra system is used to model both the channel
   and the equalizer. We propose development of first-order and
   second-order Volterra equalizers using minimum mean square error (MMSE)
   approach and design these equalizers using swarm intelligence based
   stochastic optimization algorithm which is applied to adapt the
   equalizer coefficients to the time varying channel. This work proposes
   to use the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, recently introduced
   for global optimization, simulating the intelligent foraging behavior of
   honey bee swarm in a simple, robust, and flexible manner. For
   comparative analysis, adaptive equalizers like least mean squares (LMSs)
   equalizer, recursive least squares (RLSs) equalizer and least mean
   p-Norm (LMP) equalizer and population based optimum equalizers employing
   PSO are also applied for identical problems and the superiority of the
   newly proposed algorithm is aptly demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In recent years, a huge number of biological problems have been
   successfully addressed through computational techniques, among all these
   computational techniques we highlight metaheuristics. Also, most of
   these biological problems are directly related to genomic, studying the
   microorganisms, plants, and animals genomes. In this work, we solve a
   DNA sequence analysis problem called Motif Discovery Problem (MDP) by
   using two novel algorithms based on swarm intelligence: Artificial Bee
   Colony (ABC) and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA). To guide the
   pattern search to solutions that have a better biological relevance, we
   have redefined the problem formulation and incorporated several
   biological constraints that should be satisfied by each solution. One of
   the most important characteristics of the problem definition is the
   application of multiobjective optimization (MOO), maximizing three
   conflicting objectives: motif length, support, and similarity. So, we
   have adapted our algorithms to the multiobjective context. This paper
   presents an exhaustive comparison of both multiobjective proposals on
   instances of different nature: real instances, generic instances, and
   instances generated according to a Markov chain. To analyze their
   operations we have used several indicators and statistics, comparing
   their results with those obtained by standard algorithms in
   multiobjective computation, and by 14 well-known biological methods. (C)

Abstract = {{A bio-robot system refers to an animal equipped with Brain-Computer
   Interface (BCI), through which the outer stimulation is delivered
   directly into the animal's brain to control its behaviors. The
   development of bio-robots suffers from the dependency on real-time
   guidance by human operators. Because of its inherent difficulties, there
   is no feasible method for automatic controlling of bio-robots yet. In
   this paper, we propose a new method to realize the automatic navigation
   for bio-robots. A General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) is adopted to
   analyze and model the controlling procedure of human operations.
   Comparing.to the traditional approaches with explicit controlling rules,
   our algorithm learns the controlling process and imitates the
   decision-making of human-beings to steer the rat-robot automatically. In
   real-time navigation experiments, our method successfully controls
   bio-robots to follow given paths automatically and precisely. This work
   would be significant for future applications of bio-robots and provide a
   new way to realize hybrid intelligent systems with artificial
   intelligence and natural biological intelligence combined together.}},

Abstract = {{The digital universe is expanding at very high rates. New ways of
   retrieving and enriching text and audio content are required. In this
   work, a methodology for actor level emotion magnitude prediction in text
   and speech is proposed. A model is trained to predict emotion magnitudes
   per actor at any point in a story using previous emotion magnitudes plus
   current text and speech features which act on the actor's emotional
   state. The methodology compares linear and non-linear regression
   techniques to determine the optimal model that fits the data. Results of
   the analysis show that non-linear regression models based on Support
   Vector Regression (SVR) using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel
   provide the most accurate prediction model. An analysis of the
   contribution of the features for emotion magnitude prediction is
   performed.}},

Abstract = {{Recent technological advances in the power generation and information
   technologies areas are helping to change the modern electricity supply
   system in order to comply with higher energy efficiency and
   sustainability standards. Smart grids are an emerging trend that
   introduce intelligence in the power grid to optimize resource usage. In
   order for this intelligence to be effective, it is necessary to retrieve
   enough information about the grid operation together with other context
   data such as environmental variables, and intelligently modify the
   behavior of the network elements accordingly. This article presents a
   multi-agent system model for virtual power plants, a new power plant
   concept in which generation no longer occurs in big installations, but
   is the result of the cooperation of smaller and more intelligent
   elements. The proposed model is not only focused on the management of
   the different elements, but includes a set of agents embedded with
   artificial neural networks for collaborative forecasting of
   disaggregated energy demand of domestic end users, the results of which
   are also shown in this article.}},

Abstract = {{Development of complex robotics systems usually requires tools and
   software frameworks such as the WillowGarage Robot Operating System
   (ROS) to ease code integration and reuse tasks. Nevertheless, research
   in robotics is increasingly becoming multidisciplinary, involving areas
   of voice technology, artificial intelligence or web systems, which can
   make researchers highly reluctant to use such robotic-specific systems.
   Even existing constraints, such as using different Operating Systems,
   can make this task impossible. This paper presents a novel architecture
   completely based on standards such as Web Services, that allows a
   totally decoupled development of agents with minimal intrusiveness and
   high simplicity by using a dynamic broker to interconnect agents at
   runtime. This architecture, which does not replace other systems but
   complements them. It has been used successfully inside a complex
   multi-robot demonstrator in a fully automated system deployment of an
   interactive tour guide robot in a new environment.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Control of the synchronous generator, also referred to as an alternator,
   has always remained very significant in power system operation and
   control. Alternator output is proportional to load angle, but as the
   parameter is moved up, the power system security approaches the extreme
   limit. Hence, generators are operated well below their steady state
   stability limit for the secure operation of a power system. This raises
   demand for efficient and fast controllers. Artificial intelligence,
   specifically artificial neural network (ANN), is emerging very rapidly
   and has become an efficient tool for operation and control of power
   systems. ANN requires considerable time to tune weights, but it is fast
   and accurate once tuned properly. Previously, ANNs have been trained
   with high-dimensional input space or have been trained online. Hence,
   either one requires considerable time to yield the control signal or is
   a bit risky technique to apply in interconnected power systems. In this
   study, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN is proposed to control
   generator excitation trained with low-dimensional input space. Moreover,
   MLP has been trained offline to avert the risk potential of online
   training. The results illustrate preeminence of the proposed
   neurocontroller-based excitation system over the conventional
   controllers-based excitation system.}},

Abstract = {{Different methods and methodologies have been developed for building
   ontologies. However, neither of these methods consider to build an
   ontology with characteristics of an electronic document management
   system (EDMS) nor define the basic classes to begin the ontology. In
   this paper we propose a method, called ``OntoDocMan{''}, to build an
   ontology-based EDMS which captures the knowledge associated with a
   company's processes related to a quality standard. We leverage the use
   of ontology tools, such as Prot,g,, to obtain the functionality of an
   EDMS. Our method complements and details the On-To-Knowledge methodology
   during its ontology development phase. The essential point of our method
   is to make it easy to develop an EDMS for quality standards by means of
   an ontology-based system. The OntoDocMan method is illustrated by a case
   study for developing an ontology based on the ISO/TS 16949, which is a
   Technical Specification (TS) and we show that the Ontology system is
   friendly and easy to use as any EDMS. Different from common EDMS, our
   ontology-based EDMS is developed without any programming. In addition,
   we have discovered that this kind of ontology-based EDMS is an excellent
   tool for helping auditors to search and validate information, besides
   new employees can learn about the company's processes.}},

Abstract = {{In the last years, several combinatorial optimisation problems have
   arisen in the computer communications networking field. In many cases,
   for solving these problems it is necessary the use of meta-heuristics.
   An important problem in communication networks is the Terminal
   Assignment Problem (TAP). Our goal is to minimise the link cost of large
   balanced communication networks. TAP is a NP-Hard problem. The
   intractability of this problem is the motivation for the pursuits of
   Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms that produce approximate, rather than
   exact, solutions. This paper makes a comparison among the effectiveness
   of three SI algorithms: Ant Colony Optimisation, Discrete Particle Swarm
   Optimisation and Artificial Bee Colony. We also compare the SI
   algorithms with several algorithms from literature. Simulation results
   verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The results show
   that SI algorithms provide good solutions in a better running time. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a personalized e-course composition based on a
   genetic algorithm with forcing legality (called GA{*}) in adaptive
   learning systems, which efficiently and accurately finds appropriate
   e-learning materials in the database for individual learners. The
   forcing legality operation not only reduces the search space size and
   increases search efficiency but also is more explicit in finding the
   best e-course composition in a legal solution space. In serial
   experiments, the forcing legality operation is applied in Chu et al.'s
   the particle swarm optimization (called PSO{*}) and Dheeban et al.'s the
   improved particle swarm optimization (called RPSO{*}) to show the
   forcing legality can speed up the computational time and reduce the
   computational complexity of algorithm. Furthermore, GA{*} regardless of
   the number of students or the number of materials in the database, to
   compose a personalized e-course within a limited time is much more
   efficient and accurate than PSO{*} and RPSO{*}. For the experiment
   increasing the number of students to 1200, the average improvement
   ratios of errors (learning concept error, materials difficulty error,
   learning time error), fitness value, stability, and execution time are
   above 96\%, 79\%, 90\%, and 10\%, respectively. For the experiment
   increasing the number of materials to 500 and the execution time set to
   the shortest execution time of RPSO{*}, the average improvement ratios
   of errors (learning concept error, materials difficulty error, learning
   time error), fitness value, and stability are above 97\%, 51\%, and
   80\%, respectively. Therefore, GAS is able to enhance the quality of
   personalized e-course compositions in adaptive learning environments.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an intelligence based protective relay data
   acquisition system to correct current transformers and capacitive
   voltage transformers secondary waveform distortions. The protective
   relay data acquisition system receives voltage and current signals from
   current transformers and capacitive voltage transformers and prepares
   the inputs to the main board after some pre-processing. Current
   transformers and capacitive voltage transformers provide instrument
   level current and voltage signals to meters and protective relays in
   high voltage and extra high voltage systems. The accuracy and
   performance of protective relays in high voltage and extra high voltage
   systems are directly related to steady state and transient performance
   of current transformers and capacitive voltage transformers. Current
   transformers saturation and capacitive voltage transformers transient
   could lead to protective relay mal-operation or even prevent tripping.
   The key of the proposed scheme is to use artificial neural network to
   achieve the inverse transfer functions of current transformers and

Abstract = {{Current Artificial Intelligence systems are bound to become increasingly
   interconnected to their surrounding environment in the view of the newly
   rising Ambient Intelligence (Aml) perspective. In this paper, we present
   a comprehensive Aml framework for performing fusion of raw data,
   perceived by sensors of different nature, in order to extract
   higher-level information according to a model structured so as to
   resemble the perceptual signal processing occurring in the human nervous
   system. Following the guidelines of the greater BICA challenge, we
   selected the specific task of user presence detection in a locality of
   the system as a representative application clarifying the potentialities
   of cognitive models. Specifically, our contribution lies in the
   definition of a suitable model for knowledge representation and
   management; our goal is to make the artificial system able to understand
   the environment in which it acts, analogously to the way the human brain
   acts. In our system, the fusion of several information flows is
   performed by a Hidden Markov Model that allows to deal with
   heterogeneous data, potentially affected by a non-negligible degree of
   uncertainty, also taking into account the history of past perceptions.
   Sensory data are provided to the inference engine by a sensor network
   acting as a ``peripheral nervous system{''} which performs a preliminary
   processing, thus mimicking a mechanism present in the human beings. Our
   cognitive approach to information fusion is not limited to the specific
   case study, but it can be easily generalizable to any context
   characterized by a striking heterogeneity in the sensory system.
   Promising results have been obtained during the assessment of the
   information fusion model which performed very satisfactorily in terms of
   specificity and sensitivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a novel Hybrid Intelligent Intrusion Detection
   System (IDS) known as RT-MOVICAB-IDS that incorporates temporal control.
   One of its main goals is to facilitate real-time Intrusion Detection, as
   accurate and swift responses are crucial in this field, especially if
   automatic abortion mechanisms are running. The formulation of this
   hybrid IDS combines Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Case-Based
   Reasoning (CBR) within a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to detect intrusions
   in dynamic computer networks. Temporal restrictions are imposed on this
   IDS, in order to perform real/execution time processing and assure
   system response predictability. Therefore, a dynamic real-time
   multi-agent architecture for IDS is proposed in this study, allowing the
   addition of predictable agents (both reactive and deliberative). In
   particular, two of the deliberative agents deployed in this system
   incorporate temporal-bounded CBR. This upgraded CBR is based on an
   anytime approximation, which allows the adaptation of this Artificial
   Intelligence paradigm to real-time requirements. Experimental results
   using real data sets are presented which validate the performance of
   this novel hybrid IDS. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to analyze alternative forecasting methods
   that produce results at least similar to or better than linear
   regression (MLR) that can be used in the modeling of social systems.
   While organizations may be considered as typically non-linear systems,
   the common feature of most models found in literature continues to be
   the use of linear regression techniques. From a case study, advanced
   statistical methods of Gaussian and Kriging are evaluated, as well as an
   artificial intelligence (AI) tool, the radial basis function (RBF). The
   results show the best performance of the suggested methods compared to
   MLR, especially RBF, because of its uniform prediction behavior
   throughout all ranges of evaluation. These techniques, although somewhat
   unconventional in social systems modeling, present a potential
   contribution in increasing the accuracy and precision of the predictions
   allowing a more accurate assessment of the impact of certain strategies
   on the project performance to be made before the allocation of material,
   human and financial resources. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is a non-linear parameter
   learning algorithm that converges accurately and quickly. This paper
   demonstrates for the first time to our knowledge, a real-time
   implementation of the LM algorithm on field programmable gate arrays
   (FPGAs). It was used to train neural networks to solve the eXclusive Or
   function (XOR), and for 3D-to-2D camera calibration parameter
   estimation. A Xilinx Virtex-5 ML506 was used to implement the LMA as a
   hard-ware-in-the-loop system. The XOR function was approximated in only
   13 iterations from zero initial conditions, usually the same function is
   approximated in thousands of iterations using the error backpropagation
   algorithm. Also, this type of training not only reduced the number of
   iterations but also achieved a speed up in excess of 3 x 106 when
   compared to the software implementation. A real-time camera calibration
   and parameter estimation was performed successfully on FPGAs. Compared
   to the software implementation the FPGA implementation led to an
   increase in the mean squared error and standard deviation by only
   17.94\% and 8.04\% respectively. The FPGA increased the calibration
   speed by a factor of 1.41 x 10(6). There are a wide range of systems
   problems solved via nonlinear parameter optimization, this study
   demonstrated that a hardware solution for systems such as automated
   optical inspection systems or systems dealing with projective geometry
   estimation and motion compensation systems in robotic vision systems is
   possible in real time.}},

Abstract = {{The fuzzy optimization problem is one of the prominent topics in the
   broad area of artificial intelligence. It is applicable in the field of
   non-linear fuzzy programming. Its application as well as practical
   realization can been seen in all the real world problems. In this paper
   a large scale non-linear fuzzy programming problem was solved by hybrid
   optimization techniques like Line Search (LS), Simulated Annealing (SA)
   and Pattern Search (PS). An industrial production planning problem with
   a cubic objective function, eight decision variables and 29 constraints
   was solved successfully using the LS-SA-PS hybrid optimization
   techniques. The computational results for the objective function with
   respect to vagueness factor and level of satisfaction has been provided
   in the form of 2D and 3D plots. The outcome is very promising and
   strongly suggests that the hybrid LS-SA-PS algorithm is very efficient

   filtering algorithms leads to an increase in accuracy of instance-based

   results with 20 different algorithms and 8 credit databases show that
   the filtered sets perform significantly better than the non-preprocessed
   training sets when using the nearest neighbour decision rule. The
   experiments also allow to identify which techniques are most robust and

   sensors and artificial intelligence concepts towards the same objective:
   adding more intelligence to a programmable communicating thermostat
   (PCT), for better energy management and conservation in smart homes. A
   house simulator was developed and used as an ``expert system shell{''}
   to assist in implementation and verification of the OLA algorithm. The
   role of PCT is to provide consumer with a means to manage and reduce
   energy use, while accommodating their every day schedules, preferences
   and needs. In this paper, the actual results of learning and
   adaptability of a PCT equipped with OLA, as a result of the occupant's
   pattern/schedule changes, and in general, the overall system
   improvements with respect to energy consumption and savings are
   demonstrated via simulation for the zone controlled home equipped with
   OLA and Knowledge Base, versus a home without zone control, Knowledge
   Base nor OLA.}},

Abstract = {{Support vector machines (SVMs) are a relatively recent machine learning
   technique. One of the SVM problems is that SVM is considerably slower in

   its practical use. To address this problem, we propose an artificial bee
   colony (ABC) algorithm to search for an optimal subset of the set of
   support vectors obtained through the training of the SVM, such that the
   original discriminant function is best approximated. Experimental
   results show that the proposed ABC algorithm outperforms some other

Abstract = {{This paper develops a high performance PI based controller for an
   Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (IPMSM) drive. An artificial
   neural network is used for on-line tuning of the PI controller. The
   Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been used in this work in order to obtain the
   optimized values of the controller parameters for precise speed control
   for different operating conditions over a wide speed range. In this
   paper, an integral Anti-Windup (AW) strategy for the PI speed controller
   is also utilized to suppress the undesired side effect known as
   integrator windup when large set-point changes are made.
   The optimal behavior of the drive can be achieved by considering two
   control strategies: Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) and Flux-Weakening
   (FW).
   In developing the proposed controller, the PI controller parameters and,
   also, the anti-windup strategy are optimized by GA for some operating
   conditions, in a closed loop vector control scheme. By obtaining the
   parameters at a number of points in the possible operating region, a
   look-up table approach has been completed. Then, an ANN is trained by
   this look-up table. Ultimately, the well-trained ANN is utilized for
   on-line tuning of the controller parameters to ensure optimum drive
   performance under different disturbances and operating conditions. (c)

Abstract = {{The video game industry is an emerging market which continues to expand.
   From its early beginning, developers have focused mainly on sound and
   graphical applications, paying less attention to developing game bots or
   other kinds of nonplayer characters (NPCs). However, recent advances in
   artificial intelligence offer the possibility of developing game bots
   which are dynamically adjustable to several difficulty levels as well as
   variable game environments. Previous works reveal a lack of swarm
   intelligence approaches to develop these kinds of agents. Considering
   the potential of particle swarm optimization due to its emerging
   properties and self-adaptation to dynamic environments, further
   investigation into this field must be undertaken. This research focuses
   on developing a generic framework based on swarm intelligence, and in
   particular on ant colony optimization, such as it allows general
   implementation of real-time bots that work over dynamic game
   environments. The framework has been adapted to allow the implementation
   of intelligent agents for the classical game Ms. Pac-Man. These were
   trialed at the Ms. Pac-Man competitions held during the 2011
   International Congress on Evolutionary Computation.}},

Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{157-166}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Modeling and recognizing spatiotemporal, as opposed to static input, is
   a challenging task since it incorporates input dynamics as part of the
   problem. The vast majority of existing methods tackle the problem as an
   extension of the static counterpart, using dynamics, such as input
   derivatives, at feature level and adopting artificial intelligence and
   machine learning techniques originally designed for solving problems
   that do not specifically address the temporal aspect. The proposed
   approach deals with temporal and spatial aspects of the spatiotemporal
   domain in a discriminative as well as coupling manner. Self Organizing
   Maps (SOM) model the spatial aspect of the problem and Markov models its
   temporal counterpart. Incorporation of adjacency, both in training and
   classification, enhances the overall architecture with robustness and
   adaptability. The proposed scheme is validated both theoretically,
   through an error propagation study, and experimentally, on the
   recognition of individual signs, performed by different, native Greek
   Sign Language users. Results illustrate the architecture's superiority
   when compared to Hidden Markov Model techniques and variations both in
   terms of classification performance and computational cost. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Gaze following, the ability to redirect one's visual attention to look
   at what another person is seeing, is foundational for imitation, word
   learning, and theory-of-mind. Previous theories have suggested that the
   development of gaze following in human infants is the product of a basic
   gaze following mechanism, plus the gradual incorporation of several
   distinct new mechanisms that improve the skill, such as spatial
   inference, and the ability to use eye direction information as well as
   head direction. In this paper, we offer an alternative explanation based
   on a single learning mechanism. From a starting state with no knowledge
   of the implications of another organism's gaze direction, our model
   learns to follow gaze by being placed in a simulated environment where
   an adult caregiver looks around at objects. Our infant model matches the
   development of gaze following in human infants as measured in key
   experiments that we replicate and analyze in detail.}},

   values (E-pit), different environmental conditions have been tested
   varying chloride ion concentration, pH value and temperature. The

   Several classification techniques have been used: Classification Trees

Abstract = {{The occurrence of fault is an unwanted situation in electric power
   systems where certain network parts detach themselves from the remaining
   unaffected part of the network. The relay protection system has a task
   to isolate the faulty units or zone. When a certain protection level is
   being triggered alarms are sent to the transformer station and the
   dispatcher centre. These alarms reach the dispatcher centre in a short
   period of time which can lead the dispatcher to confusion and possible
   mistakes. To ease the dispatcher's position, an alarm processor is
   introduced. The alarm processor uses an expert system as its computer

   the ones being triggered while the TS 35/10 kV Istok is detaching from

Abstract = {{The estimation of large infrastructural structures, such as bridges
   among others, has mainly been confined to estimation of their
   construction value. The estimation procedure of a real, i.e. objective
   value implies estimation of a larger number of attributes except the
   ones that represent construction value of a structure, such as:
   location, namely location potential, traffic, sociological, ecological
   and other parameters that represent a set of attributes affecting market
   value, i.e. usability of infrastructural structures. This paper deals
   with devising decision rules that define this market value, i.e.
   usability, as well as with reducing core of attributes, based on which
   actual value estimation of bridges is carried out through implementation
   of rough sets theory. The implementation of this theory facilitates the
   objective formulation of artificial intelligence rules that define
   parameters referring to determining the value of bridges, as well as to
   reducing the decision rules that lead to the estimation of their optimal
   value.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission site selection and configuration for cellular networks is
   in general an NP-hard optimization problem. Consequently efforts to
   improve tractability are very valuable and meta-heuristic algorithms are
   now commonly applied in artificial intelligence frameworks and expert
   systems. The speed of network evaluation is a binding constraint on
   performance of meta-heuristic techniques. This is particularly
   challenging for CDMA-based systems because power allocation is required
   before coverage can be evaluated. The current most efficient heuristic
   for achieving this requires time where n (cell) is the number of cells
   and n (stp) is the number of active user locations. In the large-scale
   scenarios that arise in practice, n (stp) is large compared to n (cell)
   and consequently tractability is significantly impeded by n (stp) .
   We introduce a new approach to improve tractability for the network
   planning problem. This concerns changing the resolution of the problem
   scenario by creating virtual entities which combine spatial traffic
   requirements, thus reducing the number of n (stp) that require
   evaluation. By solving a linear programming formulation of the planning
   problem exactly (for small instances) and using a heuristic (for large
   instances), we examine in detail the change in quality of solution that
   this method induces. The results show that only a marginal reduction in
   quality of network evaluation is observed, while computational
   tractability is improved.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction to SAT is a very successful approach to solving hard
   combinatorial problems in Artificial Intelligence and computer science
   in general. Most commonly, problem instances reduced to SAT are solved
   with a general-purpose SAT solver. Although there is the obvious
   possibility of improving the SAT solving process with
   application-specific heuristics, this has rarely been done successfully.
   In this work we propose a planning-specific variable selection strategy
   for SAT solving. The strategy is based on generic principles about
   properties of plans, and its performance with standard planning
   benchmarks often substantially improves on generic variable selection
   heuristics, such as VSIDS, and often lifts it to the same level with
   other search methods such as explicit state-space search with heuristic
   search algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes two new models based on artificial bee colony (ABC)
   and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques to estimate electricity

   models (ABCEE and PSOEE) are developed by incorporating gross domestic

   inputs. All models are proposed in two forms, linear and quadratic. Also
   different neighbor selection mechanisms are attempted for ABCEE model to
   increase convergence to minimum of the algorithm. In order to indicate
   the applicability and accuracy of the proposed models, a comparison is
   made with ant colony optimization (ACO) which is available for the same
   problem in the literature. According to obtained results, relative
   estimation errors of the proposed models are lower than ACO and
   quadratic form provides better-fit solutions than linear form due to
   fluctuations of the socio-economic indicators. Finally, Turkey's
   electricity energy demand is projected until 2025 according to three

   handling is explicitly taken care by implanting augmented lagrangian
   concept. To demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, its performance
   are evaluated and compared on 10 benchmarked problems (made constrained

Abstract = {{Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is a widely-used method to detect the power
   transformer faults, because of its high sensitivity to small amount of
   electrical faults. The DGA is exploited for fault classification tools
   implementation using the artificial intelligence techniques. In this
   study, we use the Rogers ratios, the Doernenburg ratios methods and our
   proposed combination of Rogers and Doernenburg ratios DGA methods as gas
   signature. The multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) is applied
   for decision making. The paper presents a comparative study on one hand
   for the choice the most appropriate DGA method and to resolve the
   problem of conflict between the Rogers and Doernenburg ratios methods.
   On the other hand, it compares the various MLP architectures by
   comparing two output data types and three hidden layer types with the
   aim to establish the most appropriate MLP model. Before testing, the
   proposed structures are trained and tested by the experimental data from
   Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG). The test results suggest
   that MLPNN ratios combination can generalize better than other MLPNN
   models. The approach has the advantages of high accuracy. The other
   advantage is that the model is practically applicable and may be
   utilized for an automated power transformer diagnosis. The
   classification accuracies of the MLPNN classifier are compared with
   fuzzy logic (FL), radial basis function (RBF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN)
   and probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifiers. The test results
   indicate that the developed preprocessing approach can significantly
   improve the diagnosis accuracies for power transformer fault
   classification. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new decision making/optimization paradigm, the
   decision making/optimization in changeable spaces (DM/OCS). The unique
   feature of DM/OCS is that it incorporates human psychology and its
   dynamics as part of the decision making process and allows the
   restructuring of the decision parameters. DM/OCS is based on Habitual
   Domain theory, the decision parameters, the concept of competence set,
   and the mental operators 7-8-9 principles of deep knowledge. The
   covering and discovering processes are formulated as DM/OCS problems.
   Some illustrative examples of challenging problems that cannot be solved
   by traditional decision making/optimization techniques are formulated as
   DM/OCS problems and solved. In addition, some directions of research
   related to innovation dynamics, management, artificial intelligence,
   artificial and e-economics, scientific discovery, and knowledge
   extraction are provided in the conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Many researchers have focused on the satisfiability problem and on many
   of its variants due to its applicability in many areas of artificial
   intelligence. This NP-complete problem refers to the task of finding a

   In this work, we introduce a memetic algorithm that makes use of the
   multilevel paradigm. The multilevel paradigm refers to the process of
   dividing large and difficult problems into smaller ones, which are
   hopefully much easier to solve, and then work backward toward the
   solution of the original problem, using a solution from a previous level
   as a starting solution at the next level. Results comparing the memetic
   with and without the multilevel paradigm are presented using problem
   instances drawn from real industrial hardware designs.}},

Abstract = {{The translational challenge in biomedical research lies in the effective
   and efficient transfer of mechanistic knowledge from one biological
   context to another. Implicit in this process is the establishment of
   causality from correlation in the form of mechanistic hypotheses.
   Effectively addressing the translational challenge requires the use of
   automated methods, including the ability to computationally capture the
   dynamic aspect of putative hypotheses such that they can be evaluated in
   a high throughput fashion. Ontologies provide structure and organization
   to biomedical knowledge; converting these representations into
   executable models/simulations is the next necessary step. Researchers
   need the ability to map their conceptual models into a model
   specification that can be transformed into an executable simulation
   program. We suggest this mapping process, which approximates certain
   steps in the development of a computational model, can be expressed as a
   set of logical rules, and a semi-intelligent computational agent, the
   Computational Modeling Assistant (CMA), can perform reasoning to develop
   a plan to achieve the construction of an executable model. Presented
   herein is a description and implementation for a model construction
   reasoning process between biomedical and simulation ontologies that is
   performed by the CMA to produce the specification of an executable model
   that can be used for dynamic knowledge representation.}},

Abstract = {{This research work looks at methods for controlling a two-phase
   distillation column system. The present system consists of a vertical
   column with a number of trays used for component separation. It also has
   a reboiler and a condenser; these are used to provide heating and
   cooling for vaporization and condensation, respectively. The proposed
   control scheme uses the model-based predictive control (MBPC) scheme
   with the internal model being produced by a set of Takagi Sugeno Kang
   (TSK) fuzzy-based models. The internal set of TSK fuzzy-based models are
   developed from a linear models predictive approach. That is, it makes a
   prediction of the present system using a set of TSK fuzzy-based models
   identified, at each instant of time. The control scheme is then
   evaluated using simulation and compared with a benchmark fuzzy-based PI
   control scheme. The novelty of the present research is to propose a new
   organization in system modeling and its control scheme by combining the
   MBPC scheme and artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques for the

Abstract = {{At the present, emotion is considered as a critical point of human
   behaviour, and thus it should be embedded within the reasoning module
   when an intelligent system or a autonomous robot aims to emulate or

   Intelligence shows an increasing interest in artificial emotion research
   for developing human-like systems. Based on Thayer's emotion model and
   Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, this paper presents a proposal for forecasting
   artificial emotions. It provides an innovative method for forecasting
   artificial emotions and designing an affective decision system. This
   work includes an experiment with three simulated artificial scenarios
   for testing the proposal. Each scenario generate different emotions
   according to the artificial experimental model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Abstract = {{Future science-driven landing missions, conceived to collect in situ
   data on regions of planetary bodies that have the highest potential to
   yield important scientific discoveries, will require a higher degree of
   autonomy. The latter includes the ability of the spacecraft to
   autonomously select the landing site using real-time data acquired
   during the descent phase. This paper presents the development of an
   Evolutionary Fuzzy Cognitive Map (E-FCM) model that implements an
   artificial intelligence system capable of autonomously selecting a
   landing site with the highest potential for scientific discoveries
   constrained by the requirement of soft landing in a region with safe
   terrains. The proposed E-FCM evolves its internal states and
   interconnections as a function of real-time data collected during the
   descent phase, therefore improving the decision process as more accurate
   information becomes available. The E-FCM is constructed using knowledge
   accumulated by planetary experts and it is tested on scenarios that
   simulate the decision process during the descent phase toward the Hyndla
   Regio on Venus. The E-FCM is shown to quickly reach conclusions that are
   consistent with what would be the choice of a planetary expert if the
   scientist were presented with the same information. The proposed
   methodology is fast and efficient and may be suitable for on-board
   spacecraft implementation and real-time decision making during the
   course of robotic exploration of the Solar System. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.

Abstract = {{An artificial neural network (ANN)-based technology - a `Grey-Box',
   originating the iterative selection, depiction, and quantitation of
   environmental relationships for modeling microalgal abundance, as
   chlorophyll (CHL) a, was developed and evaluated. Due to their robust
   capability for reproducing the complexities underlying chaotic,
   non-linear systems. ANNs have become popular for the modeling of
   ecosystem structure and function. However, ANNs exhibit a holistic
   deficiency in declarative knowledge structure (i.e. a `black-box'). The
   architecture of the Grey-Box provided the benefit of the ANN modeling
   structure, while deconvolving the interaction of prediction potentials
   among environmental variables upon CHL a. The influences of (pairs of)
   predictors upon the variance and magnitude of CHL a were depicted via
   pedagogical knowledge extraction (multi-dimensional response surfaces).
   This afforded derivation of mathematical equations for iterative
   predictive outcomes of CHL a and together with an algorithmic expression
   across iterations, corrected for the lack of declarative knowledge
   within conventional ANNs. Importantly, the Grey-Box `bridged the gap'
   between `white-box' parametric models and black-box ANNs in terms of
   performance and mathematical transparency. Grey-Box formulations are
   relevant to ecological niche modeling, identification of biotic
   response(s) to stress/disturbance thresholds, and
   qualitative/quantitative derivation of biota-environmental relationships
   for incorporation within stand-alone mechanistic models projecting
   ecological structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the relative performance of an experimental
   comparison of some well-known classification techniques such as
   classical statistical, artificial intelligence, mathematical programming
   (MP), and hybrid approaches. In particular, we examine the four-group,
   three-variable problem and the associated error rates for the four
   groups when each of the models is applied to various sets of simulated
   data. The data had varying characteristics such as multicollinearity,
   nonlinearity, sample proportions. etc. We concentrate on individual
   error rates for the four groups, i.e.. we count the number of group 1
   values classified into group 2, group 3, and group 4 and vice versa. The
   results indicate that in general not only are MP, k-NN, and hybrid
   approaches relatively better at overall classification but they also
   provide a much better balance between error rates for the top customer
   groups. The results also indicate that the MP and hybrid approaches
   provide relatively higher and stable classification accuracy under all
   the data characteristics. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Time is ubiquitous. Accounting for time and its interaction with change
   is crucial to modeling the dynamic world, especially in domains whose
   study of data is sensitive to time such as in medical diagnosis,
   financial investment, and natural language processing, to name a few. We
   present a framework that incorporates both uncertainty and time in its
   reasoning scheme. It is based on an existing knowledge representation
   called Bayesian Knowledge Bases. It provides a graphical representation
   of knowledge, time and uncertainty, and enables probabilistic and
   temporal inferencing. The reasoning scheme is probabilistically sound
   and the fusion of temporal fragments is well defined. We will discuss
   some properties of this framework and introduce algorithms to ensure
   groundedness during the construction of the model. The framework has
   been applied to both artificial and real world scenarios. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Data clustering is a popular data analysis technique needed in many
   fields. Recent years, some swarm intelligence-based approaches for
   clustering were proposed and achieved encouraging results. This paper
   presents a Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony (HABC) algorithm for data
   clustering. The incentive mechanism of HABC is enhancing the information
   exchange (social learning) between bees by introducing the crossover
   operator of Genetic Algorithm (GA) to ABC. With a test on ten benchmark
   functions, the proposed HABC algorithm is proved to have significant
   improvement over canonical ABC and several other comparison algorithms.
   The HABC algorithm is then employed for data clustering. Six real
   datasets selected from the UCI machine learning repository are used. The
   results show that the HABC algorithm achieved better results than other
   algorithms and is a competitive approach for data clustering. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Fertility rates have dramatically decreased in the last two decades,
   especially in men. It has been described that environmental factors, as
   well as life habits, may affect semen quality. Artificial intelligence
   techniques are now an emerging methodology as decision support systems
   in medicine.
   In this paper we compare three artificial intelligence techniques,
   decision trees, Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines, in
   order to evaluate their performance in the prediction of the seminal
   quality from the data of the environmental factors and lifestyle.
   To do that we collect data by a normalized questionnaire from young
   healthy volunteers and then, we use the results of a semen analysis to
   asses the accuracy in the prediction of the three classification methods
   mentioned above.
   The results show that Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines
   show the highest accuracy, with prediction accuracy values of 86\% for
   some of the seminal parameters. In contrast decision trees provide a
   visual and illustrative approach that can compensate the slightly lower
   accuracy obtained.
   In conclusion artificial intelligence methods are a useful tool in order
   to predict the seminal profile of an individual from the environmental
   factors and life habits. From the studied methods, Multilayer Perceptron
   and Support Vector Machines are the most accurate in the prediction.
   Therefore these tools, together with the visual help that decision trees
   offer, are the suggested methods to be included in the evaluation of the
   infertile patient. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we applied artificial intelligence techniques to improve

   First, we replace the conventional comparator and selection table

   learn the advantages of both methods; learning capacity of the first and
   readability and exibility of the second. This evaluation is obtained
   using the electromagnetic torque error, the error module and angle of
   the stator flux vector. Then we propose a new estimation method rotor
   speed using an adaptive neural observer. The error between the desired
   state variable and the actual state variable of a neural model is back
   propagated to adjust the weights of neural model, so that the actual
   state variable tracks the desired value. Finally, the proportional and

   the optimum performance of rotor speed. The simulation results show the

Abstract = {{Interturn short circuit is often confused with voltage imbalance in
   induction machines. Therefore, detection and classification of
   single-turn fault (TF) are becoming important in the presence of voltage
   imbalances, under various loading conditions. Substantial studies are
   conducted on the interturn fault detection, but a comprehensive method
   for classifying the faults at different operating points of the machine,
   under varying supply conditions, is still a challenge. This is a
   critical problem in industries since the induction motors form the major
   workhorses. The artificial-intelligence-based techniques are advanced
   methods in fault monitoring. This, when combined with optimization
   techniques, is expected to give improved and accurate results with
   minimum false alarms. In this paper, a technique is developed, based on
   recent developments in the wavelet-based analysis, particularly in the
   complex wavelet domain. The support vector machines are adopted for
   comparing the classification accuracy obtained using complex-wavelet-and
   standard discrete-wavelet-based methods. The receiver operating
   characteristic curves indicate that the fault detection, down to single
   turn, is feasible using a single current sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic fraud is highly lucrative, with estimates suggesting these
   crimes to be worth millions of dollars annually. Because of its complex
   nature, electronic fraud detection is typically impractical to solve
   without automation. However, the creation of automated systems to detect
   fraud is very difficult as adversaries readily adapt and change their
   fraudulent activities which are often lost in the magnitude of
   legitimate transactions. This study reviews the most popular types of
   electronic fraud and the existing nature-inspired detection methods that
   are used for them. The common characteristics of electronic fraud are
   examined in detail along with the difficulties and challenges that these
   present to computational intelligence systems. Finally, open questions
   and opportunities for further work, including a discussion of emerging
   types of electronic fraud, are presented to provide a context for
   ongoing research.}},

Abstract = {{The future of designing optical networks is focused on the wavelength
   division multiplexing (WDM) technology. This technology divides the huge
   bandwidth of an optical fiber into different wavelengths, providing
   different available channels per link of fiber. However, when it is
   necessary to establish a set of demands, a problem comes up. This
   problem is known as a routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem.
   Depending on the traffic pattern, two varieties of a RWA problem have
   been considered in the literature: static and dynamic. In this paper, we
   present a comparative study among three multiobjective evolutionary
   algorithms (MOEAs) based on swarm intelligence to solve the RWA problem
   in real-world optical networks. Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm,
   gravitational search algorithm (GSA), and firefly algorithm (FA) are the
   selected evolutionary algorithms, but are adapted to multiobjective
   domain (MO-ABC, MO-GSA, and MO-FA, respectively). In order to prove the
   goodness of the swarm proposals, we have compared them with a standard
   MOEA: fast nondominated sorting genetic algorithm. Finally, we present a
   comparison among the metaheuristics based on swarm intelligence and
   several techniques published in the literature, coming to the conclusion
   that swarm intelligence is very suitable to solve the RWA problem, and
   presumably that it may obtain such quality results not only in diverse
   telecommunication optimization problems, but also in other engineering
   optimization problems.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) consist of special kind of wireless
   mobile nodes which form a temporary network without using any
   infrastructure or centralized administration. MANETs can be used in wide
   range of future applications as they have the capability to establish
   networks at anytime, anywhere without aid of any established
   infrastructure. It is a challenging task to find most efficient routing
   due to the changing topology and the dynamic behavior of the nodes in
   MANET. It has been found that ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms
   can give better results as they are having characterization of Swarm
   Intelligence (SI) which is highly suitable for finding the adaptive
   routing for such type of volatile network. ACO algorithms are inspired
   by a foraging behavior of group of ants which are able to find optimal
   path based upon some defined metric which is evaluated during the motion
   of ants. ACO routing algorithms use simple agents called artificial ants
   which establish optimum paths between source and destination that
   communicate indirectly with each other by means of stigmergy. Keeping in
   view of the above, in this paper we provide a taxonomy of various ant
   colony algorithms with advantages and disadvantages of each others with
   respect to various metrics. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The development of SOA (service oriented architecture) applications is a
   paradigm to consider for the integration of services which usually
   requires the incorporation of distributed artificial intelligence
   technologies or multi agent systems (MAS) to achieve their objectives.
   This is the case of transportation field, where the improvement of urban
   data networks and embedded systems allow the implementation of complex
   distributed services based on intelligent transportation systems. One of
   the challenges of this kind of systems is the discovery of services.
   Typically, discovery of services lacks of intelligence, or the result of
   this process returns a lot of nonsense information. However, the field
   of transportation requires quick and accurate requests and answers to
   deal with emergencies or incidents in the traffic flow. For this
   purpose, this paper proposes the development of a specific service
   called semantic service (an ontology-based semantic communication
   service) developed in TAO (The ACE ORB) of CORBA (common object request
   broker architecture). This service is able to provide a communication
   support for distributed environment in conjunction with a set of base
   libraries like Redland (RDF language bindings) for interacting with
   ontologies written in RDF and RDFS format. A parser Raptor (RDF Syntax
   Library) is used for analyzing sequences of symbols to determine the
   grammatical structure, and a syntax query language, Rasqal (RDF Query
   Library) is used to build and execute queries. Both, Raptor and Rasqal
   were designed to work with the Redland library. The main objective is to
   manage ontological information and intemperate with implemented services
   in embedded urban devices. Obtained results demonstrate the feasibility
   and effectiveness of the proposed approach. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Artificial Intelligence models (AI) which computerize human reasoning
   has found a challenging test bed for various paradigms in many areas
   including financial time series prediction. Extensive researches have
   resulted in numerous financial applications using AI models. Since stock
   investment is a major investment activity. Lack of accurate information
   and comprehensive knowledge would result in some certain loss of
   investment. Hence, stock market prediction has always been a subject of
   interest for most investors and professional analysts. Stock market
   prediction is a challenging problem because uncertainties are always
   involved in the market movements. This paper proposes a hybrid
   intelligent model for stock exchange index prediction. The proposed
   model is a combination of data preprocessing methods, genetic algorithms
   and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm for learning feed forward neural
   networks. Actually it evolves neural network initial weights for tuning
   with LM algorithm by using genetic algorithm. We also use data
   pre-processing methods such as data transformation and input variables
   selection for improving the accuracy of the model. The capability of the
   proposed method is tested by applying it for predicting some stock
   exchange indices used in the literature. The results show that the
   proposed approach is able to cope with the fluctuations of stock market
   values and also yields good prediction accuracy. So it can be used to
   model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find data
   patterns while performing financial prediction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) systems incorporate learning and decision making
   into wireless and networking systems with the goal of improving
   performance and interoperability. Research has focused on artificial
   intelligence control and optimization of radio input parameters with
   little attention placed on identifying initialization parameters of
   cognitive engines or on testing methods. While CR techniques continue to
   advance, calibration and testing remain largely stagnant with reliance
   on ad hoc and highly application specific approaches. Given that
   cognitive radio will be deployed in a variety of environments with each
   requiring unique calibration, systematic procedures are needed. An
   approach founded in design of experiments provides a purposeful
   framework for performing testing and identification of initialization
   parameters with an efficient number of test cases. Response surface
   methodology designs identify representative knowledge of system
   performance including input parameter significance and quadratic
   estimation models of output metrics. An example of calibrating
   transmit-and-receive gain settings on a software-defined radio
   illustrates the use of the framework.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a new paradigm from the perspective of pervasive
   on-body computing through an innovative polymerized textile, which
   exhibits sensing and radiation properties. A radical, first of its kind,
   sensor fabricated from unsaturated polymer resin textile, establishes a
   dynamic link connecting human thermodynamics to electrical ambiance. A
   dynamic fabrication process of esterification and eta-polymerization is
   developed, which is articulately arrested using an innovatively
   formulated retardant, yielding a permanent thermally unstable partially
   oriented yarn (tuPOY). A prudently established nontrivial interchange
   phenomenon is founded, presenting an inimitable calibration mechanism of
   the sensors and charting a novel relationship of exuberated energy to
   lattice kinetics of tuPOY. This meticulously researched conducting
   medium of tuPOY, fabricated from aromatic polyamides, also presents an
   avant-garde architecture for proliferation of electrical and thermal
   signals concomitantly between the sensors and its transmission circuit.
   A power generating unit (PGU) delineates the power mining from thermal
   energy dissipated from the body, presenting a new dimension in
   operational power dynamics. A textile composite antenna is premeditated
   exclusively from radiating tuPOY-based patch and substrate, an archetype
   reporting in published literature. The judiciously designed antenna,
   with tuPOY coupled as its patch, and substrate operate as shields
   against the radiations directed towards the body leading to a
   self-sustained sculpt. The back-end hardware of the test setup
   conceptualizes an automated physician machine (APM) presenting a
   standalone architecture. The artificial intelligence core of APM is
   modeled on weighted multiclass support vector machines (wmSVMs). The
   capturing of signal variations, devoid of any metallic components,
   presents a singular facet of research and amalgamates various
   interdisciplinary fields, while providing a robust architecture with
   minimum tradeoffs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a cognitive radar (CR) that mimics the visual
   brain. Although the visual brain and radar are different in that the
   visual brain does not transmit a probing signal to the environment while
   the active radar greatly relies on the probing signal it transmits to
   the environment, both of them are observers of the surrounding
   environment. As such, there is much that we can learn from the visual
   brain in building a new generation of CRs that outperform traditional
   radars. In this paper, we confine the discussion, in both analytic and
   experimental terms, to CR aimed at target tracking. From a theoretical
   perspective, using the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB), it is
   shown that a cognitive tracking radar has the potential to improve
   tracking performance significantly. In particular, computer experiments
   are presented, which demonstrate that CR can indeed go beyond the
   theoretical limits of traditional active radars (TARs) as well as
   fore-active radars (FARs); the latter are radars equipped with feedback
   from the receiver to the transmitter. Moreover, computer experiments are
   presented to demonstrate another practical benefit resulting from the
   combined use of memory and executive attention in CR for a
   target-tracking application. Specifically, it is shown that with the
   provision of these two cognitive processes, the transition in switching
   from one transmit waveform to another goes forward in a smooth manner.
   Such a capability is beyond that of TAR or FAR.}},

Abstract = {{Flyrock is an undesirable phenomenon in the blasting operation of open
   pit mines. Flyrock danger zone should be taken into consideration
   because it is the major cause of considerable damage on the nearby
   structures. Even with the best care and competent personnel, flyrock may
   not be totally avoided. There are several empirical methods for
   prediction of flyrock phenomenon. Low performance of these models is due
   to complexity of flyrock analysis. Support vector machine (SVM) is a
   novel machine learning technique usually considered as a robust
   artificial intelligence method in classification and regression tasks.
   The aim of this paper is to test the capability of SVM for the
   prediction of flyrock in the Soungun copper mine, Iran. Comparing the
   obtained results of SVM with that of artificial neural network (ANN), it
   was concluded that SVM approach is faster and more precise than ANN
   method in predicting the flyrock of Soungun copper mine.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing complexity of contemporary embedded computing systems
   requires the use of self-management in order to handle unforeseen
   changes in both hardware and control software. The idea behind computer
   systems capable of self-management is a complex concept compound by many
   aspects related to both artificial intelligence and awareness. Here, the
   biggest challenge is still the question how to properly develop and
   verify such systems. In this paper, we present a formal approach to
   specifying embedded systems capable of self-management. In our approach,
   we use the ASSL (autonomic system specification language) framework as a
   development environment, where self-management features of embedded
   systems are specified and an implementation is automatically generated.
   ASSL exposes a rich set of specification constructs that help developers
   specify event-driven embedded systems. Hardware is sensed via special
   metrics intended to drive events and self-management policies that help
   the system handle critical situations in an autonomous reactive manner.
   We present this approach along with a simulation case study where ASSL
   is used to develop control software for the wide-angle camera carried on
   board NASA's Voyager II Spacecraft. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Obtaining high-quality and up-to-date labeled data can be difficult in
   many real-world machine learning applications. Semi-supervised learning
   aims to improve the performance of a classifier trained with limited
   number of labeled data by utilizing the unlabeled ones. This paper
   demonstrates a way to improve the transductive SVM, which is an existing
   semi-supervised learning algorithm, by employing a multiview learning
   paradigm. Multiview learning is based on the fact that for some
   problems, there may exist multiple perspectives, so called views, of
   each data sample. For example, in text classification, the typical view
   contains a large number of raw content features such as term frequency,
   while a second view may contain a small but highly informative number of
   domain specific features. We propose a novel two-view transductive SVM
   that takes advantage of both the abundant amount of unlabeled data and
   their multiple representations to improve classification result. The
   idea is straightforward: train a classifier on each of the two views of
   both labeled and unlabeled data, and impose a global constraint
   requiring each classifier to assign the same class label to each labeled
   and unlabeled sample. We also incorporate manifold regularization, a
   kind of graph-based semi-supervised learning method into our framework.
   The proposed two-view transductive SVM was evaluated on both synthetic
   and real-life data sets. Experimental results show that our algorithm
   performs up to 10 percent better than a single-view learning approach,
   especially when the amount of labeled data is small. The other advantage
   of our two-view semi-supervised learning approach is its significantly
   improved stability, which is especially useful when dealing with noisy
   data in real-world applications.}},

Abstract = {{Designing and operating two-sided assembly lines are crucial for
   manufacturing companies which assemble large-sized products such as
   trucks, buses and industrial refrigerators. This type of assembly line
   structure has several advantages over one-sided assembly lines such as
   shortened line length and reduced throughput time. The research area has
   recently focused on balancing two-sided assembly lines owing to these
   advantages. However, due to the complex structure of this problem, some
   practical constraints have been disregarded or have not been fully
   incorporated. In order to overcome these deficiencies, a fully
   constrained two-sided assembly line balancing problem is addressed in
   this research paper. Initially, a mathematical programming model is
   presented in order to describe the problem formally. Due to the problem
   complexity, two different swarm intelligence based search algorithms are
   implemented to solve large-sized instances. Bees algorithm and
   artificial bee colony algorithm have been applied to the fully
   constrained two-sided assembly line balancing problem so as to minimize
   the number of workstations and to obtain a balanced line. An extensive

Abstract = {{Swarm intelligence based automatic fuzzy clustering is recently an
   important and interesting unsupervised learning problem. In this
   article, an automatic fuzzy clustering technique is proposed based on a
   novel version of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm.
   The idea of variable length genotypes is introduced to the ABC, and a
   novel version of ABC, called Variable string length Artificial Bee
   Colony (VABC) algorithm, is proposed. The VABC algorithm is derived from
   the ABC by redefining or modifying some operations in the ABC: the fixed
   length strings are represented by using variable length strings, the
   scheme for producing candidate solutions is modified, and some mutation
   operations are introduced. Use of VABC allows the encoding of variable
   number of clusters. This makes the VABC based Fuzzy C-Means clustering
   technique (VABC-FCM) not require a priori specification of the number of
   clusters. Moreover, the VABC-FCM has powerful global search ability
   under rational parameter setting. Some artificial data sets and
   real-life data sets are applied to validate the performance of VABC-FCM.
   The experimental results show that VABC-FCM can automatically evolve the
   optimal number of clusters and find proper fuzzy partitioning for these
   data sets when a rational validity index is adopted. Finally, the
   performance of VABC-FCM is compared with those of the Variable string
   length Genetic Algorithm based Fuzzy C-Means clustering (VGA-FCM),
   Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm based Fuzzy C-Means clustering
   (PSO-FCM), and Differential Evolutional algorithm based Fuzzy C-Means
   clustering (DE-FCM). The results show that the VABC-FCM outperforms
   VGA-FCM, PSO-FCM and DE-FCM in most of the cases. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Stock price prediction is an important task for most investors and
   professional analysts. However, it is a tough problem because of the
   uncertainties involved in prices. This paper presents a four-layer fuzzy
   multiagent system (FMAS) architecture to develop a hybrid artificial
   intelligence model based on the coordination of intelligent agents
   performing data preprocessing and function approximation tasks for
   next-day stock price prediction. The first layer is dedicated to
   metadata creation. The second layer is aimed at data preprocessing using
   stepwise regression analysis and self-organizing map neural network
   clustering for modularizing prediction problems. The third layer is
   aimed at model building for each cluster using genetic fuzzy systems and
   evaluating built models to choose the best evolved fuzzy system for each
   cluster. Finally, the fourth layer provides model analysis and knowledge
   presentation. The capability of FMAS is evaluated by applying it on
   stock price data gathered from IT and airline sectors and comparing the
   outcomes with the results of other methods. The results show that FMAS
   outperforms all previous methods, so it can be considered as a suitable
   tool for stock price prediction problems. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Intelligent modeling, prediction and control of the braking process are
   not an easy task if using classical modeling techniques, regarding its
   complexity. In this paper, the new approach has been proposed for easy
   and effective monitoring, modeling, prediction, and control of the
   braking process i.e. the brake performance during a braking cycle. The
   context based control of the disc brake actuation pressure was used for
   improving the dynamic control of braking process versus influence of the
   previous and current values of the disc brake actuation pressure, the
   vehicle speed, and the brake interface temperature. For these purposes,
   two different dynamic neural models have been developed and integrated
   into the microcontroller. Microcontrollers are resource intensive and
   cost effective platforms that offer possibilities to associate with
   commonly used artificial intelligence techniques. The neural models,
   based on recurrent dynamic neural networks, are implemented in 8-bit
   CMOS microcontroller for control of the disc brake actuation pressure
   during a braking cycle. The first neural model was used for modeling and
   prediction of the braking process output (braking torque). Based on such
   acquired knowledge about the real brake operation, the inverse neural
   model has been developed which was able to predict the brake actuation
   pressure needed for achieving previously selected (desired) braking
   torque value in accordance with the previous and current influence of
   the pressure, speed, and the brake interface temperature. Both neural
   models have had inherent abilities for on-line learning and prediction
   during each braking cycle and an intelligent adaptation to the change of
   influences of pressure, speed, and temperature on the braking process.

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Information foraging and sense-making with heterogeneous information are
   context-dependent activities. Thus visual analytics tools to support
   these activities must incorporate context. But, context is a difficult
   concept to define, model, and represent. Creating and representing
   context in support of visually-enabled reasoning about complex problems
   with complex information is a complementary but different challenge than
   that addressed in context-aware computing. In the latter, the goal is
   automated system adaptation to meet user application needs such as
   location-based services where information about the location, the user,
   and user goals filters what gets presented on a small mobile device. In
   contrast, for visual analytics-enabled information foraging and
   sense-making, the user generally takes an active role in foraging for
   the contextual information needed to support sense-making in relation to
   some multifaceted problem. In this paper, we address the challenges of
   constructing and representing context within visual interfaces that
   support analytic reasoning in crisis management and humanitarian relief.
   The challenges stem from the diverse forms of information that can
   provide context and difficulty in defining and operationalizing context
   itself. Here, we focus on document foraging to support construction of
   geographic and historical context for facilitating monitoring and
   sense-making. Specifically, we present the concept of geo-historical
   context and outline an empirical assessment of both the concept and its
   implementation in the Context Discovery Application (CDA), a web-based
   tool that supports document foraging and sense-making. We also discuss
   the CDA's transition into applied use for the United Nations to
   demonstrate the generality of underlying CDA concepts.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the solution of multiobjective optimization problems in
   aeronautical and aerospace engineering has become a standard practice.
   These two fields offer highly complex search spaces with different
   sources of difficulty, which are amenable to the use of alternative
   search techniques such as metaheuristics, since they require little
   domain information to operate. From the several metaheuristics
   available, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become
   particularly popular, mainly because of their availability, ease of use,
   and flexibility. This paper presents a taxonomy and a comprehensive
   review of applications of MOEAs in aeronautical and aerospace design
   problems. The review includes both the characteristics of the specific
   MOEA adopted in each case, as well as the features of the problems being
   solved with them. The advantages and disadvantages of each type of
   approach are also briefly addressed. We also provide a set of general
   guidelines for using and designing MOEAs for aeronautical and aerospace
   engineering problems. In the final part of the paper, we provide some
   potential paths for future research, which we consider promising within
   this area.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that control systems are the core of electronic
   differential systems (EDSs) in electric vehicles (EVs)/hybrid HEVs
   (HEVs). However, conventional closed-loop control architectures do not
   completely match the needed ability to reject noises/disturbances,
   especially regarding the input acceleration signal incoming from the
   driver's commands, which makes the EDS (in this case) ineffective. Due
   to this, in this paper, a novel EDS control architecture is proposed to
   offer a new approach for the traction system that can be used with a
   great variety of controllers (e. g., classic, artificial intelligence
   (AI)-based, and modern/robust theory). In addition to this, a modified
   proportional-integral derivative (PID) controller, an AI-based
   neuro-fuzzy controller, and a robust optimal H-infinity controller were
   designed and evaluated to observe and evaluate the versatility of the
   novel architecture. Kinematic and dynamic models of the vehicle are
   briefly introduced. Then, simulated and experimental results were
   presented and discussed. A Hybrid Electric Vehicle in Low Scale
   (HELVIS)-Sim simulation environment was employed to the preliminary
   analysis of the proposed EDS architecture. Later, the EDS itself was
   embedded in a dSpace 1103 high-performance interface board so that
   real-time control of the rear wheels of the HELVIS platform was
   successfully achieved.}},

   satisfaction problems}},

Abstract = {{Constraint satisfaction problems (or CSPs) have been extensively studied
   in, for instance, artificial intelligence, database theory, graph
   theory, and statistical physics. From a practical viewpoint, it is
   beneficial to approximately solve those CSPs. When one tries to
   approximate the total number of truth assignments that satisfy all
   Boolean-valued constraints for (unweighted) Boolean CSPs, there is a
   known trichotomy theorem by which all such counting problems are neatly
   classified into exactly three categories under polynomial-time
   (randomized) approximation-preserving reductions. In contrast, we obtain
   a dichotomy theorem of approximate counting for complex-weighted Boolean
   CSPs, provided that all complex-valued unary constraints are freely
   available to use. It is the expressive power of free unary constraints
   that enables us to prove such a stronger, complete classification
   theorem. This discovery makes a step forward in the quest for the
   approximation-complexity classification of all counting CSPs. To deal
   with complex weights, we employ proof techniques of factorization and
   arity reduction along the line of solving Holant problems. Moreover, we
   introduce a novel notion of T-constructibility that naturally induces
   approximation-preserving reducibility. Our result also gives an
   approximation analogue of the dichotomy theorem on the complexity of
   exact counting for complex-weighted Boolean CSPs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Artificial DNA Computing-Based Spectral Encoding and Matching Algorithm
   for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{10, 2}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a spectral encoding and matching algorithm inspired by
   biological deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) computing is proposed to perform
   the task of spectral signature classification for hyperspectral remote
   sensing data. As a novel branch of computational intelligence, DNA
   computing has the strong computing and matching capability to
   discriminate the tiny differences in DNA strands by DNA encoding and
   matching in the molecule layer. Similar to DNA discrimination, a
   hyperspectral remote sensing data matching approach is used to recognize
   the land cover material from a spectral library or image, according to
   the rich spectral information. However, it is difficult to apply DNA
   computing to hyperspectral remote sensing data processing because
   traditional DNA computing often relies on biochemical reactions of DNA
   molecules and may result in incorrect or undesirable computations. To
   utilize the advantages and avoid the problems of biological DNA
   computing, an artificial DNA computing approach is proposed for spectral
   encoding and matching for hyperspectral remote sensing data. A DNA
   computing-based spectral matching approach is used to first transform
   spectral signatures into DNA codewords by capturing the key spectral
   features with a spectral feature encoding operation. After DNA encoding,
   the typical DNA database for interesting classes is constructed and
   saved by DNA evolutionary operating mechanisms such as crossover,
   mutation, and structured mutation. During the course of spectral
   matching, each pixel of the hyperspectral image, or each signature
   measured in the field, is input to the constructed DNA database. By
   computing the distance between an unclassified spectrum and the typical
   DNA codewords from the database, the class property of each pixel is set
   as the minimum distance class. Experiments using different hyperspectral
   data sets were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed
   artificial DNA computing-based spectral matching algorithm by comparing
   it with other traditional hyperspectral classifiers, including spectral
   matching classifiers (binary coding, spectral angle mapper and spectral
   derivative feature coding (SDFC) matching methods) and a novel
   statistical method of machine learning termed support vector machine
   (SVM). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is
   distinctly superior to the three traditional hyperspectral data
   classification algorithms. It presents excellent processing efficiency,
   compared to SVM, with high-dimensional data captured by the
   Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment sensor, and hence
   provides an effective option for spectral matching classification of
   hyperspectral remote sensing data.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) of the insulation oil of power transformers
   is an investigative tool to monitor their health and to detect impending
   failures by recognizing anomalous patterns of DGA concentrations. We
   handle the failure prediction problem as a simple data-mining task on
   DGA samples, optionally exploiting the transformer's age, nominal power
   and voltage, and consider two approaches: 1) binary classification and
   2) regression of the time to failure. We propose a simple logarithmic
   transform to preprocess DGA data in order to deal with long-tail
   distributions of concentrations. We have reviewed and evaluated 15
   standard statistical machine-learning algorithms on that task, and
   reported quantitative results on a small but published set of power
   transformers and on proprietary data from thousands of network
   transformers of a utility company. Our results confirm that nonlinear
   decision functions, such as neural networks, support vector machines
   with Gaussian kernels, or local linear regression can theoretically
   provide slightly better performance than linear classifiers or
   regressors. Software and part of the data are available at

Abstract = {{Text Classification is the task to classify documents into predefined
   classes. It has become one of the key techniques for organizing
   information. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, has
   been used in text classification with better performance than rule based
   ones. But they mostly need lots of training samples in the processing,
   which not only brings heavy work for previous data collection, but also
   require a higher storage and computing resources during the processing.
   Naive Bayes is one of the most efficient and effective inductive
   learning algorithms and can get more accurate result in the large
   training sample set. To improve the performance, feature selection
   mechanisms are incorporated into naive bayes algorithm. Firstly, feature
   extraction techniques are applied to remove irrelevant and redundant
   features. After that, naive bayes classification algorithm is used to
   text classification. The experimental results have shown that this
   method keeps high classification accuracy.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents different artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
   for crack identification in curvilinear beams based on changes in
   vibration characteristics. Vibration analysis has been performed by
   applying the finite element method (FEM) to compute natural frequencies
   and frequency response functions (FRFs) for intact and damaged beams.
   The analysis reveals the changes in natural frequencies and amplitudes
   of FRFs of the beams for cracks of different sizes at different
   locations. These changes are used as input data for single and multiple
   artificial neural networks (ANN) and multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy
   inference systems (ANFIS) in order to predict the size of the crack and
   its location. To avoid large models, the principal component analysis
   (PCA) approach has been carried out to reduce the computed FRFs data.
   The analysis of different techniques shows that the average prediction
   errors in the multiple ANN models is less than those in the single ANN
   model and in the multiple ANFIS. It is shown that the cracks longer than
   5 mm can be located with satisfactory accuracy, even if the input data
   are corrupted with various level of noise. Multiple ANFIS is adopted to
   construct a more reliable and less sensitive model for noise excitation.}},

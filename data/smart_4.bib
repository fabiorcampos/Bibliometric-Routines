Abstract = {{Device-free localization (DFL) is an emerging wireless technique for
   estimating the location of target that does not have any attached
   electronic device. It has found extensive use in Smart City applications
   such as healthcare at home and hospitals, location-based services at
   smart spaces, city emergency response and infrastructure security. In
   DFL, wireless devices are used as sensors that can sense the target by
   transmitting and receiving wireless signals collaboratively. Many DFL
   systems are implemented based on received signal strength (RSS)
   measurements and the location of the target is estimated by detecting
   the changes of the RSS measurements of the wireless links. Due to the
   uncertainty of the wireless channel, certain links may be seriously
   polluted and result in erroneous detection. In this paper, we propose a
   novel nonlinear optimization approach with outlier link rejection
   (NOOLR) for RSS-based DFL. It consists of three key strategies,
   including: (1) affected link identification by differential RSS
   detection; (2) outlier link rejection via geometrical positional
   relationship among links; (3) target location estimation by formulating
   and solving a nonlinear optimization problem. Experimental results
   demonstrate that NOOLR is robust to the fluctuation of the wireless
   signals with superior localization accuracy compared with the existing
   Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI) approach.}},

Abstract = {{The prevention of accidents is one of the most important goals of ad hoc
   networks in smart cities. When an accident happens, dynamic sensors
   (e.g., citizens with smart phones or tablets, smart vehicles and buses,
   etc.) could shoot a video clip of the accident and send it through the
   ad hoc network. With a video message, the level of seriousness of the
   accident could be much better evaluated by the authorities (e.g., health
   care units, police and ambulance drivers) rather than with just a simple
   text message. Besides, other citizens would be rapidly aware of the
   incident. In this way, smart dynamic sensors could participate in
   reporting a situation in the city using the ad hoc network so it would
   be possible to have a quick reaction warning citizens and emergency
   units. The deployment of an efficient routing protocol to manage
   video-warning messages in mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) has important
   benefits by allowing a fast warning of the incident, which potentially
   can save lives. To contribute with this goal, we propose a multipath
   routing protocol to provide video-warning messages in MANETs using a
   novel game-theoretical approach. As a base for our work, we start from
   our previous work, where a 2-players game-theoretical routing protocol
   was proposed to provide video-streaming services over MANETs. In this
   article, we further generalize the analysis made for a general number of
   N players in the MANET. Simulations have been carried out to show the
   benefits of our proposal, taking into account the mobility of the nodes
   and the presence of interfering traffic.Finally, we also have tested our
   approach in a vehicular ad hoc network as an incipient start point to
   develop a novel proposal specifically designed for VANETs.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays one of the hottest theme is the application of the newest
   technologies in road safety. Several proposals have been made and both
   US and European standardization institutes are working on them. In this
   work we present a novel cooperative architecture that allows vehicles to
   communicate between them exploiting Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle
   to Infrastructure (V2I) connections. In order to spread information we
   propose a network protocol called Safety Enhancement for WAVE based
   protocol (SeAWave) that takes advantages of IEEE802.11p standard and
   tries to enhance it adding useful messages increasing vehicles' passive
   and active safety systems. In this work we propose a novel protocol in
   order to gather important data about environment such as collisions,
   block, emission levels and so on. These data are collected by the City
   Traffic Manager (CTM) exploiting dedicated messages sent by the vehicle
   and infrastructure devices. They are used by the system to activate
   alerting mechanism using protocol messages in a controlled broadcasting.
   In addiction, CTM knowing the whole status of the road network can avoid
   traffic blocks making some high level decisions. Also a smart traffic
   management system is addressed in the proposed framework in order to
   reduce vehicles' C O (2) emissions in the urban area increasing, where
   possible, air quality. In order to validate proposed framework and
   protocol we use a well know Discrete-Event Simulator (DES) simulator
   with a dynamic mobility generator that allow us to change and control
   reference areas, area size, and loads rate.}},

Abstract = {{Deploying 5G technologies in a combination of smart homes and smart city
   opens for a new ecosystem with big potentials. The potentials lie in the
   creation of an advanced ICT infrastructure with support for connected
   and entangled services possibilities including technologies for
   efficient communication in an Internet of Things (5G) contexts. In this
   paper we discuss some of the key challenges that exist in the smart city
   and smart home networks in the light of possible 5G-solutions. Focus is
   on deploying cognitive radio technologies (5G) which enables the smart
   city networks to support interconnected infrastructure elements, to
   handle big-data from the smart homes, and to be compatible with existing
   infrastructures. The considered cognitive radio technology is based on
   pre-coded OFDM which offers the needed flexibility to deal with the key
   challenges found in the smart home networks. Thus, it is able to
   overcome the WiFi interferences and the wall penetration losses for a
   limited power cost. By simulation it has been found that power saving in
   the range of 10-23 \% can be achieved for a small bandwidth cost.
   Additionally, it has been found that the choice of the smart home
   gateway location can change its power consumption with 99 \%. The
   developed simulator incorporates interferences, wall losses, and packet
   error rates, which is elaborated in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial building microgrids will play an important role in the smart

   activities, which may cause performance degradations and overloads, have
   put great stress on the distribution system. In order to improve the
   self-consumption of PV energy and reduce the impact on the power grid, a
   heuristic operation strategy for commercial building microgrids is
   proposed. The strategy is composed of three parts: the model of EV
   feasible charging region, the mechanism of dynamical event triggering,
   and the algorithm of real-time power allocation for EVs. Furthermore, in
   order to lower the cost of computation resource, the strategy is
   designed to operate without forecasting on photovoltaic output or EV
   charging demand. A comprehensive result obtained from simulation tests
   has shown that the proposed strategy has both satisfactory results and
   high efficiency, which can be utilized in embedded systems for real-time

   MethodologySeventy-five extracted human maxillary incisors were selected
   and randomly assigned to 5 groups (n=15). The root canals were irrigated
   with Vibringe (Vibringe B. V. Corp, Amsterdam, Netherlands), EndoVac
   (Discus Dental, Smart Endodontics, Culver City, CA, USA), nonactivated
   SAF (ReDent-Nova, Ra'anana, Israel), passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI)
   and conventional syringe. Distilled water was used as an irrigant, and
   debris was collected in pre-weighed glass vials. The tubes were then
   stored in an incubator at 37 degrees C for 10days to evaporate the
   irrigant before weighing the dry debris. The mean weight of debris was
   assessed, and one-way analysis of variance was used for comparison of
   values and post hoc Tukey's test was used between groups (P=0.05).
   ResultsThe SAF group extruded significantly less debris than PUI and
   Vibringe groups (P<0.05). There were no significant difference between
   needle, Vibringe and EndoVac groups (P>0.05).
   ConclusionsAll irrigation systems were associated with apical extrusion
   of debris. Nonactivated SAF extruded significantly less than Vibringe,
   EndoVac, passive ultrasonic and syringe irrigation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an efficient architecture of a smart public safety
   platform that involves public professional operators as well as
   citizens. The proposed system is compliant with the emerging paradigm of
   a smart city. Its main features are that of monitoring, forecasting and
   managing emergency situations, arising from environmental disasters or
   crimes. The proposed platform performs a smart and functional
   integration of heterogeneous components as a smart data gathering and
   analysis system, a novel professional communication system, wireless
   sensor networks and social networks. Each element acts not only as an
   information collector but has autonomous capabilities to cooperate with
   the others in order to increase the system efficiency and to reduce the
   need of human interactions. Finally, the paper highlights some open
   research issues that represent critical aspects and require additional
   investigations in order to further improve the performance of the
   proposed platform. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The Anthropocene-the geological epoch in which human activities are
   signaled in Earth's geological records-often appears as an age to be met
   with grim resignation. Anxiety-driven narratives about this era can
   translate into very material landscapes of surveillance, tightened
   borders, farmland acquisitions, and so on, landscapes where speculation
   shapes lived realities. This article proposes that instead of joining
   the chorus of dark predictions, or rejecting the flawed concept
   altogether, geographers are well positioned to experiment with
   articulating a different Anthropocene. Fragments of a beautiful
   Anthropocene are already under design: agroecology, green roofs and
   buildings, distributed renewable energy systems. Yet to weave together a
   vision compelling enough to provoke cultural and political change, other
   elements are necessary: a reawakened sense of wonder, an ethic of care,
   and aesthetic and cultural production around these. This article
   proposes enchantment as a concept to evoke these elements and discusses
   the merits and dangers of imagining an enchanted Anthropocene. It looks
   at emergent alternative framings for thinking about a human-shaped earth
   and examples of related practices-rewilding, biophilic cities, planetary
   gardening, smart landscapes-which could make for a more habitable and
   welcoming epoch.}},

Abstract = {{Promoting cycling and building bike lanes would seem to be an
   uncontroversial way for progressive mayors to build up their `green' and
   `smart city' reputations. After all, cycling promotes health, reduces
   traffic and fights global warming. Yet, surprisingly, it was former
   Washington DC Mayor Adrian Fenty's enthusiasm for building bike lanes
   that, at least in part, brought his once-promising political career to a
   sudden end in 2010. Drawing on a synthesis of Bourdieu's field theory
   and Stuart Hall's concept of articulation, this article offers a case
   study of cycling and class politics in Washington DC. In particular,
   this article examines how, during the 2010 Mayoral election, cycling
   became articulated with wider struggles over gentrification and race. A
   concluding section draws on the case to argue that Hall's concept of
   articulation offers a useful corrective for the subtle bias toward
   social reproduction in Bourdieu's theory of social fields.}},

Abstract = {{We are approaching the tipping point in the development of technologies
   that promise to enable an era of smart everything (cities, cars,
   buildings, etc.). Concurrently, service systems continue to dominate
   industrialized economies. Naturally, the concepts of smartness and
   service are starting to fuse, particularly when there is growing
   interest in overcoming the issues surrounding the effective
   implementation of smart engineered systems by applying a ``service{''}
   framework. In terms of adding value to human life, actions executed by
   smart objects, mediated by technology, can be interpreted as a service
   to people. Inevitably, a new theoretical framework is needed to describe
   the interactions of ubiquitous technologies (new smart objects or
   processes) with the human world. Fundamental scientific principles need
   to be well understood at the intersection of the sensing and actuating,
   cognitive/behavioral, communications, and computational fields. This
   call for a new research avenue is intended to challenge the service
   engineering research community to think more deeply in the context above
   and converge with behavioral, cognitive, and computer scientists to
   develop new or additional principles and theories that help us better
   predict the behavior of a service system as a function of its design (as

Abstract = {{Turning grand concepts such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart
   Cities into reality requires the development and deployment of a wide
   variety of computing devices incorporated into the Internet
   infrastructure. Unsupervised sensing is the cornerstone capability that
   these devices must have to perform useful functions, while also having
   low cost of acquisition and ownership, little energy c onsumption and a
   small footprint. Impedimetric sensing systems based on the so-called
   single-frequency DFT detectors possess many of these desirable
   attributes and are often introduced in remote monitoring and wearable
   devices. This study presents new methods of improving performance of
   such detectors. It demonstrates that the main source of systematic
   errors is the discontinuous test phasor causing the crosstalk between
   the in-phase and quadrature outputs and the leakage of the input signal.
   The study derives expressions for these errors as a function of the
   number of samples and operating frequency, and provides methods for
   correction. The proposed methods are applied to the operation of a
   practical device-a network analyzer integrated circuit AD5933-and
   discussed in detail. These methods achieve complete elimination of
   leakage errors and expansion of the low limit of the operation frequency
   range by nearly two decades without additional hardware.}},

   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)-based sensor authentication
   protocol is proposed that enables light-weight sensor authentication and
   key generation. Secondly, a mechanism for handoffs between wireless
   sensor gateways is proposed. We validate both mechanisms in a real-life
   study that was conducted in a smart city environment with several fixed
   sensors and moving gateways. We conduct similar experiments in an
   industry-based anechoic Long Term Evolution (LTE) chamber with an ideal
   radio environment. Further, we validate our results collected from the
   smart city environment against the results produced under ideal
   conditions to establish best and real-life case scenarios. Our results
   clearly validate that our proposed mechanisms can facilitate efficient

Abstract = {{The need for constant monitoring of environmental conditions has
   produced an increase in the development of wireless sensor networks
   (WSN). The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart
   sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This,
   combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase
   in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor
   networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol
   (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the
   Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of
   Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a
   lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into
   interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or
   even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network.
   This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the
   principles of the Internet of Things and the Web of Things. Wireless
   sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and
   communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open
   Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used
   as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental
   WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof
   of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding
   energy concerns are presented.}},

Title = {{Destinations matter: The association between where older adults live and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT \& HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{50-57}},

Abstract = {{The positive effect of physical activity in the prevention and treatment
   of many chronic diseases and age-related disabilities, such as
   mobility-disability, are widely accepted. Mobility is broadly defined as
   the ability of individuals to move themselves within community
   environments. These two concepts physical activity and mobility - are
   closely linked and together contribute to older adults living healthy,
   independent lives. Neighborhood destinations may encourage mobility, as
   older adults typically leave their homes to travel to specific
   destinations. Thus, neighborhoods with a high prevalence of destinations
   may provide older adults an attractive opportunity to walk, instead of
   drive, and thereby obtain incidental physical activity. We know
   surprisingly little about the specific types of destinations older
   adults deem relevant and even less about destinations that support the
   mobility of older adults with low income. Accessible neighborhood
   destinations may be especially important to older adults with low income
   as they are more likely to walk as a primary travel mode. Conversely,
   this population may also be at increased risk of functional impairments
   that negatively affect their ability to walk. As a means to fill this
   information gap we aimed to better understand the mobility habits of
   older adults with low income. Thus, our specific objectives were to: (1)
   describe the types of destinations older adults with low income most
   commonly travel to in one week; and (2) determine the association
   between the prevalence of neighborhood destinations and the number of
   transportation walking trips these individuals make (average per day).
   We conducted a cross-sectional study of community-dwelling older adults
   with low income residing within Metro Vancouver, Canada. We assessed
   participant travel behavior (frequency, purpose, mode, destination)
   using seven-day travel diaries and measured the prevalence of
   neighborhood destinations using the Street Smart Walk Score. We also
   assessed participants' sociodemographic characteristics and mobility
   (physical function, car access, confidence walking). We used a negative
   binomial model to determine the association between Street Smart Walk
   Score and number of transportation walking trips (average per day). Our
   sample was comprised of 150 participants (median age 74 years; 51 men)
   from who we acquired at least one day of travel diary data (range = 1-7
   days). Participants made three trips per day (2, 5; median P-25, P-75)
   and travelled to six different destination types per week (5, 9; median
   P-25, P-75). Destinations most relevant to older adults were grocery
   stores, malls, and restaurants/cafes. Each 10-point increase in Street
   Smart Walk Score was associated with a 20\% increase in the number of
   transportation walking trips (average per day, incidence rate ratio =
   1.20, 95\% CI = 1.12, 1.29). Our findings provide preliminary evidence
   regarding destinations that may be most relevant to older adults. They
   also suggest that the prevalence of these neighborhood destinations may
   encourage walking. As we approach a new era of healthy city benchmarks,
   our findings guide policy makers and developers to retrofit and develop
   communities that support the mobility, health, and independence of older
   adults. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Through a closer analysis of cases in Louisville and Philadelphia, we
   demonstrate the utility of understanding the material effects of these

   how and from where these policies have arisen, and how they have
   unevenly impacted the places that have adopted them.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by the profit motive of global high-technology companies, in

   towards corporate and entrepreneurial governance versions. A second form
   of intervention concerns considering smartness from different
   perspectives emanating from small-scale and fledgling examples of
   participatory and citizen-based types of smart initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{This article makes three related arguments. First, that although many
   definitions of the smart city have been proposed, corporate promoters
   say a smart city uses information technology to pursue efficient systems
   through real-time monitoring and control. Second, this definition is not
   new and equivalent to the idea of urban cybernetics debated in the
   1970s. Third, drawing on a discussion of Rio de Janeiro's Operations
   Center, I argue that viewing urban problems as wicked problems allows
   for more fundamental solutions than urban cybernetics, but requires
   local innovation and stakeholder participation. Therefore the last
   section describes institutions for municipal innovation and IT-enabled
   collaborative planning.}},

   argue that much of the writing and rhetoric about smart cities seeks to
   appear non-ideological, commonsensical and pragmatic. More critically

   interventions, presently has four shortcomings that inhibit making sense
   of and refashioning the smart city agenda: the lack of detailed
   genealogies of the concept and initiatives, the use of canonical
   examples and one-size fits all narratives, an absence of in-depth
   empirical case studies of specific smart city initiatives and
   comparative research that contrasts smart city developments in different
   locales and weak collaborative engagement with various stakeholders.
   These shortcomings are elaborated, accompanied with suggestions for
   addressing them.}},

Abstract = {{Smart cities have become a reality around the world. They rely on
   wireless communication technologies, and they have provided many
   benefits to society, such as monitoring road traffic in real-time,
   giving continuous healthcare assistance to residents and managing the
   environment. This article revisits key interoperability questions in
   heterogeneous wireless networks for smart cities, and outlines a simple,
   modular architecture to deal with these complex issues. The architecture
   is composed by sensing, access network, Internet/cloud and application
   layers. Different features provided by the architecture, such as
   interoperability among technologies, low cost, reliability and security,
   have been evaluated through experiments and simulations under different
   scenarios. The QoS support and the seamless connectivity between pairs
   of heterogeneous technologies are proposed through a policy-based
   management (PBM) framework and MIH (Media Independent Handover).
   Moreover, an 802.11 mesh backbone composed of different types of mesh
   routers has been deployed for interconnecting the sensors and actuators
   to the Internet. Key results from experiments in the backbone are
   examined. They compare: (i) the performance of a single-path routing
   protocol (OLSR) with a multipath one (MP-OLSR); (ii) the monitoring
   delays from the proposed low cost sunspot/mesh and arduino/mesh
   gateways; and (iii) the authentication mechanisms employed. Significant
   results from simulations allow the analysis of the reliability on
   vehicular/mesh networks under jamming attacks by applying the OLSR and
   MP-OLSR routing protocols. Finally, this article provides an overview of
   open research questions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) will play an important role in Smart
   Cities and will support the development of not only safety applications,
   but also car smart video surveillance services. Recent improvements in
   multimedia over VANETs allow drivers, passengers, and rescue teams to
   capture, share, and access on-road multimedia services. Vehicles can
   cooperate with each other to transmit live flows of traffic accidents or
   disasters and provide drivers, passengers, and rescue teams rich visual
   information about a monitored area. Since humans will watch the videos,
   their distribution must be done by considering the provided Quality of
   Experience (QoE) even in multi-hop, multi-path, and dynamic
   environments. This article introduces an application framework to handle
   this kind of services and a routing protocol, the DBD (Distributed
   Beaconless Dissemination), that enhances the dissemination of live video
   flows on multimedia highway VANETs. DBD uses a backbone-based approach
   to create and maintain persistent and high quality routes during the
   video delivery in opportunistic Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) scenarios. It
   also improves the performance of the IEEE 802.11p MAC layer, by solving
   the Spurious Forwarding (SF) problem, while increasing the packet
   delivery ratio and reducing the forwarding delay. Performance evaluation
   results show the benefits of DBD compared to existing works in
   forwarding videos over VANETs, where main objective and subjective QoE
   results are measured. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Home networks currently dominated by human-object or human-human
   information production, exchange, processing, and paradigms are
   transitioning to machine to machine (M2M) due to the sudden introduction
   of embedded devices. Recently, due to the spread of IT equipment, more
   M2M-related devices are being used, and M2M-based projects are underway
   in various fields such as M2M-based u-city, u-port, u-work, u-traffic,
   etc. M2M has been applied in various fields, and u-healthcare is
   attracting attention in the M2M medical field. U-healthcare refers to
   technology in which ordinary patients can receive prescription services
   from experts by continuously monitoring changes in their health status
   during daily life at home based on wired and wireless communications
   infrastructures. In this paper, we propose an M2M-based smart health
   service for human UI/UX using motion recognition. Non-IP protocol, not
   TCP/IP protocol, has been used in sensor networks applied to M2M-based
   u-healthcare. However, sensors should be connected to the Internet in
   order to expand the use of services and facilitate management of the
   M2M-based sensor network. Therefore, we designed an M2M-based smart
   health service considering network mobility since data measured by the
   sensors should be transferred over the Internet. Unlike existing
   healthcare platforms, M2M-based smart health services have been
   developed for motion recognition as well as bio-information. Smart
   health services for motion recognition can sense four kinds of emotions,
   anger, sadness, neutrality, and joy, as well as stress using sensors.
   Further, they can measure the state of the individual by recognizing a
   user's respiratory and heart rates using an ECG sensor. In the existing
   medical environment, most medical information systems managing patient
   data use a centralized server structure. Using a fixed network, it is
   easy to collect and process limited data, but there are limits to
   processing a large amount of data collected from M2M devices in
   real-time. Generally, M2M communication used in u-healthcare consists of
   many networked devices and gateways. An M2M network may use standardized
   wireless technology based on the requirements of a particular device.
   Network mobility occurs when the connecting point changes according to
   the movement of any network, and the terminal can be connected without
   changing its address. If the terminal within the network communicates
   with any corresponding node, communication between the terminal and
   corresponding node should be continuously serviced without
   discontinuation. The method proposed in this paper can easily respond to
   dynamic changes in the wireless environment and conduct systematic
   management based on user's motion recognition using technology to
   support mobility among sensor nodes in M2M.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Studies have shown minimal impact by smart irrigation controllers when
   installed indiscriminately, but targeting overirrigators increases the
   water conservation potential. The objective was to evaluate different
   methodologies defining residential overirrigators. Two independent smart
   controller studies were conducted by utilities in Hillsborough County
   {[}Hillsborough County Water Resource Services (HCWRS)] and Orange
   County {[}Orange County Utilities (OCU)], Florida. In HCWRS, the
   cooperators qualified when irrigation was in the top 50th percentile of
   potable water users in the county. Additionally, the 21 cooperators were
   located in three cities determined as having high water use relative to
   other cities in the same area. In OCU, 132 cooperators received smart
   controllers when frequently irrigating more than 1.5 times the gross
   irrigation requirement (GIR). Actual ratios of historical average
   irrigation to the GIR ranged from 1.45 to 2.37 in HCWRS and 6.04-8.33 in
   OCU. As a result, cooperators in OCU showed significant reductions in
   irrigation with a return on investment of 4-14 months compared to HCWRS
   with a payback period of 17-27 months despite higher water rates and
   larger irrigated areas in HCWRS. Using the GIR as a benchmark proved to
   be a better method than using utility-wide percentile ranges of
   irrigation application to target homeowners for smart controllers to
   ensure irrigation reductions. Smart controllers are recommended for
   homeowners who average two times the monthly GIR for at least three
   months per year over at least three years when implemented in
   conjunction with relatively well-maintained irrigation systems. Water
   savings were guaranteed when ratios averaged more than six using the
   same frequency standards. Additional requirements for successful
   implementation include site-specific programming and providing basic
   knowledge to the homeowner. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) as an emerging network paradigm is bringing
   the next scientific and technological revolution for ubiquitous things'
   interactions in cyber-physical-social spaces. The IoT influences the
   current science and technology system by enabling its relatively stable
   interrelations for an inevitable architecture reconfiguration. In this
   paper, we aim to explore an updated science and technology framework for
   the IoT. Particularly, a novel cyber-physical-social-thinking (CPST)
   space is established by involving an attractive concept of the Internet
   of Thinking (IoTk), and a science and technology framework is
   accordingly proposed referring to both scientific aspect (i.e.,
   cyber-physical, social, and noetic sciences) and technological aspect
   (i.e., fundamental, physical, cyber, and social technologies). According
   to the perspective of the traditional Chinese culture, we explain the
   established science and technology framework, in which the ``Five
   Elements{''} (i.e., wood, fire, earth, metal, and water) have common
   properties with the restructured cyber-physical science in the IoT.
   Moreover, we introduce a scenario of smart city to identify the
   technological aspect in the IoT, and discuss the key enabling
   technologies, including resource management, energy management, data
   management, session management, security and privacy, loop control,
   space-time consistency, nanotechnology, and quantum technology. It turns
   out that the established science and technology framework will launch an
   innovation for academia and industry communities.}},

Abstract = {{Hyderabad is the second largest metropolitan region in India. The advent
   of globalization in India has opened the door for Hyderabad to brand
   itself as the popular destination for high-tech industries. In 1999, the
   entrepreneurial state government initiated Andhra Pradesh Vision 2020, a
   strategic document to develop the state by attracting foreign direct
   investments and developing specific growth engines in order to leapfrog
   toward the information society. Hyderabad was chosen to be the spine of
   the state governments' visioning strategies and efforts have been made
   to brand it as the `world-class' high-tech hub of India. Since then,
   Hyderabad has been under massive urban restructuring. This profile
   provides an overview of the origins and history of Hyderabad, the
   changing political economy of the state and resultant urban
   restructuring and followed by an exploration of emerging urban
   challenges and socio-spatial complexities of the expanding metro. (C)

Abstract = {{Distribution systems have undergone a strong evolution in the last few
   years. An important cause of this evolution is the growing presence of
   dispersed generation; the increasing levels of quality of service
   required by final users are another important issue for Distribution
   System Operators. These driving forces are particularly challenging in
   Italy: on the one hand, recent incentives have fostered the installation
   of many Dispersed Generation units on MV networks; on the other hand,
   the quality of service regulations put in place by the Italian Energy
   Regulator push Distribution System Operators to exploit automation on
   distribution grids. Within this framework, the paper describes a
   practical implementation of the smart grid concept to a real-life MV
   network in the urban area of Milan, developed by A2A Reti Elettriche
   (which owns and operates the distribution network in the cities of Milan
   and Brescia) in the context of smart grid demonstration projects
   launched by the Italian Energy Regulator in 2010. After a brief
   illustration of the network adopted for the experiment, the smart grid
   architecture is presented, along with the main functionalities to be
   achieved. Particular attention is devoted to an innovative automatic
   procedure for selective fault detection, based on logic selectivity and
   fast network reconfiguration. Some remarks are also provided about the
   performances of telecommunication supports used for the project. (C)

Abstract = {{Smart cities are now arguably the new urban utopias of the 21st century.
   Integrating urban and digital planning, smart cities are being marketed
   across the world as solutions to the challenges of urbanization and
   sustainable development. In India, in particular, there has been a move
   towards building 100 new smart cities in the future in order to spur
   economic growth and urbanization. Using the case of Dholera, the first
   Indian smart city, I examine how global models of smart cities are
   provincialized in the regional state of Gujarat through local histories,
   politics and laws. First, I argue that Dholera smart city is part of a
   longer genealogy of utopian urban planning that emerged as a response to
   the challenges of development and modernity in post-independent India.
   Second, that Dholera highlights a shift towards an `entrepreneurial
   urbanization' in a regional state interested in scaling up a `Gujarat
   model of development' for emulation at the scale of the nation. Finally,
   that in Dholera `speed' is a relative term across its scales of
   manifestation from the global to local, where short `bursts of speed' in
   conceptualization and investment is matched by significant
   `bottle-necks' via local protests. The article concludes that Dholera's
   fault lines are built into its utopian imaginings, which prioritizes
   urbanization as a business model rather than a model of social justice.}},

Abstract = {{India's smart city plans have much in common with `high-tech' and
   `intelligent' city developments elsewhere. Among the similarities with
   the Multimedia Super Corridor in Malaysia in the 1990s is the role of
   seductive language and technologically utopian imaginings of the future
   in legitimizing land acquisition and dispossession. Geographers need to
   continue to look critically at smart city discourse and its inequitable
   socio-spatial effects. It is also important, however, that geographers
   consider possibilities for more progressive smart technology-enabled
   futures. The case of Malaysia shows not only that the implementation of
   smart and intelligent city projects faces resistance but also that
   socio-technical outcomes tend to exceed the plans of corporate and
   political interests.}},

Abstract = {{In my response to the commentaries on my anchor article, I have taken on
   board the key question of how and why India has become the site of
   production of 100 proposed smart cities. I forward a notion of
   `technocratic nationalism' to suggest that it is the young urban
   population in India who have largely bought into the smart city dream.
   Whilst drawing encouragement from the largely positive commentaries on
   my article, I then take on three main critiques of the article - first,
   that it has inadvertently promoted a hegemony of `city-ness' by focusing
   on the imagined smart city to be; second, that the smart city has strong
   connections with colonial urban planning and third, whether Dholera
   should be considered the first smart city at all. I suggest that the
   article's city-ness and postcolonial links to India's urban planning is
   both political and heuristic, since it is the postcolonial `urban'
   moment where India has situated its moment of modernity globalization
   and economic power. I contend that the final critique is based on a
   misinterpretation of the use of the word `first', which was always
   intended to reflect a politics of innovation among cities. Finally, I
   suggest that the other `gaps' in my article highlighted by one of the
   commentators is not a gap, rather beyond the scope and objectives of an
   exploratory article such as this.}},

Abstract = {{A limited number of studies have addressed residential self-selection
   when considering the relationship between the built environment (BE) and
   physical activity. Ignoring self-selection may bias the estimate of the
   strength of the relationship and misinform public policy. Using 2011
   data from the Twin Cities, this study employs cross-sectional and
   quasi-longitudinal analyses to disentangle the impacts between
   self-selection (through residential preferences and travel attitudes)
   and neighborhood characteristics on active travel (AT). The two
   approaches produce somewhat different outcomes: attitudinal factors are
   extensively present in the cross-sectional analysis and the associations
   between neighborhood characteristics and AT are greatly attenuated after
   controlling for attitudinal factors. In contrast, neighborhood
   characteristics play a dominant role in the quasi-longitudinal analysis,
   while attitudinal and demographic characteristics carry additional
   impacts on AT. Overall, both preferences and attitudes help explain the
   difference in AT. I find that while physical activity infrastructure
   impacts biking, physical activity infrastructure together with transit
   and accessibility affects walking, even after controlling for
   demographic and attitudinal characteristics. The results highlight the
   importance of shaping the BE in order to provide an infrastructure of
   alternative modes of transport and access to different land uses in
   policy efforts to increase AT.}},

   Simulations}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{2265-2282}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Most simulation-based noise maps are important for official noise
   assessment but lack local noise characteristics. The main reasons for
   this lack of information are that official noise simulations only
   provide information about expected noise levels, which is limited by the
   use of large-scale monitoring of noise sources, and are updated
   infrequently. With the emergence of smart cities and ubiquitous sensing,
   the possible improvements enabled by sensing technologies provide the
   possibility to resolve this problem. This study proposed an integrated
   methodology to propel participatory sensing from its current random and
   distributed sampling origins to professional noise simulation. The aims
   of this study were to effectively organize the participatory noise data,
   to dynamically refine the granularity of the noise features on road
   segments (e.g., different portions of a road segment), and then to
   provide a reasonable spatio-temporal data foundation to support noise
   simulations, which can be of help to researchers in understanding how
   participatory sensing can play a role in smart cities. This study first
   discusses the potential limitations of the current participatory sensing
   and simulation-based official noise maps. Next, we explain how
   participatory noise data can contribute to a simulation-based noise map
   by providing (1) spatial matching of the participatory noise data to the
   virtual partitions at a more microscopic level of road networks; (2)
   multi-temporal scale noise estimations at the spatial level of virtual
   partitions; and (3) dynamic aggregation of virtual partitions by
   comparing the noise values at the relevant temporal scale to form a
   dynamic segmentation of each road segment to support multiple
   spatio-temporal noise simulations. In this case study, we demonstrate
   how this method could play a significant role in a simulation-based
   noise map. Together, these results demonstrate the potential benefits of
   participatory noise data as dynamic input sources for noise simulations
   on multiple spatio-temporal scales.}},

Abstract = {{To face the challenges of urbanization and climate change in Morocco,
   within the initiative of the Department of Water, we started working
   recently on the development of rainwater harvesting (RWH). The Bouskoura
   basin is the pilot site selected, because an integrated water resources
   management (IWRM) approach may be considered due to rapid urbanization
   and industrialization, and hosting wide facilities such as airport,
   highway, many expanding urban areas promotion and including 64\% of
   rural areas. Hydrological modeling was carried out through HEC-HMS model
   for the reconstitution of theoretical natural hydrograph because of the
   lack of hydrological measurements and STORM model to study the
   integrated effect of the water harvesting facilities on the
   socio-economic and environmental aspects of the basin and its
   relationships with its environment. Continuous simulations are made
   based on data from climate models re analysis because of the lack of
   ground measured climate data. Modeling was used to measure the impact of
   storm-water on the environment in general and on the hydrological cycle
   in particular including mitigation of flood magnitudes, the substantial
   drinking water costs reduction, the impact obtained from watering green
   spaces, the artificial recharge of the aquifer and the reduction of
   greenhouse effect gas emissions. We need to put emphasis on the fact
   that these in situ IWRM developed in this case, can lead to creation of
   smart spaces from smart projects through smart cities to smart
   watersheds. The results are promising and show that flood mitigation for
   the Bouskoura basin is 46\% of the peak flow. The other advantages are
   of useful importance in domestic use, infiltration to the aquifer, etc.
   The impacts for each unit such as airport, roads, administrative or
   industrial buildings are measured in this case. We can conclude that if
   more space is urbanized more the impact is important. The information
   carried out will provide in the future a decision support system to
   monitor sustainable urbanization development in the basin.}},

Abstract = {{Cities around the world are experiencing tremendous population growth,
   and this is especially true in the developing world. In this profile, we
   feature the city of Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, India. Chennai
   is the largest industrial commercial center in South India; it is often
   referred as the ``Detroit of India{''} and the ``Gateway to South
   India.{''} In recent decades, large industrial facilities have been
   established in Chennai and its suburbs resulting in large-scale
   population growth. However, this explosive growth has strained the urban
   infrastructure of this prominent city. In this profile, we provide an
   overview of Chennai's urban history from social, economic, political,
   and environmental perspectives. We highlight the current and future
   challenges faced by the city, and we argue that it is well poised to
   leverage emerging smart city technologies. However, to effectively
   implement these technologies, city administrators need to undertake
   several measures; for example, a database capturing all dimensions of
   the city must be developed. By clearly delineating the urban planning
   and policy efforts to the present and offering a way forward, this paper
   contributes to the growing literature on smart cities and the unique
   urban challenges faced by cities in the developing world. (C) 2014

Title = {{Factors influencing zoning ordinance adoption in rural and exurban
   townships}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{134}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Though 70\% of land in the contiguous U.S. is privately owned, land
   conservation discourses have focused more on public protected areas than
   on private land policy. U.S. private land policy is generally
   implemented by local governments through comprehensive plans and zoning
   ordinances. While most cities have adopted these policies many
   non-metropolitan jurisdictions remain unzoned. In this study we
   investigated factors predicting zoning adoption in rural and exurban
   Michigan townships. Results from a logit model showed that likelihood of
   zoning adoption between 1998 and 2003 was higher for townships with more
   developed land, fewer conservative voters, higher household income, more
   zoned neighbors, and township-level planning rather than county-level
   planning. We quantified thresholds at which development levels
   correlated with zoning adoption. Overall, townships had greater than a
   50\% probability of adopting zoning when 9\% or more of their land base
   had been developed, but this threshold was higher in townships with no
   planning (12\%) and highest where planning was implemented at the county
   level (19\%). In high-growth townships forestland was negatively
   correlated with zoning adoption. However, model results showed
   socioeconomic variables to be better predictors of zoning adoption than
   natural resource variables. These results highlight the importance that
   planning and zoning occur at the same level of government, and the
   importance of multiple policy options in jurisdictions unlikely to adopt
   zoning. Gaining insight into reasons for land-use policy adoption, or
   lack thereof, is important for achieving common planning goals,
   including preserving rural livelihoods, conserving forests and
   farmlands, and maintaining rural landscape characteristics. (C) 2014

Title = {{Be SMART: examining the experience of implementing the NHS Health Check
   in UK primary care}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: The NHS Health Check was designed by UK Department of Health
   to address increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease by identifying
   risk levels and facilitating behaviour change. It constituted biomedical
   testing, personalised advice and lifestyle support. The objective of the
   study was to explore Health Care Professionals' (HCPs) and patients'
   experiences of delivering and receiving the NHS Health Check in an
   inner-city region of England.
   Methods: Patients and HCPs in primary care were interviewed using
   semi-structured schedules. Data were analysed using Thematic Analysis.
   Results: Four themes were identified. Firstly, Health Check as a test of
   `roadworthiness' for people. The roadworthiness metaphor resonated with
   some patients but it signified a passive stance toward illness. Some
   patients described the check as useful in the theme, Health check as
   revelatory. HCPs found visual aids demonstrating levels of
   salt/fat/sugar in everyday foods and a `traffic light' tape measure
   helpful in communicating such `revelations' with patients. Being SMART
   and following the protocolrevealed that few HCPs used SMART goals and
   few patients spoke of them. HCPs require training to understand their
   rationale compared with traditional advice-giving. The need for further
   follow-up revealed disparity in follow-ups and patients were not
   systematically monitored over time.
   Conclusions: HCPs' training needs to include the use and evidence of the
   effectiveness of SMART goals in changing health behaviours. The
   significance of fidelity to protocol needs to be communicated to HCPs
   and commissioners to ensure consistency. Monitoring and measurement of
   follow-up, e.g., tracking of referrals, need to be resourced to provide
   evidence of the success of the NHS Health Check in terms of healthier
   lifestyles and reduced CVD risk.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{613-626}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{As a result of the integration of different methodological tools (life
   cycle assessment and dynamics simulation) and studies to evaluate the
   economic cost and the potential environmental impact of alternative
   water supplies (rainwater and greywater) for urban use, the software
   program Plugrisost (pluvials, greys and sustainability) has been
   developed. This modelling tool aims to contribute to urban water
   planning for smart city development. Plugrisost is a simulation model
   that facilitates the evaluation of rainwater harvesting (RWH) and
   greywater systems at different scales of urban planning, It is the only
   tool known thus far to integrate structural elements such as the sizing
   of storage tanks, estimated cost and quantitative environmental
   analysis. Plugrisost can be an adequate tool in the design stage because
   it provides environmental and economic information related to rainwater
   tank sizing and its estimates are more conservative than those of other
   tools. Plugrisost contributes to the design of urban infrastructure of
   low environmental impact, such as infrastructure that incorporates the
   use of rainwater, and the self-sufficiency analysis of water in cities.
   Using Plugrisost, we have found that on the singlehouse scale, the
   economic viability of an RWH system would be possible if the price of
   water is greater than 4 Euros/m(3); and the environmental analysis would
   be favourable to tanks with less than 5 m(3) of storage capacity. On the
   apartment-building scale, the results are 1.4 Euros/m(3) and 33 m(3),
   respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Abstract = {{Integrating alternative water supplies and water efficient appliances
   are proven strategies for reducing customers' average and peak demand on
   the cities mains water distribution infrastructure network. However,
   water utilities are yet to harness the potential of smart meters to
   build tailored daily diurnal demand patterns that reflect the
   consumption characteristics of individual developments that are
   increasingly applying alternative water sources and ultra-efficient
   appliances. This paper demonstrates how smart metering and water end-use
   data facilitates enhanced infrastructure planning of contemporary water
   supply schemes located in Queensland, Australia. To achieve research
   aims, extensive data received from high resolution smart meters fitted
   to a sample of 130 households was disaggregated into end use events
   (e.g. shower, dishwasher, etc.) and categorised into 48 thirty-minute
   time steps (i.e. daily diurnal demand) over the average day (AD) and
   peak day (PD). Moreover, these demand curves were also clustered
   according to water appliance stock efficiency ratings. Novel bottom-up
   end-use level models of demand were formulated representing scenarios of
   both single and multi-residential dwellings installed with combinations
   of water efficient appliances and rainwater tanks or greywater reuse. AD
   and PD diurnal demand patterns for these contemporary water scenarios
   were compared against the baseline scenario which represents the typical
   building code mandated dwelling constructed in the region of Queensland,
   Australia. Modelled demand curves for scenarios applying more efficient
   appliances in both dwelling types had lower peak demand than the
   baseline scenario by 13\% and 6\% for the AD and PD respectively, while
   scenarios also including rainwater tanks and greywater reuse (i.e.
   source substitution) resulted in peak reductions of 28\% on the AD and
   51\% on the PD. The paper concludes with some implications for better
   handling the demand complexities of contemporary water supply schemes
   being developed by using smart meter data for the optimal planning of
   water infrastructure networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper provides a brief overview of, and elaborates on, some of the
   presentations, discussions and conclusions from Day 4 of the `WHO EURO
   2014 International Healthy Cities Conference: Health and the City-Urban
   Living in the 21st Century', held in Athens, Greece on 25 October 2014.
   The Internet of Things (IoT) is made of sensors and other components
   that connect our version of the world made of atoms, i.e., humans/our
   bodies, our devices, vehicles, roads, buildings, plants, animals, etc.,
   with a mirror digital version made of bits. This enables cities and
   regions to be self-aware and dynamically reconfigurable in real-or
   near-real-time, based on changes that are continuously monitored and
   captured by sensors, similar to the way the internal biological systems
   of a living being operate and respond to their environment
   (homeostasis). Data collected by various IoT sensors and processed via
   appropriate analytics can also help predict the immediate future with
   reasonable accuracy, which enables better planned responses and
   mitigation actions. Cities and regions can thus become more adaptable
   and resilient in face of adversity. Furthermore, IoT can link atoms
   (humans) to other atoms (humans) (again via bits), resulting in the
   formation of `smart(er) communities' that are socially connected in new
   ways and potentially happier. Cities, but also less urbanised regions
   and the countryside, could all benefit from, and harness the power of,
   IoT to improve the health, well-being and overall quality of life of the
   local populations, actively engage citizens in a smarter governance of
   their region, empower them to better care for one another, promote
   stronger social inclusion, and ensure a greener, sustainable and more
   enjoyable environment for all. Technology can also help reverse the
   `brain drain' from the countryside and smaller towns to larger
   metropolises by making the former more attractive and connected, with
   better services akin to those found in larger cities. The article also
   discusses some ways of measuring and benchmarking the performance of
   smart cities and their impact on well-being. However, it should be
   emphasised that technology is not a panacea and that other factors are
   equally important in creating happier and healthier cities and regions.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the long-term impact that changes in a city's
   transportation infrastructure have on its spatial interactions remains a
   challenge. The difficulty arises from the fact that the real impact may
   not be revealed in static or aggregated mobility measures, as these are
   remarkably robust to perturbations. More generally, the lack of
   longitudinal, cross-sectional data demonstrating the evolution of
   spatial interactions at a meaningful urban scale also hinders us from
   evaluating the sensitivity of movement indicators, limiting our capacity
   to understand the evolution of urban mobility in depth. Using very large
   mobility records distributed over 3 years, we quantify the impact of the
   completion of a metro line extension: the Circle Line (CCL) in
   Singapore. We find that the commonly used movement indicators are almost
   identical before and after the project was completed. However, in
   comparing the temporal community structure across years, we do observe
   significant differences in the spatial reorganization of the affected
   geographical areas. The completion of CCL enables travellers to
   re-identify their desired destinations collectively with lower transport
   cost, making the community structure more consistent. These changes in
   locality are dynamic and characterized over short timescales, offering
   us a different approach to identify and analyse the long-term impact of
   new infrastructures on cities and their evolution dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{As the term ``smart city{''} gains wider and wider currency, there is
   still confusion about what a smart city is, especially since several
   similar terms are often used interchangeably. This paper aims to clarify
   the meaning of the word ``smart{''} in the context of cities through an
   approach based on an in-depth literature review of relevant studies as
   well as official documents of international institutions. It also
   identifies the main dimensions and elements characterizing a smart city.
   The different metrics of urban smartness are reviewed to show the need

Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{A great number of contributions regarding shrinking cities correspond to
   generic discourses on urban problems, which cover planning policies with
   approaches and strategies developed in somewhat diverse or even very
   different urban contexts. The debate on shrinkage is still feeble and
   fragmented. Perhaps this is owing to the character of shrinkage or its
   relative novelty. An explicit, unequivocal, and comprehensive
   theoretical debate and framework on the topic of planning for shrinkage
   is lacking. This entails a previous reflection about what shrinkage
   means or should mean, the role of urban and regional planning, and the
   contradictions of planning for shrinkage, which cause the paradox of
   planning for shrinkage. How can planning deal with shrinkage? What
   should policies for shrinkage look like? Is planning for shrinkage,
   planning for population decrease? Is it managing population decrease? Is
   it business as usual: planning to resume growth? What does managing
   shrinkage mean? The paper presents a theoretical debate and some
   preliminary conclusions addressing these questions.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of the Australian National Broadband Network (NBN) in
   2009 raised questions about the potentials of the telecommunications
   infrastructure for Australian urban and regional planning. The recent
   decision by the Australian Federal Government to build the NBN, using a
   mix of technologies, has intensified the need to investigate the
   implications of telecommunications at the local level, as Australian
   local governments then need to respond differently based on the level of
   access provided in each case. The paper investigates such implications
   in the three areas of e-governance, socioeconomic development, and
   spatial planning. Building upon the international literature, and
   empirical data collected from the Australian local governments, it
   analyzes a raft of mostly unscrutinized policy initiatives developed,
   over the last few years, to guide the early rollout. The findings show
   some policy development regarding the socioeconomic implications of the
   new infrastructure, limited understanding of e-governance potentials,
   and lagging policy focus on spatial planning.}},

Abstract = {{Automated computer vision techniques were used to analyze 2 h of video
   data collected at a major signalized intersection in New York City. The
   main objectives of this study were to diagnose pedestrian safety issues
   and identify contributing factors at the intersection and to demonstrate
   the feasibility of the automatic extraction of pedestrian data required
   for pedestrian behavior analysis mainly pedestrian speed and gait
   parameters. The safety study was conducted with traffic conflict
   techniques. The main factor that contributed to the high number of
   pedestrian and vehicle conflicts was found to be pedestrian violations,
   mainly temporal violations in which pedestrians crossed the street
   during the ``Don't Walk{''} or flashing ``Don't Walk{''} phase. During
   the 2 h analyzed, about one-third of pedestrians were noncompliant with
   the signal timing or crosswalk boundary (17.9\% spatial violations and
   15.3\% temporal violations). Pedestrian speed, step frequency, and step
   length were automatically extracted for 333 pedestrians and were found
   to follow the normal distribution with 95\% confidence (mean and
   standard deviation of 1.47 +/- 0.27 m/s, 1.96 +/- 0.17 Hz, and 0.75 +/-
   0.14 m, respectively). Gait analysis showed that the walking speed for
   single pedestrians was 9\% higher than for those who walked in groups.
   Males tended to be slightly faster than females, with higher step length
   but lower step frequency. Violators tended to have higher walking speeds
   compared with non violators, and the difference in speed was dependent
   on step length but not on step frequency.}},

Title = {{Neighbor Discovery for Opportunistic Networking in Internet of Things
   Scenarios: A Survey}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{1101-1131}},
Abstract = {{Neighbor discovery was initially conceived as a means to deal with
   energy issues at deployment, where the main objective was to acquire
   information about network topology for subsequent communication.
   Nevertheless, over recent years, it has been facing new challenges due
   to the introduction of mobility of nodes over static networks mainly
   caused by the opportunistic presence of nodes in such a scenario. The
   focus of discovery has, therefore, shifted toward more challenging
   environments, where connectivity opportunities need to be exploited for
   achieving communication. In fact, discovery has traditionally been
   focused on tradeoffs between energy and latency in order to reach an
   overlapping of communication times between neighboring nodes. With the
   introduction of opportunistic networking, neighbor discovery has instead
   aimed toward the more challenging problem of acquiring knowledge about
   the patterns of encounters between nodes. Many Internet of Things
   applications (e. g., smart cities) can, in fact, benefit from such
   discovery, since end-to-end paths may not directly exist between sources
   and sinks of data, thus requiring the discovery and exploitation of rare
   and short connectivity opportunities to relay data. While many of the
   older discovery approaches are still valid, they are not entirely
   designed to exploit the properties of these new challenging scenarios. A
   recent direction in research is, therefore, to learn and exploit
   knowledge about mobility patterns to improve the efficiency in the
   discovery process. In this paper, a new classification and taxonomy is
   presented with an emphasis on recent protocols and advances in this
   area, summarizing issues and ways for potential improvements. As we will
   show, knowledge integration in the process of neighbor discovery leads
   to a more efficient scheduling of the resources when contacts are
   expected, thus allowing for faster discovery, while, at the same time
   allowing for energy savings when such contacts are not expected.}},

   Public Safety Applications in 5G Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{1649-1654}},
Abstract = {{The device-to-device (D2D) communication paradigm in 5G networks
   provides an effective infrastructure to enable different smart city
   applications such as public safety. In future smart cities, dense
   deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be integrated with 5G
   networks using D2D communication. D2D communication enables direct
   communication between nearby user equipments (UEs) using cellular or ad
   hoc links, thereby improving the spectrum utilization, system
   throughput, and energy efficiency of the network. In this paper, we
   propose a hierarchal D2D communication architecture where a centralized
   software-defined network (SDN) controller communicates with the cloud
   head to reduce the number of requested long-term evolution (LTE)
   communication links, thereby improving energy consumption. The concept
   of local and central controller enables our architecture to work in case
   of infrastructure damage and hotspot traffic situation. The architecture
   helps to maintain the communication between disaster victims and first
   responders by installing multi-hop routing path with the support of the
   SDN controller. In addition, we highlight the robustness and potential
   of our architecture by presenting a public safety scenario, where a part
   of the network is offline due to extraordinary events such as disaster
   or terrorist attacks.}},

Abstract = {{With rapid economic growth, the management of employees working outdoors
   gradually becomes more intensive. The traditional attendance systems
   typically focus on collecting employee attendance information and are
   not suited to the quantification of work performance. As a remedy to
   this issue, a smart work performance measurement system is proposed in
   this paper. The proposed system consists of three components: 1) a
   smartphone-based APP to collect employee attendance, work, and location
   information; 2) a data warehouse to preprocess and store the data; and
   3) a smart data analysis center to make a comprehensive and systematic
   evaluation of employee work performance. Management can obtain the key
   information quickly and adjust work assignments based on performance.
   New solutions and algorithms for indoor and outdoor location, GPS
   deviation improvement, and work performance measurement are put forward.
   This system is being used by over 1100 police officers in one city
   traffic management bureau, and the observed results are encouraging,
   demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of our system, and helping
   governments to better regulate the traffic operation and reduce
   associated costs.}},

Abstract = {{Smart worlds begin with smart things, such as smart objects, smart
   cities, smart manufacturing, and smart systems, are overlaid with
   sensing and actuation, many embedded in things, and eventually encompass
   all aspects of the cyber, physical, social, and thinking hyperspace. In
   the future, human beings will live in a smart environment where both
   life and work are well addressed by technology, whereas humans will be
   responsible only for providing creativity. For this purpose, we have
   organized the first 2015 Smart World Congress, including five IEEE
   International Conferences. Specifically, a variety of challenges are
   presented in the field of smart world. Therefore, an open forum on the
   top ten challenges (ToplOCs) for smart worlds was held under the
   congress to identify the main challenges through collecting the
   intelligence existing particularly in crowd wisdom. ToplOCs and related
   works, as a crowdsourcing approach, discuss and analyze the top
   challenges for smart worlds based on the selective results of the crowd
   and experts via an online platform. Moreover, we summarize the
   experiences obtained in organizing the ToplOCs forum.}},

   Fare Data for Brisbane, Queensland, Australia}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2535}},
Pages = {{79-87}},
Abstract = {{Urban linear ferry systems are an emerging form of public transport in
   cities worldwide. The travel behavior of passengers who used CityCat
   ferries in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, was investigated with data
   from 1,675,821 smart card fare transactions for ferry trips made over a
   6-month period. Although services used small vessels and had only one
   main route, about 2.3\% of all paid public transport journeys in
   Brisbane were made on CityCat and the related cross-river ferries. The
   ferries were used more for commuting and university trips on weekdays
   with significant patronage in the morning and afternoon peak periods.
   Use was consistent on weekend days. Although use was strong, most users
   were infrequent patrons; this use suggested that leisure travel was a
   significant component of the system. Key terminals with high use rates
   included those where transfer to cross-river ferry services was
   possible. The system offered single-stop cross-river travel at many
   points. However, only 15.8\% of paid trips in March 2013 were made this
   way; 84.2\% of trips continued farther up- or downriver. Integration
   with other buses and trains was significant; about 15\% of all ferry
   journeys were linked to another mode of public transport. Additional
   investigation into how users access terminals and interact with other
   public transport modes is suggested. With expansion planned, the CityCat
   system could increase its contribution to public transport in Brisbane.
   Increasing the use frequency of the large pool of infrequent riders
   could increase patronage of the system.}},

Title = {{Smart city intellectual capital: an emerging view of territorial systems
   innovation management}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{860-887}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore whether and how the
   intellectual capital (IC) approach and concepts could be fruitfully
   adapted to study the smart city phenomenon from a managerial point of
   view.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on a long-term,
   in-depth ethnographic exploration of the vast global community, which is
   created around the smart city movement.
   Findings -The analysis suggests that, in order to effectively analyse a
   smart city context through the IC lens, the traditional IC framework
   needs to be extended for: expected outcomes, which should also include
   sustainability, resilience and quality of life; categories of key
   resources, which should also include institutional capital and
   environmental capital; units of analysis, which should also include
   territorial systems, such as transportation or waste; and key managerial
   challenges implied. As a final result, a smart city intellectual capital
   (SC-IC) framework is proposed.
   Research limitations/implications - Most of the cases analysed in this
   study are European; further studies are advisable to better investigate
   non-European smart city contexts.
   Practical implications - The paper suggests that the knowledge
   management, project portfolio management and network management
   approaches are crucial to better support managerial practices in smart
   city organizations.
   Originality/value - The SC-IC framework allows for a clear definition of
   the smart city organization, as a new knowledge-based, project-oriented,
   network-shaped type of organization. Therefore, the SC-IC framework
   provides smart city research with a consistent rooting in management
   studies. Further, this paper contributes to the fourth stage of IC
   research.}},

Abstract = {{In the digital economy, Smart City represents one of the medium and

   by the improvement and concrete application of the European model
   proposed by the team coordinated by Giffinger in 2007 for the Romanian
   cities, as an emerging economy country in East Europe. In order to
   attain this goal, the authors developed an exploratory research method
   based on direct observation accompanied by the synthetic and critical
   analysis of several selected Romanian cities that fulfil the minimum
   criteria of smart cities in compliance with the European methodology.
   The results of this study reveal that from the 41 cities, only 6

Title = {{Agatha: Predicting Daily Activities from Place Visit History for
   Activity-Aware Mobile Services in Smart Cities}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{We present a place-history-based activity prediction system called
   Agatha, in order to enable activity-aware mobile services in smart
   cities. The system predicts a user's potential subsequent activities
   that are highly likely to occur given a series of information about
   activities done before or activity-related contextual information such
   as visit place and time. To predict the activities, we develop a
   causality-based activity prediction model using Bayesian networks. The
   basic idea of the prediction is that where a person has been and what
   he/she has done so far influence what he/she will do next. To show the
   feasibility, we evaluate the prediction model using the American
   Time-Use Survey (ATUS) dataset, which includes more than 10,000 people's
   location and activity history. Our evaluation shows that Agatha can
   predict users' potential activities with up to 90\% accuracy for the top
   3 activities, more than 80\% for the top 2 activities, and about 65\%
   for the top 1 activity while considering a relatively large number of
   daily activities defined in the ATUS dataset, that is, 17 activities.}},

   Transit-Oriented Smart Growth}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2502}},
Pages = {{53-61}},
Abstract = {{Cities are developing greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation plans and
   reduction targets on the basis of a growing body of knowledge about
   climate change risks, and changes to passenger transportation are often
   at the center of these efforts. Yet little information exists for
   characterizing how quickly or slowly GHG emissions reductions will
   accrue given changes in urban form around transit and whether benefits
   will accrue quickly enough to meet policy year targets (such as reaching
   20\% of 1990 GHG emissions levels by 2050). Achieving GHG reductions
   through integrated transportation and land use planning is even more
   complicated for cities because changes in emissions can occur across
   many sectors (such as transportation, building energy use, and
   electricity generation). With the use of the Los Angeles, California,
   Expo Line, a framework was developed to assess how financing schemes
   could affect the rate of building redevelopment and resulting life-cycle
   GHG emissions from travel and building energy use. The framework
   leveraged an integrated transportation and land use life-cycle
   assessment model that captured upfront construction of new development
   near transit and the long-term changes in household energy use for
   travel and buildings. The results show that for the same amount of
   development around the Expo Line, it is possible either to meet state
   GHG goals by 2050 (if aggressive redevelopment happens early) or not
   meet those goals by 2050 (if significant redevelopment does not start
   for decades). The time-based approach reveals how redevelopment
   schedules should be considered when strategies for meeting future GHG
   emissions targets are set.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{47-57}},
Abstract = {{Air temperature and humidity conditions were monitored in Hradec
   Kralove, Czech Republic, by a network of meteorological stations.
   Meteorological sensors were placed across a representative variety of
   urban and suburban environments. The data collected over the 2011-2014
   period are analysed in this paper. The data from reference standard
   meteorological stations were used for comparison and modelling purposes.
   Air temperatures at the points of interest were successfully modelled
   using regression relationships. The spatial expression of point
   measurements of air temperatures was provided by GIS methods in
   combination with CORINE land cover layer, and satellite thermal images
   were used to evaluate the significance of these methods. The use of
   standard climate information has low priority for urban planners. The
   impact of the urban heat island on city residents and visitors was
   evaluated using the HUMIDEX index, as it is more understandable for
   urban planners than temperature conditions as such. The aim of this
   paper is the modification, description and presentation of urban climate
   evaluation methods that are easily useable for spatial planning
   purposes. These methods are based on comprehensible, easily available
   but quality data and results. This unified methodology forms a

Abstract = {{Housing intensification contributes to the strategic aims of many urban
   areas worldwide, and can also enable financing of major repairs in
   collectively owned residential buildings. The aim of this article is to
   develop understanding of the decision-making process concerning the
   infill development on a collectively owned plot of a housing company in
   Finland. As data we use theme interviews of people managing five case
   housing companies in Helsinki. The results of the cross-case analysis
   indicate that the decision-making process is unestablished. Key issues
   and stages of the process are identified and analysed further.
   Challenges exist on three levels: (1) legal and land use planning, (2)
   collective action and management, (3) required professionals. The

Abstract = {{What has shaped the US urban landscape? Probably, different forces
   worked at different magnitudes, times, and locations. In this paper we
   develop a methodology to disaggregate some of the engines of US city
   growth over time and across space. To understand the results we propose
   a visualization approach based on what we term storyboards, which create
   an intuitive and dynamic narrative on the effect of several factors of
   urban success. This allows us to show that the role of growth engines
   differs greatly: the rise and decline of manufacturing were very
   localized; industrial specialization is counterproductive, particularly
   so in the 1990s; service sectors used to be a consumption amenity, but
   now serve as a production amenity; and highly educated cities
   unambiguously and increasingly attract firms in any part of the US. We
   also note that the arguments for our visualization and its lessons bear
   implications for visualization in the social sciences beyond this
   particular example.}},

Title = {{An Efficient Prediction-Based Data Forwarding Strategy in Vehicular Ad
   Hoc Network}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{As an important infrastructure of intelligent transportation system
   (ITS), vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) provide navigation and
   positioning, information services, driver assistance, in-vehicle
   entertainment, and other functions for the owners improving the
   development of the future smart city. Due to the high dynamic nature of
   VANETs, choosing a relatively stable and reliable transmission path to
   reduce the link breakage is obviously very important. In this paper, we
   propose an efficient prediction-based data forwarding strategy to ensure
   the reliability and efficiency of data transmission in VANETs. Besides
   the link lifetime prediction, we introduce a new metric named link
   utility used in the process of forwarder selection, in order to improve
   data forwarding efficiency. Link utility reflects the impact of relative
   velocity and distance between the vehicles on the efficiency of
   intervehicle data transmissions. It can be used to optimize packet
   routing and minimize number of hops especially in the high-density
   VANETs. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed forwarding
   strategy through simulation confirming its feasibility and
   effectiveness.}},

Title = {{Large-Scale Mobile Sensing Enabled Internet-of-Things Testbed for Smart
   City Services}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Smart cities are one of the key application domains for the
   Internet-of-Things paradigm. Extending the Web into the physical realm
   of a city, by means of the widespread deployment of spatially
   distributed Internet-addressable devices with sensing and/or actuation
   capabilities, allows improving efficiency of city services. Vehicles
   moving around the city become excellent probes when the objective is to
   gather information across the city in a cost effective manner. Public
   transportation fleets, taxis, or vehicles such as waste collection
   trucks cover most of the urban areas with a limited number of vehicles.
   This paper presents the deployment of a large scale Internet-of-Things
   testbed that has been carried out in the city of Santander. It extends
   previous descriptions by providing a specification of one of the unique
   features of the testbed, namely, the devices that have been installed on
   140 buses, taxis, and vans that every day drive around the city. Besides
   the physical characteristics of the devices installed and the lessons
   learnt during the deployment, the paper introduces the three mobile
   sensing network strategies used for distributing the data gathered.
   Finally, the paper sketches some of smart city services which might be
   provided using the information coming from the mobile IoT devices.}},

Title = {{An Online-Traffic-Prediction Based Route Finding Mechanism for Smart
   City}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Finding fastest driving routes is significant for the intelligent
   transportation system. While predicting the online traffic conditions of
   road segments entails a variety of challenges, it contributes much to
   travel time prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose O-Sense, an
   innovative online-traffic-prediction based route finding mechanism,
   which organically utilizes large scale taxi GPS traces and environmental
   information. O-Sense firstly exploits a deep learning approach to
   process spatial and temporal taxi GPS traces shown in dynamic patterns.
   Meanwhile, we model the traffic flow state for a given road segment
   using a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF), a technique that
   well forecasts the temporal transformation if provided with further
   supplementary environmental resources. O-Sense then fuses previously
   obtained outputs with a dynamic weighted classifier and generates a
   better traffic condition vector for each road segment at different
   prediction time. Finally, we perform online route computing to find the
   fastest path connecting consecutive road segments in the route based on
   the vectors. Experimental results show that O-Sense can estimate the
   travel time for driving routes more accurately.}},

Title = {{SensorHUB: An IoT Driver Framework for Supporting Sensor Networks and
   Data Analysis}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the surrounding everyday
   physical objects into an ecosystem of information that enriches our
   everyday life. The IoT represents the convergence of advances in
   miniaturization, wireless connectivity, and increased data storage and
   is driven by various sensors. Sensors detect and measure changes in
   position, temperature, light, and many others; furthermore, they are
   necessary to turn billions of objects into data-generating ``things{''}
   that can report on their status and often interact with their
   environment. Application and service development methods and frameworks
   are required to support the realization of solutions covering data
   collection, transmission, data processing, analysis, reporting, and
   advanced querying. This paper introduces the SensorHUB framework that
   utilizes the state-of-the-art open source technologies and provides a
   unified tool chain for IoT related application and service development.
   SensorHUB is both a method and an environment to support IoT related
   application and service development; furthermore, it supports the data
   monetization approach, that is, provides a method to define data views
   on top of different data sources and analyzed data. The framework is
   available in a Platform as a Service (PaaS) model and has been applied
   for the vehicle, health, production lines, and smart city domains.}},

Title = {{The Informational World City London}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{834-864}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The Department of Information Science of the
   Heinrich-Heine-University in Dusseldorf is currently conducting a
   research project on Informational World Cities - the prototypical cities
   of the knowledge society, which have been growing in the twenty-first
   century. In total, 31 potential Informational World Cities were
   identified and a set of criteria was developed to evaluate the degree of
   informativeness of a city through coherent criteria. The purpose of this
   paper is to investigate London.
   Design/methodology/approach - The investigation was based on the
   Grounded Theory, ethnographic field research, interviews, bibliometrics,
   patentometrics, official statistics and the analysis of web content.
   During the stay in London, eight semi-standardised interviews according
   to SERVQUAL were conducted.
   Findings - The characteristics of an Informational World City are
   well-marked in most cases, especially London's knowledge infrastructure.
   Furthermore London places value on smart innovations and tries to adapt
   public transport to the growing population. This includes, next to an
   enhancement of the train capacities, information and communication
   technology, since the digital infrastructure keeps gaining importance.
   The ethnic/cultural diversity as well as the international connectivity
   and the creative infrastructure are also distinguishing marks of London.
   Nevertheless, especially the digital and smart infrastructure require
   enhancement. London's government is ambitioned, though, to make progress
   and pursues plans which are of benefit to the city's informativeness.
   Social implications - This paper gives insight into the characteristics
   of the prototypical city of the upcoming knowledge society.
   Originality/value - This paper follows an interdisciplinary approach and
   combines information science, urban studies and sociology to analyse
   cities of the knowledge society. Furthermore it is the first time that
   London is considered an Informational World City in an empirical study.}},

Journal = {{SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{237-248}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of smart
   city initiatives and big data on supply chain management (SCM). More
   specifically, the connections between smart cities, big data and supply
   network characteristics (supply network structure and governance
   mechanisms) are investigated.
   Design/methodology/approach - An integrative framework is proposed,
   grounded on a literature review on smart cities, big data and supply
   networks. Then, the relationships between these constructs are analyzed,
   using the proposed integrative framework.
   Findings - Smart cities have different implications to network structure
   (complexity, density and centralization) and governance mechanisms
   (formal vs informal). Moreover, this work highlights and discusses the
   future research directions relating to smart cities and SCM.
   Research limitations/implications - The relationships between smart
   cities, big data and supply networks cannot be described simply by using
   a linear, cause-and-effect framework. Accordingly, an integrative
   framework that can be used in future empirical studies to analyze smart
   cities and big data implications on SCM has been proposed.
   Practical implications - Smart cities and big data alone have limited
   capacity of improving SCM processes, but combined they can support
   improvement initiatives. Nevertheless, smart cities and big data can
   also suppose some novel obstacles to effective SCM.
   Originality/value - Several studies have analyzed information technology
   innovation adoption in supply chains, but, to the best of our knowledge,
   no study has focused on smart cities.}},

Title = {{Enterprise systems: are we ready for future sustainable cities}},
Journal = {{SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{264-283}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to revisit the adoption reasons of enterprise
   systems (ES) and supply chain management systems (SCMS) and to explore
   the new dimensions of sustainability required to be added in the whole
   process of adoption of these systems. Moreover, it aims to explore the
   benefits of ES to organizations and to relate these benefits to the ES
   adoption in future sustainable city settings. Future cities will have
   micro-industries requiring dynamic interactions and will be dependent on
   efficient supply chains. The recent developments in information and
   communications technology (ICT) such as cloud computing through its
   dynamic, on-demand and service-based delivery are making it possible to
   achieve those goals for supply chains. The ES in general and more
   specifically SCMS have integrated organizations into one seamless mesh.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a framework for
   adoption of sustainable ES in a smart city setting. The framework,
   firstly, is presented at a macro-level, particularly incorporating the
   relative significance of motivational factors for sustainable ES
   adoption. Subsequently, The authors study the benefits of ES as
   perceived by large and small and medium enterprise (SME) organizations
   using 100 case studies and discuss how these benefits can be realized
   for smart cities by projecting the ES benefits onto the proposed
   framework. The benefits are estimated with the Shang and Seddon's (2002)
   framework.
   Findings - The adoption of ES initiated with environmental factors and
   mediated with business and technical factors will bring benefits in all
   the dimensions of triple bottom line in addition to the firm's
   performance. ES will have pivotal role in future smart city settings and
   will be able to offer social, environmental and economic sustainability
   in addition to traditional organizational performance indicators.
   Originality/value - The proposed framework for ES adoption will bring ES
   packages (particularly, the required relative significance of adoption
   reasons) into the perspective of sustainable development. Moreover, the
   study of its benefits in relation to the proposed sustainable ES
   adoption framework presented in this paper will help in motivating
   organizations to incorporate social, economic and environmental
   sustainability into their core business objectives.}},

Title = {{EAP-Swift: An Efficient Authentication and Key Generation Mechanism for
   Resource Constrained WSNs}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Technological advances within the area of wireless sensor technology
   allow WSNs to be used in a increasing number of measurement scenarios.
   As new application areas are emerging, such as infrastructure monitoring
   and smart cities, the need for sensor mobility handling requires
   efficient and secure authentication protocols. This paper presents
   EAP-Swift, a novel EAP based authentication protocol with a focus on
   lightweight processing and faster response. It supports end-to-end
   session encryption key generation and mutual authentication. By
   utilizing lightweight hashing algorithms, the challenge-response
   authentication mechanism uses only two round trips to the AAA server for
   the complete authentication procedure leading to the reduction of
   latency by 33\% compared to the baseline protocols. Further, using
   extensive experimentation, we validate that the authentication time can
   be kept below 250 ms and the power consumption can be kept below 15 mJ.
   Furthermore, we show that a battery lifetime of more than four years can
   be achieved when running the system on a regular button cell battery.
   Finally, the protocol was verified in terms of security using the AVISPA
   tool.}},

Title = {{On the Effect of Different Grips of Handsets on Data Rate in the
   Measured Channels}},
Journal = {{International Journal of Antennas and Propagation}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The investigation on the achieved data rate of the cellular system
   considering different grips of handsets at different frequencies using
   measurement results of the measurement campaign-which was carried out in
   the city of Aalborg-is presented in this paper. The achieved data rate
   of the multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel is
   investigated. A typical propagation environment using two BSs and four
   handsets, like smart phones, held by four to eight different users was
   designed and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels in different
   scenarios were measured. In this paper, two BSs and two handsets at each
   measurement time are considered. The impact of the different parameters
   like correlation, different grips of handsets, and different long term
   evolution (LTE) frequency bands on the achieved data rate is
   investigated for different measurements. It could be concluded that the
   variations in the values of data rate are weakly associated with the
   different grips of handsets butmore correlated with different
   frequencies.}},

Title = {{A Survey from the Perspective of Evolutionary Process in the Internet of
   Things}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The title of this paper may suggest such topics as routing, networking,
   and data mining, but we focus on new research angles regarding the
   Internet of Things (IoT) as the theme of this paper. These research
   angles come from other disciplines and are in the process of being
   adopted by the IoT. Our paper serves a key purpose: from the perspective
   of correlative technologies based on time, to review the evolutionary
   process of the IoT and depict the relations between the correlation
   techniques which are largely missing in current literature in which the
   focus has been more on the introduction and comparison of existing
   technologies and less on issues describing evolutionary process of the
   IoT. We consider that the latter is crucial to understanding the
   evolution of the IoT. Through generalizations of particular focus in
   different stages of each technology, we can better understand the
   current phase of the IoT and therefore predict future challenges. This
   paper aims to bridge this gap by providing guidance in terms of the
   evolutionary process of the IoT and gives readers a panoramic view of
   the IoT field without repeating what is already available in existing
   literature so as to complement the existing IoT survey papers which have

Title = {{ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND URBANIZATION IN CHINA}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1-2, SI}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aims: China is the largest energy consumer and producer in the world.
   Energy is crucial for the enduring and healthy development of China.
   Promoting urbanization has been regarded as a strategic measure for
   China to release the potential of domestic demand against the background
   of enduring international financial crisis. Usually, urban areas are
   more energy intensive than rural ones. Therefore, it's very meaningful
   to understand the relationship between energy and urbanization. The main
   aim of the paper is to study the relationship between energy and urban
   developments based on the analysis of China's energy and urban
   development, and provide a clear picture of the impacts of urbanization
   on energy development, which contributes to forming a base for further
   study of urban and energy relevant policies.
   Scope: The paper presents a thorough analysis of China's energy
   development and urbanization. Then it conducts a systematic and in-depth
   study of the impacts of urbanization on energy development
   quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, some helpful recommendations
   are provided for the coordinated development of China's energy industry
   and urbanization.
   Core findings: (1) Urban development will bring about interregional
   impacts on energy flow pattern. The new pattern is likely to be
   described as remaining stable in the eastern region, speeding up in the
   central and gradually increasing in the western. (2) Urban development
   will promote to form new intraregional energy systems. The city will be
   the most energy-intensive in the new system. The layout of the urban
   industrial system will be a ``U-shape{''} in terms of energy intensity.
   The urban industrial system can be divided into three parts, namely, the
   core zone including the city itself, suburb zones and exurban zones. The
   core zone is the most energy intensive among the three. The exurban
   zones are more intensive than the suburb zones. (3) Urban development
   will increase energy consumption. In the period of 2015 similar to 2020,
   the incremental energy consumption effected by urban development will be
   664 million tce; in the period of 2021 similar to 2030, that will be 774
   million tce. (4) Urban development will influence energy mix thanks to
   people's awareness of environmental and eco-system protection, and
   implementing such technologies as smart grid, UHV transmission and so
   on. Also, urban development will increase electricity consumption.
   Conclusions: Urbanization and energy development are two strategically
   important issues. By 2030, hundreds of millions of people will transfer
   from village to city. Many new cities and city clusters will emerge,
   which will give rise to the transfer of industry and influence the
   development of energy. China's urban development both provides a
   precious opportunity and constitutes an immense challenge for its energy
   development. Firstly, the plan for urban development and that for energy
   development should be coordinated in terms of infrastructure layout,
   energy mix, energy supply and distribution, etc. Secondly, give full
   play to smart grid in such aspects as integrating renewables, promoting
   energy conservation, leading to consumption habits and meeting the
   demand of divers and multilateral services, accommodating electric
   vehicles and so on. Thirdly, adhere to such principles as advocating
   environmental and eco-system protection, developing in a way of being
   driven by innovation, and taking urban and rural situations into account
   accordingly. Fourthly, combine the transformation of its energy
   production and consumption with the development of urbanization, more
   organically, systematically and efficiently.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{503-520}},
Abstract = {{Located halfway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, the mixed-use
   mega-development called Waterfall City is a master-planned, holistically
   designed, urban enclave built entirely from scratch on 2200 ha of vacant
   land. This expansive city-building project at Waterfall City combines a
   hypermodernist stress on `smart' growth, cutting-edge technologies, and
   state-of-the-art infrastructure with the New Urbanist focus on mixed-use
   facilities, a human-scale built environment, and pedestrian-friendly
   precincts. By performing all the conventional functions expected of a
   municipal administration, the real estate developers at Waterfall City
   have effectively replaced public authority with private management and
   control. With its private governance structures and `go-it-alone'
   mentality, Waterfall City is an exemplary expression of a privately
   managed municipality that falls within the broad tradition of company
   towns, treaty concessions, free ports, and independent city-states.
   Apart from its sheer size and scale and administrative autonomy, the
   outstanding feature of Waterfall City is its unique blend of stern
   religious conformity (grounded in a traditional interpretation of
   Islamic principles) combined with a forward-looking commitment to
   private enterprise and consumerist consumption.}},

Title = {{Fabrication of Porous Silicon Based Humidity Sensing Elements on Paper}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{A roll-to-roll compatible fabrication process of porous silicon (pSi)
   based sensing elements for a real-time humidity monitoring is described.
   The sensing elements, consisting of printed interdigitated silver
   electrodes and a spray-coated pSi layer, were fabricated on a coated
   paper substrate by a two-step process. Capacitive and resistive
   responses of the sensing elements were examined under different
   concentrations of humidity. More than a three orders of magnitude
   reproducible decrease in resistance was measured when the relative
   humidity (RH) was increased from 0\% to 90\%. A relatively fast recovery
   without the need of any refreshing methods was observed with a change in
   RH. Humidity background signal and hysteresis arising from the paper
   substrate were dependent on the thickness of sensing pSi layer.
   Hysteresis in most optimal sensing element setup (a thick pSi layer) was
   still noticeable but not detrimental for the sensing. In addition to
   electrical characterization of sensing elements, thermal degradation and
   moisture adsorption properties of the paper substrate were examined in
   connection to the fabrication process of the silver electrodes and the
   moisture sensitivity of the paper. The results pave the way towards the
   development of low-cost humidity sensors which could be utilized, for
   example, in smart packaging applications or in smart cities to monitor
   the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Social, technological and economic changes, citizen demand of services
   modernization, new ICT developments related to the Internet of Things
   and an economic situation that urges more efficient public
   administrations, have allowed the adoption of ICT by municipalities in
   order to provide public services. All the foregoing constitutes a boost
   of the smart city concept, which is considered in the scientific
   literature mainly from a technical point of view, overlooking deeper
   analysis on the specific services being provided by means of smart
   technologies. The current research identifies services provided using
   smart technologies at 26 Spanish smart cities and the degree of smart
   development of those cities based on which services provide. The results
   highlight that the services most widely implemented are those that allow
   direct reductions in local administration expenditure. On the other
   hand, the remaining services enjoy greater perspectives of future
   development. Additionally, three groups of smart city development have
   been identified, which allows benchmarking analysis and enhances the
   exchange of information between the cities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the methodology for the synthesis of real-time
   applications working in the ``Internet of Things{''} environment. We
   propose the client-server architecture, where embedded systems act as
   smart clients and the Internet application is a server of the system.
   The architecture of the application conforms to the cloud computing
   model. Since centralized systems are prone to bottlenecks caused by
   accumulation of transmissions or computations, we propose the
   distributed architecture of the server and the methodology that
   constructs this architecture using Internet resources supported by a
   cloud provider. We assume that the function of the server is specified
   as a set of distributed algorithms, and then our methodology schedules
   all tasks on the available network infrastructure. It takes into account
   limited bandwidth of communication channels as well as the limited
   computation power of server nodes. The method minimizes the cost of
   using network resources that are necessary to execute all tasks in
   real-time. We also present a sample application for adaptive control of
   traffic in a smart city, which shows the bene fits of using our
   methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The growing size of cities and increasing population mobility have
   determined a rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the roads,
   which has resulted in many challenges for road traffic management
   authorities in relation to traffic congestion, accidents, and air
   pollution. Over the recent years, researchers from both industry and
   academia have been focusing their efforts on exploiting the advances in
   sensing, communication, and dynamic adaptive technologies to make the
   existing road traffic management systems (TMSs) more efficient to cope
   with the aforementioned issues in future smart cities. However, these
   efforts are still insufficient to build a reliable and secure TMS that
   can handle the foreseeable rise of population and vehicles in smart
   cities. In this survey, we present an up-to-date review of the different
   technologies used in the different phases involved in a TMS and discuss
   the potential use of smart cars and social media to enable fast and more
   accurate traffic congestion detection and mitigation. We also provide a
   thorough study of the security threats that may jeopardize the
   efficiency of the TMS and endanger drivers' lives. Furthermore, the most
   significant and recent European and worldwide projects dealing with
   traffic congestion issues are briefly discussed to highlight their
   contribution to the advancement of smart transportation. Finally, we
   discuss some open challenges and present our own vision to develop
   robust TMSs for future smart cities.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the design of a Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP) proxy able to interconnect Web applications based on
   Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Web Socket with CoAP based
   Wireless Sensor Networks. Sensor networks are commonly used to monitor
   and control physical objects or environments. Smart Cities represent
   applications of such a nature. Wireless Sensor Networks gather data from
   their surroundings and send them to a remote application. This data flow
   may be short or long lived. The traditional HTTP long-polling used by
   Web applications may not be adequate in long-term communications. To
   overcome this problem, we include the WebSocket protocol in the design
   of the CoAP proxy. We evaluate the performance of the CoAP proxy in
   terms of latency and memory consumption. The tests consider long and
   short-lived communications. In both cases, we evaluate the performance
   obtained by the CoAP proxy according to the use of WebSocket and HTTP

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) allows machines and devices in the world to
   connect with each other and generate a huge amount of data, which has a
   great potential to provide useful knowledge across service domains.
   Combining the context of IoT with semantic technologies, we can build
   integrated semantic systems to support semantic interoperability. In
   this paper, we propose an integrated semantic service platform (ISSP) to
   support ontological models in various IoT-based service domains of a
   smart city. In particular, we address three main problems for providing
   integrated semantic services together with IoT systems: semantic
   discovery, dynamic semantic representation, and semantic data repository
   for IoT resources. To show the feasibility of the ISSP, we develop a
   prototype service for a smart office using the ISSP, which can provide a
   preset, personalized office environment by interpreting user text input
   via a smartphone. We also discuss a scenario to show how the ISSP-based
   method would help build a smart city, where services in each service
   domain can discover and exploit IoT resources that are wanted across
   domains. We expect that our method could eventually contribute to
   providing people in a smart city with more integrated, comprehensive
   services based on semantic interoperability.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Rapid urban land expansion and the resulting arable land loss have put
   food security in China at risk. This paper investigates the
   characteristics and mechanism of arable land conversion in Beijing using
   a logistic model based on land-use data for 2001 and 2010. The results
   suggest that (1) arable land conversion tends to occur near built-up
   areas, city centers and major roads; (2) arable land that lies closer to
   irrigation canals and country roads is less likely to be converted to
   urban use; (3) arable land that is bigger in size and has a more regular
   shape has a lower probability of conversion to urban use; and (4) the
   Prime Farmland Protection policy and related land-use plan have played a
   positive role in preserving arable land, demonstrated by the probability
   for arable land conversion inside a prime farmland boundary is 63.9
   percent less than for land outside the boundary. Based on these findings
   and on sustainable-development principles, we suggest that, rather than
   an exclusive focus on controlling the quantity of arable land, the
   location and characteristics of the arable land should be a primary
   consideration when designing urban policies and plans.}},

Abstract = {{Polycentric theory, as applied to sustainability policy adoption,
   contends that municipalities will act independently to provide public
   services that protect the environment. Our multilevel regression
   analysis of survey responses from 1,497 municipalities across the United
   States challenges that notion. We find that internal drivers of
   municipal action are insufficient. Lower policy adoption is explained by
   capacity constraints. More policy making occurs in states with a
   multilevel governance framework supportive of local sustainability
   action. Contrary to Fischel's homevoter hypothesis, we find large cities
   and rural areas show higher levels of adoption than suburbs (possibly
   due to free riding within a metropolitan region).}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there are many researchers investigate about the
   recommendation system for improving the parking experience. In this
   work, we propose an innovative adaptive recommendation mechanism for
   smart parking. The cognitive RE module will transmit the vehicle
   location information and parking space requirement to parking congestion
   cloud center (PCCC) when the drivers need to find a parking space.
   Moreover we use cellular automata model mechanism for those parking
   spaces in the parking lot, it can adjust the situation that some parking
   lots are full and some are not. We also adopted the Artificial Fish
   Swarm Algorithm to build this two parts parking recommendation
   mechanism. Here the PCCC can compute with vehicle location information,
   nearest parking lot, parking lot status and the same or opposite driving
   direction. We take the driving direction into consideration can reduce
   road congestion and speed up finding a parking space from vehicles
   turning around. The current study evaluates the performance of the
   approach by conducting computer simulations. Simulation results the
   strengths of the proposed smart parking mechanism in terms of increased
   congestion avoiding and decrease parking space finding time.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we put forward two ideas for monitoring the Smart Cities
   initiative in a better way. In developing the first idea, we study past
   and on-going initiatives in the field of sustainable cities and livable
   cities and their respective monitoring indicators to demonstrate that
   not only is a set of indicators needed for efficient monitoring, but
   also a final synthetic or aggregative index to visualize the
   initiative's achievements. Specifically, we propose the construction of
   synthetic indices using principal component analysis (PCA). The second
   idea attempts to anticipate the changes needed, especially with regard
   to data collection, to be introduced in current monitoring practices to
   assess a city's ``smartness{''} accurately. We propose the use of
   real-time data instead of historical statistics as the basic information
   with which to construct a set of indicators to explain the initiative. A
   final index summarizing Smart Cities' real-time set of indicators is
   suggested in the conclusion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   the private car reduction potential of car2go, the first free-floating
   carsharing-system, which was launched in Germany in 2009. A randomised
   controlled trial of different electrification-scenarios was incorporated
   into an online survey of car2go-users. The results indicated that the
   shown electrification-scenario (e.g. regional vs. green electricity)
   influenced the respondents' car reduction willingness. An additional
   split-sample comparison of users having previously driven electric vs.
   gasoline car2go-cars showed that having driven an electric-car2go
   increased the willingness to forgo a private car purchase. Policymakers
   and carsharing-providers could use the findings to increase the
   environmental gains achieved by carsharing-systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The present investigation describes the results of a research project
   (P.R.I.M.E.) aimed at testing the performance and the environmental
   impact of an electric city car in Italian cities. The vehicle considered
   in the project is the Daimler AG Smart ForTwo Electric Drive. A Smart ED
   vehicle was tested at the University of Salento for six months over
   different driving conditions (routes, traffic, use of auxiliaries). A
   data acquisition system has been designed on purpose and assembled on
   board to provide information about driving cycle and energy flows. The
   system was also used to evaluate the losses of energy during recharges
   due to the battery cooling system. The experimental tests were used to
   identify the average, minimum and maximum consumption of electricity in
   the Smart ED in Lecce according to driving conditions and in particular
   according to the usage of auxiliaries.
   The measured data of electric consumption have been used to quantify the
   emissions of CO2 and pollution of the vehicle using information about
   the Italian electricity production mix of each recharging event and the
   emissions factors of the Italian power plants with an innovative and

Abstract = {{Cloud computing technologies can support high-performance geospatial
   services in various domains, such as smart city and agriculture. Apache
   Hadoop, an open-source software framework, can be used to build a cloud
   environment on commodity clusters for storage and large-scale processing

   (W3DS) is a portrayal service for three-dimensional (3-D) geospatial
   data. Its performance could be improved by cloud computing technologies.
   This paper investigates how OGC W3DS could be developed in a cloud
   computing environment. It adopts the Apache Hadoop as the framework to
   provide a cloud implementation. The design and implementation of the 3-D
   geospatial information cloud service is presented. The performance
   evaluation is performed over data retrieval tests running in a cloud

Abstract = {{This paper presents the generic concept of using cloud-based intelligent
   car parking services in smart cities as an important application of the

   to its pure business-oriented features. A high-level view of the
   proposed middleware is outlined and the corresponding operational
   platform is illustrated. To demonstrate the provision of car parking
   services, based on the proposed middleware, a cloud-based intelligent
   car parking system for use within a university campus is described along
   with details of its design, implementation, and operation. A number of
   software solutions, including Kafka/Storm/Hbase clusters, OSGi web

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe a novel proposal in the field of smart cities:
   using an ontology matching algorithm to guarantee the automatic
   information exchange between the agents and the smart city. A smart city
   is composed by different types of agents that behave as producers and/or
   consumers of the information in the smart city. In our proposal, the
   data from the context is obtained by sensor and device agents while
   users interact with the smart city by means of user or system agents.
   The knowledge of each agent, as well as the smart city's knowledge, is
   semantically represented using different ontologies. To have an open
   city, that is fully accessible to any agent and therefore to provide
   enhanced services to the users, there is the need to ensure a seamless
   communication between agents and the city, regardless of their inner
   knowledge representations, i.e., ontologies. To meet this goal we use
   ontology matching techniques, specifically we have defined a new
   ontology matching algorithm called OntoPhil to be deployed within a
   smart city, which has never been done before. OntoPhil was tested on the
   benchmarks provided by the well known evaluation initiative, Ontology
   Alignment Evaluation Initiative, and also compared to other matching
   algorithms, although these algorithms were not specifically designed for
   smart cities. Additionally, specific tests involving a smart city's
   ontology and different types of agents were conducted to validate the
   usefulness of OntoPhil in the smart city environment.}},

Abstract = {{A smart city application has been realized and tested. It is a fully
   remote controlled isle of lamp posts based on new technologies. It has
   been designed and organized in different hierarchical layers, which
   perform local activities to physically control the lamp posts and
   transmit information with another for remote control. Locally, each lamp
   post uses an electronic card for management and a ZigBee tlc network
   transmits data to a central control unit, which manages the whole isle.
   The central unit is realized with a Raspberry-Pi control card due to its
   good computing performance at very low price. Finally, a WiMAX
   connection was tested and used to remotely control the smart grid, thus
   overcoming the distance limitations of commercial Wi-Fi networks. The
   isle has been realized and tested for some months in the field.}},

Abstract = {{A number of accessible RDF stores are populating the linked open data
   world. The navigation on data reticular relationships is becoming every
   day more relevant. Several knowledge base present relevant links to
   common vocabularies while many others are going to be discovered
   increasing the reasoning capabilities of our knowledge base
   applications. In this paper, the Linked Open Graph, LOG, is presented.
   It is a web tool for collaborative browsing and navigation on multiple
   SPARQL entry points. The paper presented an overview of major problems
   to be addressed, a comparison with the state of the arts tools, and some
   details about the LOG graph computation to cope with high complexity of
   large Linked Open Dada graphs. The LOG.disit.org tool is also presented
   by means of a set of examples involving multiple RDF stores and putting
   in evidence the new provided features and advantages using dbPedia,
   Getty, Europeana, Geonames, etc. The LOG tool is free to be used, and it
   has been adopted, developed and/or improved in multiple projects: such
   as ECLAP for social media cultural heritage, Sii-Mobility for smart
   city, and ICARO for cloud ontology analysis, OSIM for
   competence/knowledge mining and analysis. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Presently, a very large number of public and private data sets are
   available from local governments. In most cases, they are not
   semantically interoperable and a huge human effort would be needed to
   create integrated ontologies and knowledge base for smart city. Smart
   City ontology is not yet standardized, and a lot of research work is
   needed to identify models that can easily support the data
   reconciliation, the management of the complexity, to allow the data
   reasoning. In this paper, a system for data ingestion and reconciliation
   of smart cities related aspects as road graph, services available on the
   roads, traffic sensors etc., is proposed. The system allows managing a
   big data volume of data coming from a variety of sources considering
   both static and dynamic data. These data are mapped to a smart-city
   ontology, called KM4City (Knowledge Model for City), and stored into an
   RDF-Store where they are available for applications via SPARQL queries
   to provide new services to the users via specific applications of public
   administration and enterprises. The paper presents the process adopted
   to produce the ontology and the big data architecture for the knowledge
   base feeding on the basis of open and private data, and the mechanisms
   adopted for the data verification, reconciliation and validation. Some
   examples about the possible usage of the coherent big data knowledge
   base produced are also offered and are accessible from the RDF-store and
   related services. The article also presented the work performed about
   reconciliation algorithms and their comparative assessment and
   selection. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The recent availability of datasets on transportation networks with

   activities in the fields of Territorial Intelligence and Smart Cities.
   Among these, many research efforts are aimed at predicting traffic
   congestions to alleviate their negative effects on society, mainly by
   learning recurring mobility patterns. Within this field, in this paper
   we propose an integrated solution to predict and visualize non-recurring
   traffic congestion in urban environments caused by Planned Special
   Events (PSE), such as a soccer game or a concert. Predictions are done
   by means of two Machine Learning-based techniques. These have been
   proven to successfully outperform current state of the art predictions
   by 35\% in an empirical assessment we conducted over a time frame of 7
   months within the inner city of Cologne, Germany. The predicted
   congestions are fed into a specifically conceived visualization tool we
   designed to allow Decision Makers to evaluate the situation and take
   actions to improve mobility. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we analyze the current situation of education in
   universities, with particular reference to the European scenario.
   Specifically, we observe that recent evolutions, such as pervasive
   networking and other enabling technologies, have been dramatically
   changing human life, knowledge acquisition, and the way works are
   performed and people learn. In this societal change, universities must
   maintain their leading role. Historically, they set trends primarily in
   education but now they are called to drive the change in other aspects
   too, such as management, safety, and environment protection. The
   availability of newer and newer technology reflects on how the relevant
   processes should be performed in the current fast changing digital era.
   This leads to the adoption of a variety of smart solutions in university
   environments to enhance the quality of life and to improve the
   performances of both teachers and students. Nevertheless, we argue that
   being smart is not enough for a modern university. In fact, universities
   should better become smarter. By ``smarter university{''} we mean a
   place where knowledge is shared between employees, teachers, students,
   and all stakeholders in a seamless way. In this paper we propose, and
   discuss a smarter university model, derived from the one designed for
   the development of smart cities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Real-time coordinated traffic management strategies that benefit from
   parsimonious models with aggregated network dynamics, provide a new
   generation of smart hierarchical strategies to improve network capacity
   and performance. However, this raises the question of route choice
   behavior in case of heterogeneous urban networks, where different parts
   of the city are subject to different types of control. Traffic
   equilibrium phenomena have not been thoroughly investigated in these
   models. Approximate traffic equilibrium conditions can be integrated
   within the parsimonious traffic models to develop regional routing
   strategies, while detailed route choice strategies can be incorporated
   at a later stage in a hierarchical framework. In this study, we develop
   an aggregated and approximate dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) procedure
   to be incorporated in the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD)
   dynamics, and establish dynamic stochastic user equilibrium (DSUE)
   conditions. The methodology consists of two main components; stochastic
   network loading and a fixed-point solution method. Loading procedure is
   designed to handle stochastic components in the model such as trip
   length uncertainty, variation of speeds across the links, perception
   error of travelers. The results taken from this procedure are averaged
   through the well-known method of successive averages (MSA) to reach
   fixed-point solution for the system. Real-time route guidance strategies
   can be revisited towards a ``system of systems{''} approach. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In a short period of time Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) captured the
   imagination of many researchers with the number of applications growing
   rapidly. The applications span large domains including mobile digital
   health, structural and environmental monitoring, smart home, energy
   efficient buildings, agriculture, smart cities, etc WSN are also an
   important contributor to the fast emerging Internet of Things
   infrastructure. Some of the design specifications for WSN include
   reliability, accuracy, cost, deployment versatility, power consumption,
   etc. Power consumption is (most often) the dominant constraint in
   designing such systems. This constraint has multi-dimensional
   implications such as battery type and size, energy harvester design,
   lifetime of the deployment, intelligent sensing capability, etc. Power
   optimization techniques have to explore a large design search space.
   Energy neutral system implementation is the ultimate goal in wireless
   sensor networks ensuring a perpetual/greener use and represents a hot
   topic of research. Several recent advances promise significant reduction
   of the overall sensor network power consumption. These advances include
   novel sensors and sensor interfaces, low energy wireless transceivers,
   low power processing, efficient energy harvesters, etc. This paper
   reviews a number of system level power management methodologies for
   Wireless Sensor Networks. Especially, the paper is focusing on the
   promising technology of nano Watt wake-up radio receiver and its
   combination with mature power management techniques to achieve better
   performance. Some of the presented techniques are then applied in the
   context of low cost and battery powered toy robots. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Transportation activity surveys collect the travel behavior of people,
   including when, where, and how they travel for urban planning purposes.
   Traditionally, transportation activity surveys are carried out using
   conventional questionaires, which are labor intensive and error prone.
   In this paper, we have developed a smartphone-based mobility sensing
   system, called UrbanMobilitySense, which captures human mobility
   information automatically to conduct transportation activity surveys.
   The UrbanMobilitySense system was designed to address two critical
   issues: 1) energy conservation and 2) privacy preservation. To optimize
   the energy utilization of smartphone, we avoid using the GPS sensor when
   the user is at long-stay places and filter out redundant data before
   data uploading. To preserve personal privacy, each smartphone maintains
   the user's long-stay places by two separate profiles: 1) private place
   profile and 2) public place profile. The former maintains the
   privacy-preserved places (e. g., home), whereas the latter maintains the
   public places (e. g., parks). We implement the UrbanMobilitySense system
   to conduct real-world transportation activity surveys, study the
   performance of our system through extensive experiments, and analyze the
   computational complexity of the proposed algorithms. The outcome of our
   work has been deployed in Singapore to support the Land Transport
   Authority's transportation activity surveys.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread availability of smartphones today equipped with several
   physical and virtual sensors allows to directly collect various
   information about surrounding physical and logical context for different
   purposes that range from detecting user's current physical activity and
   also user presence in a designated area, often referred to as
   geofencing, to determining current social pulse of individuals and
   entire communities. Mobile crowdsensing seems a promising solution for
   enabling the design/development and deployment of a wide range of
   advanced applications in various fields. In particular, public safety,
   transportation, and energy monitoring and management in urban
   environments can benefit from mobile crowdsensing in terms of advanced
   provisioned applications as well as savings of investments in the urban
   sensing infrastructure. However, enabling those advanced smart urban
   applications requires complex signal processing, machine learning, and
   resource management algorithms that are often beyond the skills of many
   mobile app developers. This paper describes the pivotal relevance of
   these facilities for mobile crowdsensing applications and presents our
   open-source solution, called Mobile Sensing Technology (MoST), for
   activity detection and geofencing, comparing it with the reference
   implementations provided by Google as part of the Google Play Services
   library. Experimental results within the testbed framework of a
   crowd-management application scenario validate MoST design guidelines
   and demonstrate the general-purpose, unintrusive, and power-efficient
   characteristics of MoST sensing capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{This research is particularly concerned with public policy instruments
   which may help to accelerate the development and diffusion of
   sustainable innovations and support local economic development. While
   sustainable technology sectors are in high demand, firms still face
   significant barriers in developing and diffusing their technologies in
   regions throughout the world (Hoff, 2012). This area has been less
   explored in the extant research yet recent experiences suggest that
   supply side tools may not always have positive benefits for supporting
   clean technology evolution, or for taxpayers. Leveraging innovation
   policy and technology life cycle literature, we develop a model of
   demand-side policy instruments which could be applied at different
   stages of the technology s-curve in order to accelerate the adoption of
   sustainable technologies. Implications for managers, public policy
   actors and researchers are considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Now-a-days advances in mobile device technology aim to build complex
   computational systems providing a maximum level of flexibility,
   decentralization, simplest form of interactivity, and ease of use.
   Recently, the launch of the agent-oriented platform JaCaMo and its
   Android client based platform JaCa-Android have provided an appropriate
   level of abstraction to build smart mobile client server systems
   providing these attributes. By using these platforms, we have developed
   a multi-agent based Smart Mobile Virtual Community Management System
   (SMVCMS) that makes it possible to provide a decentralized and open
   management of virtual communities. This paper addresses the design and
   architecture of our multi-agent server and client application. It
   elaborates different features of our system; such as how a participant
   in virtual communities is supported by a Jason agent that encapsulates
   the logic and the control of the participation in a virtual community
   (such as publishing posts, notifying members, making recommendations for
   the user, etc.). It also discusses how the set of CArtAgO artifacts
   provides the basic functionalities and operations giving access to the
   functionalities for knowledge exchange in virtual communities, and
   personal agents onAndroid exploit these artifacts to execute their tasks
   while achieving their individual and collective goals. We have employed
   SMVCMS in the context of Smart Cities and found that the system fulfills
   the desired goals, such as decentralization of community management,
   personalized automatic management and discovery of communities, autonomy
   of agents and flexibility so that any agent can create its own community
   with the maximum level of ease.}},

Abstract = {{Cities need to constantly monitor weather to anticipate heavy storm
   events and reduce the impact of floods. Information describing
   precipitation and ground conditions at high spatio-temporal resolution
   is essential for taking timely action and preventing damages.
   Traditionally, rain gauges and weather radars are used to monitor rain
   events, but these sources provide low spatial resolutions and are
   subject to inaccuracy. Therefore, information needs to be complemented
   with data from other sources: from citizens' phone calls to the
   authorities, to relevant online media posts, which have the potential of
   providing timely and valuable information on weather conditions in the
   city. This information is often scattered through different, static, and
   not-publicly available databases. This makes it impossible to use it in
   an aggregate, standard way, and therefore hampers efficiency of
   emergency response. In this paper, we describe information sources
   relating to a heavy rain event in Rotterdam on October 12-14, 2013.
   Rotterdam weather monitoring infrastructure is composed of a number of
   rain gauges installed at different locations in the city, as well as a
   weather radar network. This sensing network is currently scarcely
   integrated and logged data are not easily accessible during an
   emergency. Therefore, we propose a reliable, efficient, and low-cost ICT
   infrastructure that takes information from all relevant sources,
   including sensors as well as social and user contributed information and
   integrates them into a unique, cloud-based interface. The proposed
   infrastructure will improve efficiency in emergency responses to extreme
   weather events and, ultimately, guarantee more safety to the urban
   population.}},

Abstract = {{With the latest developments in cloud computing and Internet of Vehicles
   (IoV), now it is possible to construct an efficient next generation
   infrastructure, which may act as an interface for the connection of a
   number of objects such as vehicles, intelligent sensors, actuators, home
   appliances, high-computing servers, and computers to the Internet. In
   such an environment, vehicles on the road may act as source provider or
   consumer to facilitate various users connected to the Internet. Content
   distribution to all these objects especially to the vehicles in this
   environment is a challenging task due to the tight constraints of
   maintaining connectivity, coverage, and topology of the vehicles. To
   address these issues, in this paper, we proposed a new Bayesian
   coalition game (BCG) as-a-service for content distribution among these
   objects using support from cloud. We have addressed the problem of
   content distribution to vehicles from the perspective of BCG and
   learning automata (LA). Content are assumed to be located at the cloud,
   which is accessed by the vehicles through Internet even on-the-fly.
   Vehicles are assumed to be the players in the game and form a coalition
   among themselves using Markov decision process (MDP). For each action
   taken by an automaton, it may get a reward or a penalty from the
   environment according to which it updates its action probability vector.
   The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated be selecting various
   parameters. The results obtained show that proposed scheme is effective
   in building next generation IoV environment.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things paradigm envisions the pervasive interconnection
   and cooperation of smart things over the current and future Internet
   infrastructure. The Internet of Things is, thus, the evolution of the
   Internet to cover the real world, enabling many new services that will
   improve people's everyday lives, spawn new businesses, and make
   buildings, cities, and transport smarter. Smart things allow indeed for
   ubiquitous data collection or tracking, but these useful features are
   also examples of privacy threats that are already now limiting the
   success of the Internet of Things vision when not implemented correctly.
   These threats involve new challenges such as the pervasive privacy-aware
   management of personal data or methods to control or avoid ubiquitous
   tracking and profiling. This paper analyzes the privacy issues in the
   Internet of Things in detail. To this end, we first discuss the evolving
   features and trends in the Internet of Things with the goal of
   scrutinizing their privacy implications. Second, we classify and examine
   privacy threats in this new setting, pointing out the challenges that
   need to be overcome to ensure that the Internet of Things becomes a

Abstract = {{This survey paper is an excerpt of a more comprehensive study on Smart
   Grid (SG) and the role of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in SG.
   The survey was carried out as part of a feasibility study for creation
   of a Net-Zero community in a city in Ontario, Canada. SG is not a single
   technology; rather it is a combination of different areas of
   engineering, communication and management. This paper introduces AMI
   technology and its current status, as the foundation of SG, which is
   responsible for collecting all the data and information from loads and
   consumers. AMI is also responsible for implementing control signals and
   commands to perform necessary control actions as well as Demand Side
   Management (DSM). In this paper we introduce SG and its features,
   establish the relation between SG and AMI, explain the three main
   subsystems of AMI and discuss related security issues. Crown Copyright

   focuses on the energy consumption and management services that smart
   homes offer. However, they can deliver much broader types of services,
   including assisted living, health and security. By including these
   non-energy aspects, this paper reveals differences in perceptions of
   smart homes in a cross-country comparative context to inform the
   delivery of smart home services. Public perceptions on the role of
   utilities and government in particular are important factors to be taken
   into account. The research highlights that policies should leave all
   paths open due to due to differences in householder preferences and
   acceptance of smart homes. Further implications for service delivery and
   planning are highlighted, calling for more interdisciplinary research in
   this area.}},

Abstract = {{The tremendous growth of low power wireless technologies oriented to
   smart city applications has conduced to evaluate the propagation aspects
   under typical communication scenarios in urban environments where in
   contrast to cellular technologies the transmitter and or the receiver
   antenna can be deployed at different heights near ground. Thus, the
   authors introduce a unified empiric parametrised propagation model with
   validated parameters from the measurements to study the propagation
   characteristics in near-ground scenarios. The proposed model considers
   the antenna's height as well as external power losses because of objects
   that may block the line-of-sight to the receiver. The main results of
   this research demonstrate that in near-ground wireless links, the
   wireless range is severely reduced because of diffraction caused by
   ground. However, in scenarios where the receiver is always higher than
   the transmitter the diffraction is null and the path loss slope is less
   than free space, with the consequence of a considerably higher wireless
   range. The propagation model presented here is a valuable tool for
   network planning where typical cellular propagation models might not be
   appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{As more and more users access social network services from smart devices
   with GPS receivers, the available amount of geo-tagged information makes
   repeating classical experiments possible on global scales and with
   unprecedented precision. Inspired by the original experiments of
   Milgram, we simulated message routing within a representative sub-graph
   of the network of Twitter users with about 6 million geo-located nodes
   and 122 million edges. We picked pairs of users from two distant
   metropolitan areas and tried to find a route between them using local
   geographic information only; our method was to forward messages to a
   friend living closest to the target. We found that the examined network
   is navigable on large scales, but navigability breaks down at the city
   scale and the network becomes unnavigable on intra-city distances. This
   means that messages usually arrived to the close proximity of the target
   in only 3-6 steps, but only in about 20\% of the cases was it possible
   to find a route all the way to the recipient, in spite of the network
   being connected. This phenomenon is supported by the distribution of
   link lengths; on larger scales the distribution behaves approximately as
   P(d) similar to 1/d, which was found earlier by Kleinberg to allow
   efficient navigation, while on smaller scales, a fractal structure
   becomes apparent. The intra-city correlation dimension of the network
   was found to be D-2 = 1.25, less than the dimension D-2 = 1.78 of the
   distribution of the population.}},

Abstract = {{Urban spatial structure in large cities is becoming ever more complex as
   populations grow in size, engage in more travel, and have increasing
   amounts of disposable income that enable them to live more diverse
   lifestyles. These trends have prominent and visible effects on urban
   activity, and cities are becoming more polycentric in their structure as
   new clusters and hotspots emerge and coalesce in a wider sea of urban
   development. Here, we apply recent methods in network science and their
   generalization to spatial analysis to identify the spatial structure of
   city hubs, centers, and borders, which are essential elements in
   understanding urban interactions. We use a `big' data set for Singapore
   from the automatic smart card fare collection system, which is available
   for sample periods in 2010, 2011, and 2012 to show how the changing
   roles and influences of local areas in the overall spatial structure of
   urban movement can be efficiently monitored from daily transportation.
   In essence, we first construct a weighted directed graph from these
   travel records. Each node in the graph denotes an urban area, edges
   denote the possibility of travel between any two areas, and the weight
   of edges denotes the volume of travel, which is the number of trips
   made. We then make use of (a) the graph properties to obtain an overall
   view of travel demand, (b) graph centralities for detecting urban
   centers and hubs, and (c) graph community structures for uncovering
   socioeconomic clusters defined as neighborhoods and their borders.
   Finally, results of this network analysis are projected back onto
   geographical space to reveal the spatial structure of urban movements.
   The revealed community structure shows a clear subdivision into
   different areas that separate the population's activity space into
   smaller neighborhoods. The generated borders are different from existing
   administrative ones. By comparing the results from 3years of data, we
   find that Singapore, even from such a short time series, is developing
   rapidly towards a polycentric urban form, where new subcenters and
   communities are emerging largely in line with the city's master plan.
   To summarize, our approach yields important insights into urban
   phenomena generated by human movements. It represents a quantitative
   approach to urban analysis, which explicitly identifies ongoing urban
   transformations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The mechanisms associated with the cardiovascular
   consequences of obstructive sleep apnea include abrupt changes in
   autonomic tone, which can trigger cardiac arrhythmias. The authors
   hypothesized that nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia occurs more frequently in
   patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
   Objective: To analyze the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea
   and abnormal heart rhythm during sleep in a population sample.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study with 1,101 volunteers, who form a
   representative sample of the city of Sao Paulo. The overnight
   polysomnography was performed using an EMBLA (R) S7000 digital system
   during the regular sleep schedule of the individual. The
   electrocardiogram channel was extracted, duplicated, and then analyzed
   using a Holter (Cardio Smart (R)) system.
   Results: A total of 767 participants (461 men) with a mean age of 42.00
   +/- 0.53 years, were included in the analysis. At least one type of
   nocturnal cardiac rhythm disturbance (atrial/ventricular arrhythmia or
   beat) was observed in 62.7\% of the sample. The occurrence of nocturnal
   cardiac arrhythmias was more frequent with increased disease severity.
   Rhythm disturbance was observed in 53.3\% of the sample without
   breathing sleep disorders, whereas 92.3\% of patients with severe
   obstructive sleep apnea showed cardiac arrhythmia. Isolated atrial and
   ventricular ectopy was more frequent in patients with moderate/severe
   obstructive sleep apnea when compared to controls (p < 0.001). After
   controlling for potential confounding factors, age, sex and
   apnea-hypopnea index were associated with nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia.
   Conclusion: Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmia occurs more frequently in
   patients with obstructive sleep apnea and the prevalence increases with
   disease severity. Age, sex, and the Apnea-hypopnea index were predictors
   of arrhythmia in this sample.}},

Abstract = {{This work proposes an embedded system that opportunistically detects
   free on-street parking by using surveillance cameras. Intelligent boards
   are embedded in the cameras allowing a distributed processing and
   communication. The task of looking for free parking spaces demands a
   significant amount of drivers' time. This problem generally takes place
   in urban areas where there is a large number of vehicles and few
   available parking spaces (on-street or off-street). Decreasing the time
   spent in this task could reduce the traffic jam or, in an extreme
   perspective, alleviate the toxic gases emission or the fossil
   combustible consumption. Initially, it was evaluated three classical
   techniques for image processing applied to detect free on-street
   parking. The best one presents a success detection rate close to 100\%.
   After that, it was evaluated the performance of the embedded system by
   using only the best image processing technique. This performance
   evaluation considers three different scenarios: centralized, hybrid, and
   embedded. The last one is the main proposal and contribution. The
   results reveal that embedded proposal had an average requisition time of
   2.10 s vs. 0.38 s of centralized one. The hybrid one presents the worst
   results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All.rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing in the ranks among the global cities is a top priority not
   only for the city officials but also for the central governments. With
   the prevalent use of the information and communication technologies
   (ICTs), local governments and cities strive to make the best use of the
   newly emerging technologies. Many cities aspire to create smart,
   connected and intelligent environments. Although companies such as IBM,
   CISCO, Siemens, and Ericsson are offering latest ICT products to cities,
   technology as a standalone entity cannot flourish without a close
   cooperation at the macro (country) level. In this paper, we identify the
   significant factors that contribute to creating global cities, and
   analyze where and how ICTs make an impact for each dimension of success.
   Overall, the results demonstrate the crucial roles ICTs play in
   achieving success. The findings also emphasize that cooperation between
   central and local government is imperative in order to form globally
   successful cities. Our findings have implications on governors, city and
   country level technology managers and macro-level government officials.

Abstract = {{This study aims to shed light on the process of building an effective
   smart city by integrating various practical perspectives with a
   consideration of smart city characteristics taken from the literature.
   We developed a framework for conducting case studies examining how smart
   cities were being implemented in San Francisco and Seoul Metropolitan
   City. The study's empirical results suggest that effective, sustainable
   smart cities emerge as a result of dynamic processes in which public and
   private sector actors coordinate their activities and resources on an
   open innovation platform. The different yet complementary linkages
   formed by these actors must further be aligned with respect to their
   developmental stage and embedded cultural and social capabilities. Our
   findings point to eight `stylized facts', based on both quantitative and
   qualitative empirical results that underlie the facilitation of an
   effective smart city. In elaborating these facts, the paper offers
   useful insights to managers seeking to improve the delivery of smart

Abstract = {{Ambitious eco-city initiatives of the 21st century are commonly branded
   as carbon-neutral, low-carbon, smart-eco, sustainable, ubiquitous-eco
   and zero-carbon emphasising their sustainability niches. This study
   focuses on one of these brands-ubiquitous-eco-city (u-eco-city). The
   principal premise of a u-eco-city is to provide a high quality of life
   and place to residents, workers and visitors with low-to-no negative
   impacts on the natural environment with support from the
   state-of-the-art technologies in their planning, development and
   management. The paper aims to put this premise into a test and address
   whether u-eco-city is a dazzling smart and sustainable urban form that
   constitutes an ideal 21st century city model or just a branding hoax.
   It, first, explores the recent developments and trends in ubiquitous
   technologies, infrastructures, services and management systems, and
   their utilisation and implications for the development of u-eco-cities.
   It, then, places Korean u-eco-city initiatives under the microscope, and
   critically discusses their prospects in forming a smart and sustainable
   urban form and becoming an ideal city model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{262-272}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Could smart city technology be considered as a strategic option for
   firms, especially in recession conditions? Most prior smart city studies
   focus on the nature and impact of technological systems adopted in the
   context of particular urban conditions. At the same time, studies about
   recessions examine primarily their reasons and consequences. Currently,
   there is no research examining the role of city technology as a
   strategic option for firms in a recession environment. To address this
   gap we develop a conceptual framework from studies of recessions and
   examine the case study of the IBM Smarter Cities initiative against this
   framework. Our case builds on interview and archival data. Our study
   offers two contributions. First, we offer an empirical examination of
   city technology from the perspective of stakeholders and actors who are
   tasked with the role to create and disseminate these technologies
   instead of the perspective of cities that use the technology. Second, we
   propose a strategic view to city technology and showcase the distinctive
   theoretical and empirical insights that future studies can develop by
   shifting the attention on the processes and practices inside the ICT
   organisations creating and disseminating these city technologies. (C)

Abstract = {{The continuous expansion of consumer-driven installations of residential
   rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems causes serious power quality, notable
   voltage variations and unbalance, which limit the number and capacity of
   the further connections. The latent reactive power capability of PV
   inverters can increase the network PV hosting capability. This study
   proposes both reactive power control and real power curtailment as a
   comprehensive inverter control strategy to improve the operating
   performance of unbalanced three-phase four-wire low voltage distribution
   networks with high penetrations of residential PV systems. A
   multi-objective optimal power flow (OPF) problem that can simultaneously
   improve voltage magnitude and balance profiles while minimising network
   loss and generation costs is defined. The solution is found using the
   global solver based on Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm with
   multiple starting points in Matlab. Detailed simulations are performed
   and analysed for typical operating scenarios over 24-h period on a real
   three-phase four-wire unbalanced distribution network in Perth Solar
   City trial, Australia. Smart meter readings are used to justify the

Abstract = {{Investing in smart grid infrastructure is a key enabler for the
   transition to low carbon energy systems. Recent work has characterised
   the costs and benefits of individual ``smart{''} investments. The
   political economy of the UK electricity system, however, has co-evolved
   such that there is a mismatch between where benefits accrue and where
   costs are incurred, leading to a problem of value capture and
   redeployment. Further, some benefits of smart grids are less easy to
   price directly and can be classified as public goods, such as energy
   security and decarbonisation. This paper builds on systemic treatments
   of energy system transitions to characterise the co-evolution of value
   capture and structural incentives in the electricity distribution
   system, drawing on semi-structured interviews and focus groups
   undertaken with smart grid stakeholders in the UK. This leads to an
   identification of municipal scale values that may be important for
   business models for the delivery of smart infrastructure. Municipalities
   may thus pursue specific economic opportunities through smart grid
   investment. This supports recent practical interest in an expanded role
   for municipalities as partners and investors in smart grid
   infrastructures. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This

   represents the environment for sophisticated control and energy
   management algorithms that can be tested on the platform. The concept of
   this work is to combine commercial-off-the-shelf software packages, here
   simulators and runtime infrastructure (RTI), to a high performance
   multidomain cosimulation platform. The high performance of the platform
   regarding computation time has been achieved by exploiting the parallel
   computing capabilities of modern simulation servers. Especially the
   computation time of large numbers of instances of Modelica-based models
   has been reduced significantly by the development of the parallel
   execution framework (PEF). The implementation of the PEF, including the
   interface to the individual models and to the RTI, is described in
   detail. The partitioning of the simulated system among different
   simulators does not influence the simulation results, as shown on the
   basis of a small-scale simulation scenario. The performance regarding
   the computation time is demonstrated on several example simulation
   scenarios showing the scalability of the platform.}},

Abstract = {{In this study a microclimate analysis on a particular urban

   conducted by performing numerical simulations using the finite volumes

   This analysis can be helpful in the study on urban microclimate and on
   the heat exchanges with the buildings. Fluid-dynamic fields on vertical
   planes within the canyon, have been evaluated. The results show the
   importance of the geometrical configuration, in relation to the ratio
   between the height (H) of the buildings and the width (W) of the road.
   This is a very important subject from the point of view of ``Smart

Abstract = {{To enhance environmental sustainability, many countries will electrify
   their transportation systems in their future smart city plans, so the
   number of electric vehicles (EVs) running in a city will grow
   significantly. There are many ways to recharge EVs' batteries and
   charging stations will be considered as the main source of energy. The
   locations of charging stations are critical; they should not only be
   pervasive enough such that an EV anywhere can easily access a charging
   station within its driving range, but also widely spread so that EVs can
   cruise around the whole city upon being recharged. Based on these new
   perspectives, we formulate the EV charging station placement problem
   (EVCSPP) in this paper. We prove that the problem is nondeterministic
   polynomial-time hard. We also propose four solution methods to tackle
   EVCSPP, and evaluate their performance on various artificial and
   practical cases. As verified by the simulation results, the methods have
   their own characteristics and they are suitable for different situations
   depending on the requirements for solution quality, algorithmic
   efficiency, problem size, nature of the algorithm, and existence of
   system prerequisite.}},

Abstract = {{In the design phase of business collaboration, it is desirable to be
   able to predict the profitability of the business-to-be. Therefore,
   techniques to assess qualities such as costs, revenues, risks, and
   profitability have been previously proposed. However, they do not allow
   the modeler to properly manage uncertainty with respect to the design of
   the considered business collaboration. In many real collaboration
   projects today, uncertainty regarding the business' present or future
   characteristics is so significant that ignoring it becomes problematic.
   In this paper, we propose an approach based on the predictive,
   probabilistic architecture modeling framework (P(2)AMF), capable of
   advanced and probabilistically sound reasoning about profitability
   risks. The P(2)AMF-based approach for profitability risk prediction is
   also based on the e(3)-value modeling language and on the object
   constraint language. The paper introduces the prediction and modeling
   approach, and a supporting software tool. The use of the approach is
   illustrated by means of a case study originated from the Stockholm Royal
   Seaport smart city project.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an innovative approach to solve one of the most
   relevant problems related to smart mobility: the reduction of vehicles'
   travel time. Our original approach, called Red Swarm, suggests a
   potentially customized route to each vehicle by using several spots
   located at traffic lights in order to avoid traffic jams by using V2I
   communications. That is quite different from other existing proposals,
   as it deals with real maps and actual streets, as well as several road
   traffic distributions. We propose an evolutionary algorithm (later
   efficiently parallelized) to optimize our case studies which have been
   imported from OpenStreetMap into SUMO as they belong to a real city. We
   have also developed a Rerouting Algorithm which accesses the
   configuration of the Red Swarm and communicates the route chosen to
   vehicles, using the spots (via WiFi link). Moreover, we have developed
   three competing algorithms in order to compare their results to those of
   Red Swarm and have observed that Red Swarm not only achieved the best
   results, but also outperformed the experts' solutions in a total of 60
   scenarios tested, with up to 19\% shorter travel times. (C) 2014

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cities are complex systems. They contain different functional areas
   originally defined by planning and then reshaped by actual needs and use
   by the inhabitants. Estimating the functions of urban space is of
   significant importance for detecting urban problems, evaluating planning
   strategies, and supporting policy making. In light of the potential of
   data mining and spatial analysis techniques for urban analysis, this
   paper proposes a method to infer urban functions at the building level
   using transportation data obtained from surveys and smart card systems.
   Specifically, we establish a two-step framework making use of the
   spatial relationships between trips, stops, and buildings. Firstly,
   information about the travel purposes for daily activities is deduced
   using passengers' mobility patterns based on a probabilistic Bayesian
   model. Secondly, building functions are inferred by linking daily
   activities to the buildings surrounding the stops based on spatial
   statistics. We demonstrate the proposed method using large-scale public
   transportation data from two areas of Singapore. Our method is applied
   to identify building functions at building level. The result is verified
   with master plan, street view, and investigated data, and limitations
   are identified. Our work shows that the presented method is applicable
   in practice with a good accuracy. In a broader context, it shows the
   effectiveness of applying integrated techniques to combine multi-source
   data in order to make insights about social activities and complex urban
   space. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   enabling the simulation of load shifting caused by the operation of
   residential energy management systems.
   A simulation of an hypothetical 20\% deployment of a residential energy

   development. Current trends for traffic control are based on the use of
   smart traffic lights and signals as a part of smart cities' projects.
   Different cities are currently involved in the design and implementation
   of smart traffic control. Since the cost of physically installing these
   systems is very high, in terms of both money and resources,
   accelerated-time simulations of traffic flow using smart traffic lights
   and signals significantly reduce these costs.
   In this work we present a new model for accelerated-time simulations for
   traffic flow within. The philosophy of this model is based on previous
   works of the authors, where accelerated-time simulations for car traffic
   in a motorway or a roundabout and baggage traffic in an airport were
   developed. The philosophy of this model combines ideas from cellular
   automata and neural network theories, obtaining a mixed model.
   This system was developed using a Computer Algebra System (CAS) called
   MAXIMA for mathematical computations and a JAVA based interface for
   graphical display. MAXIMA allows the system to support the use of ad hoc
   distribution functions for the different events dealt with in the
   simulations. The interface provides a friendly framework for entering
   input data and visualizing the simulations, providing also some
   statistical data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   This paper discusses the results of the Designing Policy project, which
   engages current debates about urban technology through the creation of a
   visual toolkit and a series of workshops. The workshops were held in
   Chicago, New York, and Boston during 2012-2013 with funding from the
   Urban Communication Foundation. The purpose of the project was
   three-fold: (1) to open up the ``black box{''} of urban technology in
   order to reveal the politics embedded in city infrastructures; (2) to
   move beyond discussions of urban problems and solutions, and towards a
   more conceptual future-oriented space; and (3) to explore the use of
   design methods such as visual prototypes and participatory design. This
   article introduces the concept of design friction as a way of
   understanding the ways in which conflicts, tensions and disagreements
   can move complex socio-technical discussions forward where they can be
   worked out through material engagement in hands-on prototyping.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the widespread availability of smartphones provided
   with sensors has enabled the possibility of harvesting large quantities
   of data in urban areas exploiting user devices, thus enabling so-called
   mobile crowd sensing (MCS). While many efforts have been made to improve
   specific techniques for MCS - spanning from signal processing to the
   assignment of data collection campaigns to users, and to the entire data
   processing spectrum - to the best of our knowledge, thus far there have
   been no active experiments of MCS that involve all these techniques in a
   large-scale real-world experiment. Based on these considerations, we
   started the ParticipAct Living Lab testbed, an ongoing experiment at the
   University of Bologna involving 300 students for one year in crowd
   sensing campaigns that can passively access smartphone sensors and also
   require active user collaboration. In this article we describe the
   guidelines behind the design of ParticipAct, as well as its features and
   architecture. Moreover, we report some of the seminal results gathered
   during the first three months of its deployment, including accuracy of
   the classifier provided by ParticipAct client and user inclination to
   successfully complete tasks depending on the level of active
   collaboration required to executing them.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a multi-modal 2D + 3D face recognition method
   for a smart city application based on a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)
   and various kinds of sensors. Depth maps are exploited for the 3D face
   representation. As for feature extraction, we propose a new feature
   called Complete Local Derivative Pattern (CLDP). It adopts the idea of
   layering and has four layers. In the whole system, we apply CLDP
   separately on Gabor features extracted from a 2D image and depth map.
   Then, we obtain two features: CLDP-Gabor and CLDP-Depth. The two
   features weighted by the corresponding coefficients are combined
   together in the decision level to compute the total classification
   distance. At last, the probe face is assigned the identity with the
   smallest classification distance. Extensive experiments are conducted on
   three different databases. The results demonstrate the robustness and
   superiority of the new approach. The experimental results also prove
   that the proposed multi-modal 2D + 3D method is superior to other
   multi-modal ones and CLDP performs better than other Local Binary
   Pattern (LBP) based features.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing concerns on environment and natural resources, coupled with
   increasing demand for transport, put lots of pressure for improved
   efficiency and performance on transport systems worldwide. New
   technology nowadays enables fast innovation in transport, but it is the
   policy for deployment and operation with a systems perspective that
   often determines success. Smart traffic management has played important
   roles for continuous development of traffic systems especially in urban
   areas. There is, however, still lack of effort in current traffic
   management and planning practice prioritizing policy goals in
   environment and energy. This paper presents an application of a
   model-based framework to quantify environmental impacts and fuel
   efficiency of road traffic, and to evaluate optimal signal plans with
   respect not only to traffic mobility performance but also other
   important measures for sustainability. Microscopic traffic simulator is
   integrated with micro-scale emission model for estimation of emissions
   and fuel consumption at high resolution. A stochastic optimization
   engine is implemented to facilitate optimal signal planning for
   different policy goals, including delay, stop-and-goes, fuel economy
   etc. In order to enhance the validity of the modeling framework, both
   traffic and emission models are fine-tuned using data collected in a
   Chinese city. In addition, two microscopic traffic models are applied,
   and lead to consistent results for signal optimization. Two control
   schemes, fixed time and vehicle actuated, are optimized while multiple
   performance indexes are analyzed and compared for corresponding
   objectives. Solutions, representing compromise between different
   policies, are also obtained in the case study by optimizing an
   integrated performance index. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Smart homes are about to become reality, involving technology such as
   Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), which enables querying for
   extended product information from the manufacturer or from public
   databases. However, every query for information issued from a smart home
   could adversely affect the privacy of its inhabitants. Since every
   Electronic Product Code assigned to RFID-equipped objects is unique, it
   is easily possible to create detailed and long-term customer profiles by
   linking queries on particular items to a specific person. In order to
   address the privacy problem, this paper proposes a novel peer-to-peer
   (P2P) infrastructure for organized sharing and private querying of data,
   which is formed by many smart devices across several homes. The
   efficiency of this approach is examined with experiments involving
   several hundred nodes. Furthermore, larger peer-to-peer networks of
   smart home appliances are simulated. According to our evaluation, the
   proposed solution is able to satisfy real-time requirements in settings
   where smart devices are geographically close. Moreover, the architecture
   can be used to store information of nearly one million different
   products within a network of one thousand nodes, which is a reasonable
   size for a local collaborative infrastructure between smart homes in
   towns or cities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Integration of distributed generation in the power distribution network:
   The need for smart grid control systems, communication and equipment for
   a smart city - Use cases}},

Abstract = {{The exploitation of renewable energy resources poses great challenges
   regarding the manner in which they can be integrated into the modern
   electrical distribution infrastructure.
   To understand the difficulties of integration of Distributed Generation
   (DG) in electricity distribution network, the analyses and result of the
   effects on aspects of power quality are provided, as can be the problem
   of failure defects in networks and how DG grid connection affects
   voltage control at both medium-voltage (MV) and low-voltage (LV) levels.
   Results demonstrated that there was a communication system between all
   generators protective systems, a selective protective system, a tracking
   of perturbations system to isolate failure defects, and a phase control
   system between the generators and the network. Also synchronizing
   voltage regulation is crucial for guaranteeing the quality of the power
   supply.
   Currently, recent and modern technologies allow different services to
   share a single communications infrastructure while guaranteeing the
   required levels of security, reliability, and efficiency. This paper
   aims to provide a Smart City (SC) project, implemented in the city of
   Malaga, Spain, where the integration of the applications of Smart Grid
   (SG) and the Use Cases (UCs) for the different functionalities of SG has
   been developed. The SC architecture proposed envisions a hierarchical,
   distributed, and autonomous structure to address the challenge of smart
   distribution grids.
   As a result of this project, new levels of standardization of languages
   and protocols and new interconnection functions will be required. These
   functions will allow smart devices to recognize each other so that they
   can reconnect in case of failure regardless of the state of the network
   topology.
   In conclusion, renewable energy sources (RES) can be optimally
   integrated into the distribution grid. Generation can approach
   consumption through the installation of photovoltaic (PV) panels and
   mini-wind generators, with the reuse of electrical infrastructure. (C)

Abstract = {{What research supports the view that compact, walkable, diverse (CWD)
   neighborhoods are beneficial for urban residents? To make this
   assessment, we searched the literature to try to understand the current
   status of evidence regarding claims about the CWD neighborhood. We find
   that research linking CWD neighborhoods to effects on residents
   coalesces around three main topics: social relations, health, and
   safety. We conclude that on the basis of the literature reviewed, most
   of the intended benefits of the CWD neighborhood have been researched
   and found to have significant, positive effects for urban dwellers.
   While physical factors are but one element affecting behavior and
   outcomes, and the issues of self-selection and causality remain,
   overall, key dimensions of the CWD neighborhood have been found to
   positively affect social interaction, health, and safety.}},

   The dimensions of the model are not restricted, but a typical case would
   comprise an hour-by-hour simulation over a whole year with a spatial
   resolution from a few hundred meters up to several kilometers, depending
   on the area to be covered. These kinds of load profiles are useful when
   analyzing, e.g., smart grids, demand side management, and renewable
   energy in the urban context. The model was applied to two cities,
   Helsinki with detailed input data available, and Shanghai with access to
   rough data only. In both cases, the generated load patterns appeared

   Member states turn their knowledge bases into urban growth more
   efficiently than those in the EU-15, especially owing to the weak
   initial level of synthetic knowledge creation and transfer. We also
   demonstrate that economic growth in 2004-2009 was mainly attributed to
   economic convergence and internal knowledge transfer with sales effects.

Abstract = {{Decline, measured in population growth rates, population levels, housing
   stock and economic activity, and associated increases in vacant land in
   urban areas, is a reality for cities and regions within the United
   States. However, planners increasingly see `decline' as a development
   state to anticipate and a development strategy to consider. For example,
   a place may lose population while continuing to provide a high quality
   of life and social value. Vacant land is central to planning issues
   related to decline: some currently-occupied housing may likely become
   abandoned and demolished, yielding vacant lots, while some currently
   vacant lots may be inputs to alternative uses such as recreational
   space, urban farming or commercial uses. In this paper, we develop
   decision models that enable planners to generate a range of
   neighborhood-level development strategies that jointly optimize multiple
   objectives related to residential satisfaction, scale economies in
   development and equity. We apply these models to a case study of a small
   city. Model solutions may help planners understand how alternative model
   formulations are associated with spatial variation in active versus
   passive land uses, values of important output measures such as
   residential satisfaction, and the special role that vacant land plays in
   regional development policies that can be classified as smart growth or
   smart decline. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Internationally, rainwater tank systems have experienced a renaissance
   in urban areas in recent times as they are perceived to be a low cost
   source substitution option for many end uses or micro-components (e.g.
   toilet, clothes washer, irrigation, etc.) of water demand. While there
   are many studies that have been conducted investigating rainwater tank
   performance, none have explored their water-energy nexus at a
   micro-component level. Through a high resolution (i.e. 5 s, 0.014
   L/pulse, 1 W/pulse) smart metering study, this research was able to
   reveal the energy intensity of three rainwater tank end uses in 19
   residential homes located in Gold Coast City, Queensland, Australia.
   Half flush toilet cistern events were found to have the highest
   variability of energy intensity values between homes (1.05-3.32 Wh/L)
   and also the highest energy intensity at 1.88 Wh/L. Full flush toilet
   events had a tighter range (1.02-2.30 Wh/L) and slightly lower energy
   intensity than half flush events at 1.61 Wh/L. Clothes washer energy
   intensity values were quite variable (0.90-2.73 Wh/L) but on average
   were lower than toilet flushing at 1.28 Wh/L. Lastly, irrigation events
   had the tightest range (0.83-1.66 Wh/L) and lowest average energy
   intensity of 1.12 Wh/L. The study has significant implications for
   building code specifications for internally plumbed rain tanks systems,
   particularly fit-for-purpose pump selection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Over the past two decades, a growing international trend has been the
   implementation of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) as a cost-effective way to
   enhance urban public transport (UPT) service quality and progress
   towards sustainable urban transport. To date, in excess of 40 cities
   worldwide operate BRT within their UPT networks. Despite the
   international prominence of BRT systems, there has been limited in-depth
   investigation of their spatial-temporal dynamics. Drawing on a case
   study BRT system, Brisbane, Australia, we apply a
   geo-visualisation-based method to a large smart card database to examine
   spatial-temporal dynamics. The conditional flow-maps (or flow-comaps)
   are created to visually compare the spatial trajectories of BRT trips
   and other bus-based trips and their variation by calendar events (i.e.,
   a workday, a weekend, a school holiday and a public holiday). The
   results highlight (1) marked differences between BRT-based trips to
   those bus trips undertaken on the broader UPT network; (2) spatial
   heterogeneity in BRT trips; and (3) the potential of drawing on `big
   data' to support evidence-based BRT planning. These findings render
   important implications with the capacity to inform future BRT strategy
   as it relates to service management and infrastructure expansion. (C)

Abstract = {{Urban development is a complex spatio-temporal process that involves
   both horizontal and vertical growth. Despite growing recognition of the
   significance of horizontal development, models of urban vertical growth
   remain limited. This study aims to develop a GIS-based cellular automata
   model for exploring the vertical complexities of urban growth. Taking
   into account a series of variables, including accessibility, population
   density and building density and height, an ``IF-THEN{''} rule base is
   designed and employed to simulate different height states of building
   growth. The model is validated through application to a case study of
   Guangzhou city for the period of 2001-2010. The results of the proposed
   model are compared with Guangzhou Urban Planning Bureau reference data
   for newly authorized construction buildings and then tested using an
   error matrix for 2001-2005 (overall accuracy 81.2\% and Kappa
   coefficient 74.2\%) and a fractal dimension for 2006-2010. Several
   conclusions are made based on the fractal analysis: (1) low-rise
   buildings tend to ``spread outward,{''} while high-rise buildings
   exhibit a trend of ``compact development{''}; (2) a ``hot zone{''} of
   vertical growth in Guangzhou demonstrates that the city is now
   undergoing a ``phase transition{''} from a mono-center to a bi-center;
   and (3) low-, moderate-, and high-state buildings are being co-developed
   and are thus beginning to constitute an important feature of the urban
   and smart growth landscape. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research suggests that the local stock of human capital creates
   positive externalities within local labor markets and plays an important
   role in regional economic development. However, there is still
   considerable uncertainty over what types of human capital are most
   important. Both national and local policymakers in the U.S. have called
   for efforts to increase the stock of college graduates in science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, but data
   availability has thus far prevented researchers from directly connecting
   STEM education to human capital externalities. This paper uses the
   2009-2011 American Community Survey to examine the external effects of
   college graduates in STEM and non-STEM fields on the wages of other
   workers in the same metropolitan area. I find that both types of college
   graduates create positive wage externalities, but STEM graduates create
   much larger externalities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Ridership and effectiveness of bikesharing: The effects of urban
   features and system characteristics on daily use and turnover rate of
   public bikes in China}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORT POLICY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{As a pinnacle of green transportation with transit attributes,
   bikesharing has become particularly popular since the mid-2000s. Two
   crucial questions for the success of bikesharing adoption are how many
   riders can bikesharing attract, and what influences its effectiveness.
   To shed light on answers to these questions, this paper models the
   impacts of urban features and system characteristics on bikesharing
   daily use and turnover rate, using data constructed on 69 bikesharing
   systems in China. Prior to modeling, we provide an overview of
   bikesharing adoption in China, describing why they have been adopted,
   how they have matured, and how they have expanded. Results from data
   regression and comparison indicate that bikesharing ridership and
   turnover rate tend to increase with urban population, government
   expenditure, the number of bikesharing members and docking stations,
   whilst the number of public bikes shows significant but adverse signs in
   impacting bikesharing ridership and turnover rate. Data comparison shows
   that, to pursue an ideal bikesharing turnover rate in most Chinese
   cities, the bike-member (supply-demand) ratio should be better
   controlled within 0.2. Moreover, this study suggests that personal
   credit cards (allowing bikesharing members to pay ``personal credit{''}
   rather than money if they do not return public bikes within the free use
   hours) and universal cards (integrating bikesharing systems into other
   urban transit systems through the use of a rechargeable smart card that
   can cover a range of payments and trips) can significantly raise
   bikesharing daily use and turnover rate. We recommend that bikesharing
   operators and transit agencies take the supply-demand thresholds and the
   adoption of personal credit cards and universal cards into consideration
   in the future bikesharing operation and development policy. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This study proposes a coordinated online in-vehicle routing mechanism
   for smart vehicles with real-time information exchange and portable
   computation capabilities. The proposed coordinated routing mechanism
   incorporates a discrete choice model to account for drivers' behavior,
   and is implemented by a simultaneously-updating distributed algorithm.
   This study shows the existence of an equilibrium coordinated routing
   decision for the mixed-strategy routing game and the convergence of the
   distributed algorithm to the equilibrium routing decision, assuming
   individual smart vehicles are selfish players seeking to minimize their
   own travel time. Numerical experiments conducted based on Sioux Falls
   city network indicate that the proposed distributed algorithm converges
   quickly under different smart vehicle penetrations, thus it possesses a
   great potential for online applications. Moreover, the proposed
   coordinated routing mechanism outperforms traditional independent
   selfish-routing mechanism; it reduces travel time for both overall
   system and individual vehicles, which represents the core idea of
   Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The soda-technical approach to innovation is used to show that the
   future of urban mobility will depend on the competition between
   coalitions of innovative actors who support alternative transport
   systems. A new graphical tool the socio-technical map is introduced in
   order to represent the positioning of supporting coalitions with
   reference to three variables: business models, propulsion technologies
   and power. Three transition pathways to 2030 may emerge from the current
   situation of urban mobility: 1) `AUTO-city', i.e. the reconfiguration of
   the `individual car' dominant system through the stable integration of
   producers of batteries; 2) `ECO-city', i.e. the further empowering and
   diffusion of local coalitions which already integrate all non-car modes
   of transport; 3) `ELECTRI-city', i.e. a new `electricity vehicles +
   smart grids' system established by a coalition led by electric
   operators. Because of the cumulative processes between the
   transformation of supporting coalition and their access to higher level
   of competence and power, both technologies and policies can be
   considered as endogenous variables to transition pathways. The resulting
   policy prescriptions are dear-cut: if not destabilized by policy
   pressure, the `AUTO-city' will prevail; to support the `ECO-city' and
   the `ELECTRI-city', a multilevel policy for urban and transport planning
   and a national innovation and industrial policy are needed,

Abstract = {{A cost-effective and robust waste treatment and recycling system is a
   requisite of a sustainable society. In our previous study, we proposed a
   ``smart recycling system{''} that utilizes existing industrial
   facilities with higher energy efficiency so that a cost-effective and
   robust recycling system for treating municipal wastes can be
   established. In this study, we further develop the concept of smart
   recycling and propose a framework for facilitating the implementation of
   such a system. By making use of existing facilities and adopting both
   closed-loop and semi-closed-loop recycling processes, this system allows
   flexible adaptations on the changes of external factors. A spatially
   optimal scale is necessary to meet the requirements for such a smart
   recycling system. Thus, we develop an integrated model that combines
   both geographical information system based collection model and a
   process model for a smart recycling center. In order to test its
   applicability, we employ a case study approach to simulate the
   implementation of smart recycling in the three satellite cities of Tokyo
   Metropolitan Area and evaluate its effects under three different
   scenarios. Our simulation results show that smart recycling cannot only
   reduce carbon dioxide emission but also lower the overall costs. Also,
   by comparing with conventional waste incineration, we find that the unit
   cost of smart recycling is relatively stable to changes of the waste
   amounts due to its lower fixed costs for facilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Water utilities worldwide face increasing challenges to preserve the
   hydraulic and water quality integrity of their water distribution
   networks. These challenges stem from burgeoning populations and
   migration to urban cities that continue to increase the load on aging,

   pressing need for integrating supervisory control and data acquisition
   (SCADA) systems with network simulation models for proactive management
   of these networks. Such an integrated platform is the basis for the
   real-time smart water network decision support system (SWNDSS) described
   here. The proposed system has the power to transform a water utility's
   routine network modeling functions from planning and design to
   full-spectrum engagement that drives more efficient operations including
   managing water quality and energy, developing daily operating plans,
   addressing planned and emergency outages, and diagnosing and resolving
   field issues. Aspects of the system are presented in a case study from

Abstract = {{The assessment of the potential impact of climate change on transport is
   an area of research very much in its infancy, and one that requires
   input from a multitude of disciplines including geography, engineering
   and technology, meteorology, climatology and futures studies. This paper
   investigates the current state of the art for assessments on urban
   surface transport, where rising populations and increasing dependence on
   efficient and reliable mobility have increased the importance placed on
   resilience to weather. The standard structure of climate change impact
   assessment (CIA) requires understanding in three important areas: how
   weather currently affects infrastructure and operations; how climate
   change may alter the frequency and magnitude of these impacts; and how
   concurrent technological and socio-economic development may shape the
   transport network of the future, either ameliorating or exacerbating the
   effects of climate change. The extent to which the requisite knowledge
   exists for a successful CIA is observed to decrease from the former to
   the latter. This paper traces a number of developments in the
   extrapolation of physical and behavioural relationships on to future
   climates, including a broad move away from previous deterministic
   methods and towards probabilistic projections which make use of a much
   broader range of climate change model output, giving a better
   representation of the uncertainty involved. Studies increasingly demand
   spatially and temporally downscaled climate projections that can
   represent realistic sub-daily fluctuations in weather that transport
   systems are sensitive to. It is recommended that future climate change
   impact assessments should focus on several key areas, including better
   representation of sub-daily extremes in climate tools, and recreation of
   realistic spatially coherent weather. Greater use of the increasing
   amounts of data created and captured by intelligent infrastructure' and
   smart cities' is also needed to develop behavioural and physical models
   of the response of transport to weather and to develop a better
   understanding of how stakeholders respond to probabilistic climate
   change impact projections.}},

Abstract = {{The expansion of globalising cities into global city-regions poses
   fundamental questions about how best to govern the new metropolis.
   Partly because of the relentless pace of change, these newly emerging
   metropolitan spaces are often reliant on inadequate urban-economic
   infrastructure and fragmented urban-regional planning and governance
   arrangements. Moreover, as the demand for more `appropriate', widely
   understood to mean more flexible, networked and smart, forms of planning
   and governance increases, new expressions of territorial cooperation and
   conflict are emerging around issues of increased competitiveness,
   infrastructure development, the collective provision of services, and
   further governmentalised remapping(s) of state space. We identify four
   central tenets of the metropolitan region/governance debate and discuss
   their relevance for future research on city-regions: (1) periodisation
   and trajectories, (2) democracy and accountability, (3) form and
   function, and (4) fragility and mobilisation. These, we argue, pose key
   challenges for rethinking city-region governance within the emerging new
   metropolitan paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a transportation network based on a
   supercapacitor-powered electric city bus (Capabus) has been shown to
   work in harmony with the electric grid. The load profile of the
   transportation network and the grid are interfaced using a battery-based
   energy storage system (ESS), which is used at each bus stop to
   continuously charge the supercapacitors for bus operation and provide
   grid support. The power flow from the ESS to the grid and vice versa is
   regulated using a fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The FLC takes as input
   the energy of ESS, node voltage {[}in per unit (p.u.)], and the
   frequency of the buses plying on a practical ring-road circuit of a
   typical city. The ESSs stabilize the grid at the corresponding node
   through peak shaving and valley filling during peak and off-peak hours,
   respectively. The objective of this paper is to achieve the required
   frequency of buses and maintain the grid voltage close to 1 p.u.
   Increasing penetration of the electric-bus-based transit system will
   substantially improve grid operation efficiency and reduce oil
   consumption by the transport sector.}},

Abstract = {{Parking is becoming an expensive resource in almost any major city in
   the world, and its limited availability is a concurrent cause of urban
   traffic congestion, and air pollution. In old cities, the structure of
   the public parking space is rigidly organised and often in the form of
   on-street public parking spots. Unfortunately, these public parking
   spots cannot be reserved beforehand during the pre-trip phase, and that
   often lead to a detriment of the quality of urban mobility. Addressing
   the problem of managing public parking spots is therefore vital to
   obtain environmentally friendlier and healthier cities. Recent
   technological progresses in industrial automation, wireless network,
   sensor communication along with the widespread of high-range smart
   devices and new rules concerning financial transactions in mobile
   payment allow the definition of new intelligent frameworks that enable a
   convenient management of public parking in urban area, which could
   improve sustainable urban mobility. In such a scenario, the proposed
   intelligent parking assistant (IPA) architecture aims at overcoming
   current public parking management solutions. This study discusses the
   conceptual architecture of IPA and the first prototype-scale simulations
   of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the world's population lives in urban areas and in inefficient
   buildings under the energy point of view. Starting from these
   assumptions, there is the need to identify methodologies and innovations
   able to improve social development and the quality of life of people
   living in cities. Smart cities can be a viable solution. The methodology
   traditionally adopted to evaluate building energy efficiency starts from
   the structure's energy demands analysis and the demands reduction
   evaluation. Consequently, the energy savings is assessed through a
   cascade of interventions. Regarding the building envelope, the first
   intervention is usually related to the reduction of the thermal
   transmittance value, but there is also the need to emphasize the
   building energy savings through other parameters, such as the solar gain
   factor and dye solar absorbance coefficients. In this contribution, a
   standard building has been modeled by means of the well-known dynamic
   software, TRNSYS. This study shows a parametrical analysis through which
   it is possible to evaluate the effect of each single intervention and,
   consequently, its influence on the building energy demand. Through this
   analysis, an intervention chart has been carried out, aiming to assess
   the intervention efficiency starting from the percentage variation of
   energy demands.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, automated fare collection (AFC) systems using smart card
   technology have become the main method for collecting urban rail transit
   (URT) fares in many cities around the world. Transaction data obtained
   through these AFC systems contain a large amount of archived information

   calibrating assignment models for precise passenger flow calculation. We
   present a methodology for calibrating URT assignment models using AFC
   data. The calibration approach uses a genetic algorithm-based framework
   with nonparametric statistical techniques. Three initial numerical tests
   show that the proposed approach finds more reasonable solutions than
   traditional approaches for the calibrated parameters. Furthermore, after
   calibration by the proposed approach, the existing assignment model
   delivers more accurate calculations of passenger flows in the network.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decade, global interest according to energy efficiency
   and climate change has dramatically increased. In particular, the
   building sector plays an important role, as it accounts for significant
   percentages of total energy consumption. So numerous high energy
   efficiency devices have been developed and applied to building. But it
   is also important that such high energy efficiency equipment is operated
   through efficient management. In this paper through establishing a
   Building Energy Management System (BEMS) in the test-beds, the energy
   consumption and environmental data are measured and gathered at a total
   operation center The proposed energy saving technologies would integrate
   real-time energy consumption monitoring with Building Energy Information
   Modeling (BEIM). To find an optimal energy-saving method, a building
   energy simulation was used with Genetic Algorithms. The Heating
   Ventilating and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) control schedules were sought.
   The energy-saving effect of this method is about 9.44\%. HVAC control
   schedules can be applied to building, using a function to control
   facilities in buildings. This energy-saving effect will be added to the
   general saving effects for BEMS. It is expected that the proposed energy
   optimization tool using BEIM will be applied to the micro-energy grid
   system for smart city in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Central to the Smart Growth movement is that compact development reduces
   vehicle miles traveled, carbon emissions, and water use. Empirical
   efforts to evaluate compact development have examined residential
   densities but have not distinguished decreasing lot sizes from
   multifamily apartments as mechanisms for compact development. Efforts to
   link design features to water use have emphasized single-family at the
   expense of multifamily housing. This study isolates the determinants of
   water use in large (more than fifty units) apartment complexes in the
   city of Tempe, Arizona. In July 2007, per bedroom water use increased
   with pool area, dishwashers, and in-unit laundry facilities. We are able
   to explain nearly 50 percent of the variation in water demand with these
   variables. These results inform public policy for reducing water use in
   multifamily housing structures, suggesting strategies to construct and
   market green apartment units.}},

Abstract = {{Background The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends
   program monitors the activity of antibiotics against aerobic and
   facultative Gram-negative bacilli (GNBs) from intra-abdominal infections
   (IAIs) in patients worldwide.
   Methods In 2011, 1 929 aerobic and facultative GNBs from 21 hospitals in
   16 cities in China were collected. All isolates were tested using a
   panel of 12 antimicrobial agents, and susceptibility was determined
   following the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.
   Results Among the Gram-negative pathogens causing IAIs, Escherichia coli
   (47.3\%) was the most commonly isolated, followed by Klebsiella
   pneumoniae (17.2\%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1\%), and Acinetobacter
   baumannii (8.3\%). Enterobacteriaceae comprised 78.8\% (1521/1929) of
   the total isolates. Among the antimicrobial agents tested, ertapenem and
   imipenem were the most active agents against Enterobacteriaceae, with
   susceptibility rates of 95.1\% and 94.4\%, followed by amikacin (93.9\%)
   and piperacillin/tazobactam (87.7\%). Susceptibility rates of
   ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime against
   Enterobacteriaceae were 38.3\%, 38.3\%, 61.1\%, and 50.8\%,
   respectively. The least-active agent against Enterobacteriaceae was
   ampicillin/sulbactam (25.9\%). The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
   (ESBL) rates among E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and
   Proteus mirabilis were 68.8\%, 38.1\%, 41.2\%, and 57.7\%, respectively.
   Conclusions Enterobacteriaceae were the major pathogens causing IAIs,
   and the most active agents against the study isolates (including those
   producing ESBLs) were ertapenem, imipenem, and amikacin. Including the
   carbapenems, most agents exhibited reduced susceptibility against
   ESBL-positive and multidrug-resistant isolates.}},

Abstract = {{Problem, research strategy, and findings: To understand how communities
   use zoning ordinances to achieve sustainability goals, we identify nine
   sustainability principles and 53 associated regulatory items that might
   be included in a zoning ordinance to achieve sustainable development and
   then examine the zoning ordinances of 32 randomly selected communities
   to determine if they included these principles and their associated
   items. We find both wide variation and some consistency in how zoning
   ordinances address sustainability goals, independent of city size or
   location in the country. Some of the identified principles and
   regulatory items are found in many ordinances; others appear in only a
   few. However, there is an inverse relationship between the age of the
   ordinance and the extent to which it includes sustainability principles.
   As ordinances are updated, it is likely that they will address more
   topical sustainability concerns. We study only ordinance content, not
   implementation; moreover, sustainability can be achieved in ways other
   than zoning. However, zoning ordinances that directly address
   sustainability in many dimensions are more likely to achieve these
   goals. We conclude that planners can more effectively use zoning
   ordinances to achieve sustainable development.Takeaway for practice:
   This review of zoning ordinances can alert local planners to the many
   ways in which zoning ordinances could be used to achieve sustainability
   goals and suggest how planners can assess the contribution of their
   zoning ordinance to the sustainable development of their communities.}},

Abstract = {{Smart city services are implemented using various data collected from
   houses and infrastructure within a city. As the volume and variety of
   the smart city data becomes huge, individual services have suffered from
   expensive computation effort and large processing time. In order to
   reduce the effort and time, this paper proposes a concept of
   Materialized View as a Service (MVaaS). Using the MVaaS, every
   application can easily and dynamically construct its own materialized
   view, in which the raw data is converted and stored in a convenient
   format with appropriate granularity. Thus, once the view is constructed,
   the application can quickly access necessary data. In this paper, we
   design a framework of MVaaS specifically for large-scale house log,
   managed in a smart-city data platform. In the framework, each
   application first specifies how the raw data should be filtered, grouped
   and aggregated. For a given data specification, MVaaS dynamically
   constructs a MapReduce batch program that converts the raw data into a
   desired view. The batch is then executed on Hadoop, and the resultant
   view is stored in HBase. We present case studies using house log in a
   real home network system. We also conduct an experimental evaluation to
   compare the response time between cases with and without MVaaS.}},

Title = {{Approximate Semantic Matching of Events for the Internet of Things}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Event processing follows a decoupled model of interaction in space,
   time, and synchronization. However, another dimension of semantic
   coupling also exists and poses a challenge to the scalability of event
   processing systems in highly semantically heterogeneous and dynamic
   environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Current
   state-of-the-art approaches of content-based and concept-based event
   systems require a significant agreement between event producers and
   consumers on event schema or an external conceptual model of event
   semantics. Thus, they do not address the semantic coupling issue. This
   article proposes an approach where participants only agree on a
   distributional statistical model of semantics represented in a corpus of
   text to derive semantic similarity and relatedness. It also proposes an
   approximate model for relaxing the semantic coupling dimension via an
   approximation-enabled rule language and an approximate event matcher.
   The model is formalized as an ensemble of semantic and top-k matchers
   along with a probability model for uncertainty management. The model has
   been empirically validated on large sets of events and subscriptions
   synthesized from real-world smart city and energy management systems.
   Experiments show that the proposed model achieves more than 95\%
   F(1)Score of effectiveness and thousands of events/sec of throughput for
   medium degrees of approximation while not requiring users to have
   complete prior knowledge of event semantics. In semantically
   loosely-coupled environments, one approximate subscription can
   compensate for hundreds of exact subscriptions to cover all
   possibilities in environments which require complete prior knowledge of
   event semantics. Results indicate that approximate semantic event
   processing could play a promising role in the IoT middleware layer.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid uptake of residential photovoltaic (PV) systems is causing
   serious power quality issues such as significant voltage fluctuation and
   unbalance that are restricting the ability of networks to accommodate
   further connections. Based on the latent reactive power capability and
   real power curtailment of single-phase inverters, this paper proposes a
   new comprehensive PV operational optimization strategy to improve the
   performance of significantly unbalanced three-phase four-wire low
   voltage (LV) distribution networks with high residential PV
   penetrations. A multiobjective optimal power flow (OPF) problem that can
   simultaneously improve voltage magnitude and balance profiles, while
   minimizing network losses and generation costs, is defined and then
   converted into an aggregated single-objective OPF problem using the
   weighted-sum method, which can be effectively solved by the global
   Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) approach with multiple starting
   points in MATLAB. Detailed simulations are performed and analyzed for
   various operating scenarios over 24 h on a real unbalanced four-wire LV
   distribution network in Perth Solar City trial, Australia. Finally,
   smart meter readings are used to justify the validity and accuracy of
   the proposed optimization model and considerations on the application of
   the proposed PV control strategy are also presented.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{There are a number of instanceswhen consumers have imperfect information
   regarding the quantity they consume. This paper has two objectives: (1)
   to formally describe how quantity uncertainty is likely to affect
   consumer behavior and (2) to describe how these changes in behavior are
   likely to differ depending on how the quantity uncertain good is priced.
   We develop a theoretical model of consumer behavior under quantity
   uncertainty which we use to illustrate how different price structures
   and different locations within price structures matter for how
   information impacts behavior. We test these hypotheses using a unique
   panel data set containing information on water consumption habits of
   more than 88,000 households in the City of Aurora, Colorado. In 2005,
   Aurora subsidized the purchase of electronic devices for households to
   monitor water use. These devices provide households with real-time
   information on their water use. We find that, consistent with the aims
   of the program, households with the device decreased their water use
   during periods when they faced a constantmarginal price; however,
   contrary to the aims of the program, their consumption increased during
   periods when they faced an increasing block rate pricing structure.
   These results are consistent with the predictions of the theoretical
   model developed herein.}},

Title = {{A study on smart parking guidance algorithm}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{299-317}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Parking problem becomes one of major issues in the city transportation
   management since the spatial resource of a city is limited and the
   parking cost is expensive. Lots of cars on the road should spend
   unnecessary time and consume energy during searching for parking due to
   limited parking space. To cope with these limitations and give more
   intelligent solutions to drivers in the selection of parking facility,
   this study proposes a smart parking guidance algorithm. The proposed
   algorithm supports drivers to find the most appropriate parking facility
   considering real-time status of parking facilities in a city. To suggest
   the most suitable parking facility, several factors such as driving
   distance to the guided parking facility, walking distance from the
   guided parking facility to destination, expected parking cost, and
   traffic congestion due to parking guidance, are considered in the
   proposed algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithm, simulation tests have been carried out. The proposed
   algorithm helps to maximize the utilization of space resources of a
   city, and reduce unnecessary energy consumption and CO2 emission of
   wandering cars since it is designed to control the utilization of
   parking facility efficiently and reduce traffic congestion due to
   parking space search. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cities are areas where Big Data is having a real impact. Town planners
   and administration bodies just need the right tools at their fingertips
   to consume all the data points that a town or city generates and then be
   able to turn that into actions that improve peoples' lives. In this
   case, Big Data is definitely a phenomenon that has a direct impact on
   the quality of life for those of us that choose to live in a town or
   city. Smart Cities of tomorrow will rely not only on sensors within the
   city infrastructure, but also on a large number of devices that will
   willingly sense and integrate their data into technological platforms
   used for introspection into the habits and situations of individuals and
   city-large communities. Predictions say that cities will generate over
   4.1 terabytes per day per square kilometer of urbanized land area by
   2016. Handling efficiently such amounts of data is already a challenge.
   In this paper we present our solutions designed to support
   next-generation Big Data applications. We first present CAPIM, a
   platform designed to automate the process of collecting and aggregating
   context information on a large scale. It integrates services designed to
   collect context data (location, user's profile and characteristics, as
   well as the environment). Later on, we present a concrete implementation
   of an Intelligent Transportation System designed on top of CAPIM. The
   application is designed to assist users and city officials better
   understand traffic problems in large cities. Finally, we present a
   solution to handle efficient storage of context data on a large scale.
   The combination of these services provides support for intelligent Smart
   City applications, for actively and autonomously adaptation and smart
   provision of services and content, using the advantages of contextual
   information. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Looking at the South Korean case of New Songdo City and comparing it
   with two Chinese cities, the Yujiapu Financial District and Lingang New
   City, this study examines practices of city building in Northeast Asia
   not simply from an ambitious urban design aspect, but more critically
   from the planning patterns and emphatic discourses employed in these
   developments. Designed by top-down decisions to reach the ocean coast
   from the centres of the metropolitan region, New Songdo City drew upon
   the Global City paradigm that employs comprehensive modernist urban
   plans, while city developers aspired it to be a strategically
   positioned, new urban gate to its metropolitan region. Similar ambitions
   feed the creation of Yujiapu and Lingang and are coloured by a
   competitive developmental agenda of catching up the West on the one hand
   and surpassing regional rival cities on the other hand. These South
   Korean and Chinese examples stand as emblematic instances of how the
   currency of global city development is now articulated through popular
   planning discourses like ecologically conscious and technologically
   advanced urbanism. Framed as Green City Development, the three new
   cities reveal narrowly tailored global themes of sustainability and
   intelligence that address the current modes of imagining urban space in
   Northeast Asia.}},

Abstract = {{A fuzzy neural network (FNN) calculates the traffic-light system and
   extends or terminates the green signal according to the traffic
   situation at the given junction while also computing from adjacent
   intersections. In the presence of public transports, the system decides
   which signal(s) should be red and how much of an extension should be
   given to green signals for the priority-based vehicle. Using fuzzy
   logic, we propose a model with a neural network for public transport,
   normal cars, and motorcycles. The model controls traffic-light systems
   to reduce traffic congestion and help vehicles with high priority pass
   through. The system also monitors the density of car flows and makes
   real-time decisions accordingly. In order to verify the proposed design
   algorithm, we adapted the simulations of Simulation of Urban MObility,
   ns2, and green light district simulation method to our model, and
   further results depict the performance of the proposed FNN in handling
   traffic congestion and priority-based traffic. The promising results
   present the efficiency and the scope of the proposed multi-module

Title = {{Forecasting energy consumption of multi-family residential buildings
   using support vector regression: Investigating the impact of temporal
   and spatial monitoring granularity on performance accuracy}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Buildings are the dominant source of energy consumption and
   environmental emissions in urban areas. Therefore, the ability to
   forecast and characterize building energy consumption is vital to
   implementing urban energy management and efficiency initiatives required
   to curb emissions. Advances in smart metering technology have enabled
   researchers to develop `'sensor based'' approaches to forecast building
   energy consumption that necessitate less input data than traditional
   methods. Sensor-based forecasting utilizes machine learning techniques
   to infer the complex relationships between consumption and influencing
   variables (e.g., weather, time of day, previous consumption). While
   sensor-based forecasting has been studied extensively for commercial
   buildings, there is a paucity of research applying this data-driven
   approach to the multi-family residential sector. In this paper, we build
   a sensor-based forecasting model using Support Vector Regression (SVR),
   a commonly used machine learning technique, and apply it to an empirical
   data-set from a multi-family residential building in New York City. We
   expand our study to examine the impact of temporal (i.e., daily, hourly,
   10 min intervals) and spatial (i.e., whole building, by floor, by unit)
   granularity have on the predictive power of our single-step model.
   Results indicate that sensor based forecasting models can be extended to
   multi-family residential buildings and that the optimal monitoring
   granularity occurs at the by floor level in hourly intervals. In
   addition to implications for the development of residential energy
   forecasting models, our results have practical significance for the
   deployment and installation of advanced smart metering devices.
   Ultimately, accurate and cost effective wide-scale energy prediction is
   a vital step towards next-generation energy efficiency initiatives,
   which will require not only consideration of the methods, but the scales
   for which data can be distilled into meaningful information. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This study proposes a new typological framework for classifying smart
   city services. Intentionally focused on citizen-centricity, away from
   bureaucratic perspectives that most typologies have taken, this typology
   is derived from marketing and service science literature. The proposed
   typology consists of four dimensions: mode of technology
   (automate-informative-transformative), purpose of service
   (hedonic-utilitarian), service authority (voluntary-mandatory), and
   delivery mode (passive-interactive). This typological framework is
   validated with a qualitative exercise of classifying inventories of
   actual smart city services in practice into the framework Exercise
   results revealed that the categories provided are mutually exclusive and
   comprehensively exhaustive in general, and useful in further
   conceptualization of new services by identifying gaps in reality. In
   practice, this typology would be useful in positioning specific smart
   city service under development in terms of citizen-centricity. Urban
   planners and administrators may use this framework in understanding the
   pattern of their service development. Also, this framework may provide a
   useful guideline for service designer pinpointing the design

Abstract = {{Nowadays there are many intelligent electronic devices in the everyday

   providers in the cities, etc. These electronic devices usually
   communicate with other devices and people in order to perform tasks or

   devices is using the device interfaces (buttons, touch screens, etc.).
   However, there are other ways of interacting such as Smartphone's, which
   are used to communicate users with electronic devices. Normally, the
   user selects the commands or actions from an application installed on
   the Smartphone. This application uses the Smartphone communication
   hardware elements (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) to send the selected commands
   to the electronic device. Native mobile applications are
   platform-dependent (Android, Symbian, etc.) and are developed for

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{63-73}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In a world where resources are scarce and urban areas consume the vast
   majority of these resources, it is vital to make cities greener and more
   sustainable. A smart city is a city in which information and
   communications technology are merged with traditional infrastructures,
   coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies. The
   increasing amount of waste generated, and the collection and treatment
   of waste poses a major challenge to modern urban planning in general,
   and to smart cities in particular. To cope with this problem, automated
   vacuum waste collection (AVWC) uses air suction on a closed network of
   underground pipes to transport waste from the drop off points scattered
   throughout the city to a central collection point, reducing greenhouse
   gas emissions and the inconveniences of conventional methods (odours,
   noise, etc.). Since a significant part of the cost of operating AVWC
   systems is energy consumption, we have developed a model with the aim of
   applying constraint programming technology to schedule the daily
   emptying sequences of the drop off points in such a way that energy
   consumption is minimized. In this paper we describe how the problem of
   deciding the drop off points that should be emptied at a given time can
   be modeled as a constraint integer programming (CIP) problem. Moreover,
   we report on experiments using real data from AVWC systems installed in
   different cities that provide empirical evidence that CIP offers a
   suitable technology for reducing energy consumption in AVWC. (c) 2013

Title = {{Towards Uniform Accelerometry Analysis: A Standardization Methodology to
   Minimize Measurement Bias Due to Systematic Accelerometer Wear-Time
   Variation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCE AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{379-386}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Accelerometers are predominantly used to objectively measure the entire
   range of activity intensities -sedentary behaviour (SED), light physical
   activity (LPA) and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA).
   However, studies consistently report results without accounting for
   systematic accelerometer weartime variation (within and between
   participants), jeopardizing the validity of these results. This study
   describes the development of a standardization methodology to understand
   and minimize measurement bias due to wear-time variation. Accelerometry
   is generally conducted over seven consecutive days, with participants'
   data being commonly considered `valid' only if wear-time is at least 10
   hours/day. However, even within `valid' data, there could be systematic
   wear-time variation. To explore this variation, accelerometer data of
   Smart Cities, Healthy Kids study (www.smartcitieshealthykids.com) were
   analyzed descriptively and with repeated measures multivariate analysis
   of variance (MANOVA). Subsequently, a standardization method was
   developed, where case-specific observed wear-time is controlled to an
   analyst specified time period. Next, case-specific accelerometer data
   are interpolated to this controlled wear-time to produce standardized
   variables. To understand discrepancies owing to wear-time variation, all
   analyses were conducted pre-and post-standardization. Descriptive
   analyses revealed systematic wear-time variation, both between and
   within participants. Pre-and post-standardized descriptive analyses of
   SED, LPA and MVPA revealed a persistent and often significant trend of
   wear-time's influence on activity. SED was consistently higher on
   weekdays before standardization; however, this trend was reversed
   post-standardization. Even though MVPA was significantly higher on
   weekdays both pre-and post-standardization, the magnitude of this
   difference decreased post-standardization. Multivariable analyses with
   standardized SED, LPA and MVPA as outcome variables yielded more stable
   results with narrower confidence intervals and smaller standard errors.
   Standardization of accelerometer data is effective in not only
   minimizing measurement bias due to systematic wear-time variation, but
   also to provide a uniform platform to compare results within and between
   populations and studies.}},

Title = {{Putting domestic gardens on the agenda using empirical spatial data: The
   case of Flanders}},
Journal = {{APPLIED GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{132-143}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Spatial data are considered to be an essential entry point to get
   domestic gardens on the agendas of land use monitoring, spatial planning
   and environmental policies. As a green facet of urbanization, gardens
   cover a substantial part of land all over the world. Moreover, domestic
   gardens deliver several ecosystem services. The sustainability turn in
   planning however focuses on densification. In densification scenarios,
   planners could consider domestic garden area as a land reserve. Yet, due
   to a lack of data they would be ill-informed on the domestic garden
   services and potentials and not be able to make well-founded choices.
   So, the strategic value of domestic gardens remains largely
   unquestioned. By developing and applying a mixed methodology that
   combines an existing land use map with empirical data, this study
   provides data and insights on the spatial coverage, distribution and
   growth of domestic garden area in Flanders (the northern region of
   Belgium). The results show that 8\% of the Flemish area is covered by
   domestic gardens, as well as 21\% of the total area of Flemish
   residential cores. The highest concentrations are found in pen-urban
   areas and around ribbon developments. About 8\% of the garden area that
   existed in the period 2002-2005 was new compared to the period 1988-1990
   and occupied mainly former agricultural land (90\%). The results clarify
   the regional significance of domestic gardens in terms of spatial
   coverage. The developed mixed methodology made the domestic garden theme
   analysable. The insights offer an entry point for a debate on the
   strategic value of domestic gardens. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The concept of Smart City (SC) as a means to enhance the life quality of
   citizen has been gaining increasing importance in the agendas of policy
   makers. However, a shared definition of SC is not available and it is
   hard to identify common global trends. This paper provides with a
   comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration
   of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural
   resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living,
   government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of
   smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the
   ratio of domains covered by a city's best practices to the total of
   potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role
   that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables
   might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter
   city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend
   on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and
   structural urban variables are likely to influence a city's digital
   path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density
   of populations with its associated congestion problems, might an
   important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation.
   This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful
   guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions
   towards the most appropriate domains of implementation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Smart Objects and Internet of Things are two ideas that describe the
   future. The interconnection of objects can make them intelligent or
   expand their intelligence. This is achieved by a network that connects
   all the objects in the world. A network where most of the data traffic
   comes from objects instead of people. Cities, houses, cars or any other
   objects that come to life, respond, work and make their owner's life
   easier. This is part of that future. But first, there are many basic
   problems that must be solved. In this paper we propose solutions for
   many of these problems: the interconnection of ubiquitous, heterogeneous
   objects and the generation of applications allow inexperienced people to
   interconnect them. For that purpose, we present three possible
   solutions: a Domain Specific Language capable of abstracting the
   application generation problem; a graphic editor that simplifies the
   creation of that DSL: and an loT platform (Midgar) able to interconnect
   different objects between them. Through Midgar, you can register objects
   and create interconnection between ubiquitous and heterogeneous objects
   through a graphic editor that generates a model defined by the DSL. From
   this model, Midgar generates the interconnection defined by the user
   with the graphical editor. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERFACES}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{ParkPGH is a novel parking application that provides real-time and
   predictive information on the availability of garage parking spaces
   within Pittsburgh's Cultural District. The core of the application is a
   module that collects real-time parking information from the garages by
   tapping into their gate counts. The real-time component is complemented
   by a module that uses historical data and an events calendar to predict
   parking availability. In 2011, visitors to downtown Pittsburgh used
   ParkPGH more than 300,000 times to determine when and where to park. The
   application has also been beneficial to garage operators because the
   information it provides on parking demand affords them greater
   flexibility in addressing contingencies and managing lease holders.
   The deployment of ParkPGH, which includes a robust evaluation component,
   is one piece of a broader transportation ecosystem within the Greater
   Pittsburgh region. The lessons we learned from the initiative, the
   application's relatively low cost, its ease of retrofitting, and its
   open-source platform can enable other cities to lower the costs of
   implementing and managing similar smart-parking solutions and
   significantly shorten their learning curves.}},

   characteristics on residential energy consumption is significantly
   smaller than the corresponding impact from the buildings. However,
   accounting for the indirect impact of household characteristics on
   energy consumption, through choice of the housing unit characteristics,
   the total impact of households on energy consumption is just slightly
   smaller than that of buildings. Outcomes of this paper call for smart

Abstract = {{Cities have an ever increasing wealth of sensing capabilities, recently
   including also internet of things (IoT) systems. However, to fully
   exploit such sensing capabilities with the aim of offering effective
   city-sensing-driven applications still presents certain obstacles.
   Indeed, at present, the main limitation in this respect consists of the
   vast majority of data sources being served on a ``best effort{''} basis.
   To overcome this limitation, we propose a ``resilient and adaptive IoT
   and social sensing platform{''}. Resilience guarantees the accurate,
   timely and dependable delivery of the complete/related data required by
   smart-city applications, while adaptability is introduced to ensure
   optimal handling of the changing requirements during application
   provision. The associated middleware consists of two main sets of
   functionalities: (a) formulation of sensing requests: selection and
   discovery of the appropriate data sources; and (b) establishment and
   control of the necessary resources (e.g., smart objects, networks,
   computing/storage points) on the delivery path from sensing devices to
   the requesting applications. The middleware has the intrinsic feature of
   producing sensing information at a certain level of detail (geographical
   scope/timeliness/accuracy/completeness/dependability) as requested by
   the applications in a given domain. The middleware is assessed and
   validated at a proof-of-concept level through innovative, dependable and
   real-time applications expected to be highly reproducible across
   different cities.}},

Abstract = {{Direct normal irradiance (DNI) plays a key role on the quantity and rate
   of hydrogen production. The accurate calculation of DNI has very
   important significance for low-cost hydrogen economy and efficient
   utilization of solar energy. This study mainly takes account of the
   influence of atmospheric aerosol on DNI and the experimental tests. The
   main idea of this paper is: obtaining the distribution characteristics
   of aerosol particles in the atmosphere and the optical depth of aerosol
   spectrum based on inversion method of ground observation station data;
   calculating the attenuation coefficient of solar spectrum with classical
   Mie scattering theory and particle system radiation characteristics;
   calculating aerosol attenuation coefficient under full spectrum, namely
   the aerosol correction factor (defined as the ratio of the attenuation
   coefficient of aerosol atmosphere to standard atmosphere under full
   spectrum) with Planck model, Rosseland model and Planck Rosseland model
   respectively; choosing with the theoretical calculation model of aerosol
   correction factor based on the solar spectrum radiation calculated by
   SMARTS software; verifying the accuracy of this theoretical model with
   experimental DNI in city Harbin. The results show that there is a good
   agreement with a minimum variation of 3.08\% and a maximum variation of
   9.97\%. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published

Abstract = {{This paper describes how to design systems that support large scale
   collaboration between enterprises on the cloud. To do this, the paper
   proposes an innovative modeling method for large scale collaboration.
   The modeling method identifies the collaborative spaces in the
   collaboration and describes ways to support the collaboration in cloud
   environments, including defining knowledge flows across system
   boundaries.The modeling focuses on the ability to deploy the cloud to
   quickly create collaborative environments. Common access to the cloud
   makes it an enhancer of collaboration, especially across large business
   networks such as outsourcing or co-design and to support the agility
   needed in such collaboration. The paper proposes that cloud provides an
   advantage where it can foster the collaboration needed to maintain
   sustainable communities and defines the support needed from the cloud
   for collaboration. This is particularly relevant to smart cities and the
   greater emphasis on the Internet of things.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Bacterial resistance is a public health problem worldwide
   that seriously compromises the possibility to treat infections.
   Objective: To identify levels of resistance to antibiotic markers in
   Enterobacteriaceae isolates from Colombian hospitals.
   Materials and methods: A systematic literature survey was done including
   articles indexed in Medline, Embase and LILACS. A manual search was made
   of Colombian scientific journals and other publications on infectious
   disease that were not available electronically.
   Results: In total, 43 observational studies and epidemiological reports
   were identified with information about resistance among
   Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Colombian hospitals, mainly from Bogota,
   Cali and Medellin. The resistance rate of Escherichia coli ranges from 3
   to 11\%, 5 to 20\% and from 0.2 to 0.8\% for piperacillin-tazobactam,
   third generation cephalosporins and carbapenems, respectively. For
   Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance rates ranges from 21.8 to 48.1\% to
   piperacillin-tazobactam, 20 to 35\% to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and
   3 to 8\% to carbapenems, with significant variations by cities, levels
   of care and clinical settings.
   Conclusions: The spread of bacterial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae
   isolated in Colombian hospitals is a growing problem that calls for
   priority action to cut the chains of transmission.}},

Abstract = {{The problems now facing Japan, such as an energy shortage and a falling
   birthrate combined with an aging population, are problems that other
   countries around the world will eventually have to face. Japan is thus
   in a position to be a front runner in solving these problems and thereby
   become a leader in solving problems and treating a new society. To help
   Japan play this role, Fujitsu is promoting Smart Cities in which
   information and communications technology (ICT) is used to contribute to
   society and people's lives. Fujitsu's idea for creating a Smart City is
   to realize smarter energy usage and social infrastructures by using ICT,
   to have discussions with communities in order to resolve local issues,
   to find ways to revitalize communities, and to develop a means of
   sustainably circulating social values through ICT. This paper outlines
   Fujitsu's approach to Smart Cities and presents its approach to
   developing solutions to problems in different industrial fields. It also
   describes demonstration experiments in which Fujitsu is participating.
   Energy solutions that provide an infrastructure for Smart Cities are
   also described.}},

   the value and environmental impact of cities as a whole, and enhancing a
   quantitative evaluation method for introducing Id T solutions to cities.
   We have developed a quantitative evaluation method focusing on the
   efficiency of a city (degree of smartness) and effect that Id T has on a

Abstract = {{The use of traditional positioning technologies, such as GPS and
   wireless local positioning, rely on underlying infrastructure. However,
   in a subway environment, such positioning systems are not available for
   the positioning tasks, such as the detection of the train arrivals for
   the passengers in the train. An alternative approach is to exploit the
   contextual information available in the mobile devices of subway riders
   to detect train arrivals. To this end, we propose to exploit multiple
   contextual features extracted from the mobile devices of subway riders
   to precisely detecting train arrivals. Following this line, we first
   investigate potential contextual features which may be effective to
   detect train arrivals according to the observations from 3D
   accelerometers and GSM radio. Furthermore, we propose to explore the
   maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model for training a train arrival detector by
   learning the correlation between contextual features and train arrivals.
   Finally, we perform extensive experiments on several real-world data
   sets collected from two major subway lines in the Beijing subway system.
   Experimental results validate both the effectiveness and efficiency of
   the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{New Urbanism and Smart Growth are relatively new approaches to urban
   design that deals with environmental problems, housing issues, and
   community well-being. The implementation feasibility and significance of
   the planning ideas however can vary from place to place. Based on the
   planning principles of New Urbanism and Smart Growth, this study
   rigorously and realistically identifies key principles and investigates
   their relative importance for the planning and designing of the National
   Taipei University District (Taiwan). An extraction model first elicits
   knowledge from experts for the purpose of locating key principles. Next,
   key principles are fed into a simulation model to identify which of the
   principles should take precedence. This permitted an explicit
   consideration of local characteristics and background issues in the
   planning process. Results show that walkability is perceived by experts
   as the most important principle. While providing for various
   transportation options is found to be important to the development of
   the study area, green transportation is clearly not included. These
   findings suggest that the concept of sustainability is still very
   abstract and has not become an important planning criterion. Also,
   stakeholder engagement may be vital to community development planning
   such as the City of Irvine in the United States, but it is less
   important in Asian city-region. The results also show a less important
   role open space preservation has in creating better communities in a
   small island with a high population density like Taiwan. Thus, although
   New Urbanism and Smart Growth principles have important impacts on urban
   design, local circumstances must be taken into account instead of merely
   following the principles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper analyses the concept of the smart city in critical
   perspective, focusing on the power/knowledge implications for the
   contemporary city. On the one hand, smart city policies support new ways
   of imagining, organising and managing the city and its flows; on the
   other, they impress a new moral order on the city by introducing
   specific technical parameters in order to distinguish between the `good'
   and `bad' city. The smart city discourse may therefore be a powerful
   tool for the production of docile subjects and mechanisms of political
   legitimisation. The paper is largely based on theoretical reflections
   and uses smart city politics in Italy as a case study. The paper
   analyses how the smart city discourse proposed by the European Union has
   been reclassified to produce new visions of the `good city' and the role
   of private actors and citizens in the management of urban development.}},

Abstract = {{With the expansion and infilling of urban areas, the demand for electric
   power is driving the design and capacity of distribution substations to
   their thermal limits. Distribution transformer substations are
   increasingly required to be compact, reliable, safe, and intelligent. To
   efficiently utilize city space and to support the intermittent load
   flows imposed by smart-grid features, such as distributed generation,
   the transformers are expected to operate close to or occasionally over
   their ratings, with stalled or little air circulation inside the safety
   enclosure. Dynamic thermal models with physically validated convection
   and radiation heat-transfer components are essential for the real-time
   thermal rating of substations. Natural convection via the air inside the
   cabin to the outside ambient air plays the major role in cooling down a
   transformer. In this study a scale model of a prefabricated substation
   is examined to draft a numerical solution which is based on stack
   ventilation principles. A clear and expandable first principle approach
   is used to quantify heat transfer through ventilation openings.
   Measurements from actual cabins and 3-D finite element method
   simulations are used to validate the numerical model.}},

Abstract = {{Besides responding to challenges of rapid urbanization and growing
   traffic congestion, the development of smart transport systems has
   attracted much attention in recent times. Many promising initiatives
   have emerged over the years. Despite these initiatives, there is still a
   lack of understanding about an appropriate definition of smart transport
   system. As such, it is challenging to identify the appropriate
   indicators of `smartness'. This paper proposes a comprehensive and
   practical framework to benchmark cities according to the smartness in
   their transportation systems. The proposed methodology was illustrated
   using a set of data collected from 26 cities across the world through
   web search and contacting relevant transport authorities and agencies.
   Results showed that London, Seattle and Sydney were among the world's
   top smart transport cities. In particular, Seattle and Paris ranked high
   in smart private transport services while London and Singapore scored
   high on public transport services. London also appeared to be the
   smartest in terms of emergency transport services. The key value of the
   proposed innovative framework lies in a comparative analysis among
   cities, facilitating city-to-city learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   phone-based system to track a driver's trajectory to detect when they
   are about to leave their parking spot. We focus on the efficiency and
   accuracy of using a phone to monitor the driver's walking trajectory,
   applying a waist-mounted PDR method that can measure the driver's moving
   distance with a high accuracy. In addition, we design a map matching
   algorithm to calibrate the direction errors when the driver is in an
   indoor environment, using widely-available building floor plans. The
   results of our experiment show that we can achieve about 98\% accuracy

   that IoT-powered smart cities stand better chances of becoming healthier

   project, one of the projects of the Future Internet Research and
   Experimentation initiative of the European Commission and represents a
   unique in the world city-scale experimental research facility.
   Additionally, this facility supports typical applications and services
   of a smart city. Tangible results are expected to influence the
   definition and specification of Future Internet architecture design from
   viewpoints of Internet of Things and Internet of Services. The facility
   comprises a large number of Internet of Things devices deployed in
   several urban scenarios which will be federated into a single testbed.
   In this paper the deployment being carried out at the main location,
   namely Santander city, is described. Besides presenting the current
   deployment, in this article the main insights in terms of the
   architectural design of a large-scale IoT testbed are presented as well.
   Furthermore, solutions adopted for implementation of the different
   components addressing the required testbed functionalities are also
   sketched out. The IoT experimentation facility described in this paper
   is conceived to provide a suitable platform for large scale
   experimentation and evaluation of IoT concepts under real-life

Title = {{Merit aid and post-college retention in the state}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{39-50}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{One goal of state merit-based financial aid programs is to increase the
   stock of college-educated labor in the state by retaining
   college-educated persons in the state after college. However, there has
   been surprisingly little research on whether state merit aid programs
   are effective at this goal. This paper investigates the effect of state
   merit aid programs on the post-college location of 24-30 year olds. We
   use decennial census and American Community Survey microdata to consider
   post-college retention effects in the 25 states that implemented merit
   aid programs between 1991 and 2004. Our preferred specification implies
   that strong state merit aid programs on average increase the probability
   that a college attendee lives in his or her birth state during ages
   24-30 by 2.76 percentage points. We also estimate the effect for
   individual states and find meaningful differences across states in the
   effect of merit aid programs on in-state post-college retention and
   explore explanations for these differences. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

   design and data innovations provide new insights into local
   administrators' willingness to grant access to economic development

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{761-768}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Among many significant smart grid initiatives and challenges considered
   by many utilities and within the research community, are those
   associated with the energy management and conservation, in particular
   the management of energy demand during peak load periods. In this paper,
   a novel method for peak load curtailment by using a fuzzy system
   approach is presented. The proposed method is based on the application
   of fuzzy logic principles for peak load curtailment in a smart grid
   environment. The inputs to the system are the utility peak load data
   consisting of many energy demand scenarios, and the outputs are the
   necessary demand response power reductions required for the load
   curtailment during the peak load periods. The proposed method considers
   different peak load profiles and power consumption sources for multiple
   city regions. Furthermore, it is adaptable for use in many scenarios,
   such as those encompassing many input sources of power consumption with
   diverse input parameters of control (i.e., temperature offsets, duty
   cycle control, etc.) within numerous city regions. Thus, it can be
   applied to multiple output variables of control.}},

Abstract = {{In a world with an increasing urban population, analysing the
   construction impacts of sanitation infrastructures through Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) is necessary for defining the best environmental
   management strategies. In this study, the environmental impacts of one
   linear meter of sewer constructive solution were analysed for different
   pipe materials and diameters used in Southern Europe; a unit of
   different sewer appurtenances (pump, manhole and inspection chamber) was
   also considered. The impacts of the pipe materials were compared
   considering different lifespan periods and high-density polyethylene
   (HDPE) turned out to be the worst option, being polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
   and concrete the most favourable ones. Few data are available on the
   material and energy flows in the installation stage; therefore, a
   comparative analysis of trenches with sand and concrete bedding was
   conducted. The results show that the installation stage represents up to
   80 \% of the total life-cycle impact of the constructive solutions.
   Concrete pipes with half-concrete/half-sand bedding are the best option
   and produce 20-30 \% of the impact of HDPE pipes with concrete bedding.
   Hence, designers should focus not only on the pipe but also on the
   trench model. A methodology was presented to enable the impact
   aggregation of the different sewer elements, and Betanzos (Spain) was
   selected to conduct a pilot study in small cities. In the future,
   studies will need to incorporate the use and maintenance stage, as it is
   not standard and varies according to the physical features of the
   cities. Finally, this study provides basic concepts for developing
   eco-efficiency indicators.}},

Abstract = {{Data analytics in smart grids can be leveraged to channel the data
   downpour from individual meters into knowledge valuable to electric
   power utilities and end-consumers. Short-term load forecasting (STLF)
   can address issues vital to a utility but it has traditionally been done
   mostly at system (city or country) level. In this case study, we exploit
   rich, multi-year, and high-frequency annotated data collected via a
   metering infrastructure to perform STLF on aggregates of power meters in
   a mid-sized city. For smart meter aggregates complemented with
   geo-specific weather data, we benchmark several state-of-the-art
   forecasting algorithms, including kernel methods for nonlinear
   regression, seasonal and temperature-adjusted auto-regressive models,
   exponential smoothing and state-space models. We show how STLF accuracy
   improves at larger meter aggregation (at feeder, substation, and
   system-wide level). We provide an overview of our algorithms for load
   prediction and discuss system performance issues that impact real time
   STLF. (c) 2014 Alcatel-Lucent.}},

Abstract = {{There is a trend that different computing paradigms such as cloud
   computing, pervasive, and mobile computing are converging with each
   other. Due to this convergence, there arise unprecedented complexities,
   such as huge number of computing devices, flexibilities and adaptation
   of service infrastructure (infrastructure elasticity) for fitting
   dynamics of large smart city applications, expectations of powerful
   computing and storage capabilities on handhold devices, and so on.
   Therefore, a supporting infrastructure is needed, which can flexibly
   switch services at run time and can be used to enhance capabilities for
   small devices through component/service migrations. In this paper, we
   propose an elastic open service gateway initiative (OSGO-based pervasive
   cloud (OSGi-PC) infrastructure which can make use of both the cloud
   computing capabilities and the component flexibilities from OSGi.
   OSGi-PC provides flexible management of component migrations between
   small devices themselves and powerful nodes in between, which is
   remaining a critical challenge for enabling mobile clouds. We have
   evaluated the OSGi-PC in terms of performance for adaptive service
   provision, and power consumption during service adaptation, performance
   and power consumption for component migrations in different scenarios,
   which show the usability of OSGi-PC.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to present the stages of development for an
   information technology integration model for the design of systems for
   smart cities. The Introduction explains the need for integration
   technologies and presents a model for selecting integration technologies
   and the conditions for its use in designing smart cities systems. Then
   two verification stages of the presented model are discussed. In the
   first stage, the model underwent a replicative verification in the
   Eureka project, the purpose of which was to build fuzzy decision-making
   scenarios for the needs of smart cities. In the second stage, the
   developed model underwent a predictive verification process that aimed
   at selecting integration technologies (suggested by the developed model)
   in the construction of an intelligent operating center (IOC)
   decision-making system. The article is summarized with conclusions and
   observations about the importance of integration technologies and the
   possibility of predicting them.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial agglomerations have long been thought to offer economic and
   social benefits to firms and people that are only captured by location
   within their specified geographies. Using the case study of New York
   City's garment industry along with data acquired from cell phones and
   social media, this study set out to understand the discrete activities
   underpinning the economic dynamics of an industrial agglomeration. Over
   a two week period, data was collected by employing the geo-locative
   capabilities of Foursquare, a social media application, to record every
   movement of fashion workers employed at fashion design firms located
   both inside and outside the geographical boundaries of New York City's
   Garment District. This unique method of studying worker activity exposed
   the day-to-day dynamics of an industrial district with a precision thus
   far undocumented in literature. Our work suggests that having access to
   the cluster provides almost the same agglomeration economies as residing
   within its borders.}},

Title = {{Detection and Spatial Mapping of Mercury Contamination in Water Samples
   Using a Smart-Phone}},

Abstract = {{Detection of environmental contamination such as trace-level toxic heavy
   metal ions mostly relies on bulky and costly analytical instruments.
   However, a considerable global need exists for portable, rapid,
   specific, sensitive, and cost-effective detection techniques that can be
   used in resource-limited and field settings. Here we introduce a
   smart-phone-based hand-held platform that allows the quantification of
   mercury(II) ions in water samples with parts per billion (ppb) level of
   sensitivity. For this task, we created an integrated opto-mechanical
   attachment to the built-in camera module of a smart-phone to digitally
   quantify mercury concentration using a plasmonic gold nanoparticle (Au
   NP) and aptamer based colorimetric transmission assay that is
   implemented in disposable test tubes. With this smart-phone attachment
   that weighs <40 g, we quantified mercury(II) ion concentration in water
   samples by using a two-color ratiometric method employing light-emitting
   diodes (LEDs) at 523 and 625 nm, where a custom-developed smart
   application was utilized to process each acquired transmission image on
   the same phone to achieve a limit of detection of similar to 3.5 ppb.
   Using this smart-phone-based detection platform, we generated a mercury
   contamination map by measuring water samples at over 50 locations in
   California (USA), taken from city tap water sources, rivers, lakes, and
   beaches. With its cost-effective design, field-portability, and wireless
   data connectivity, this sensitive and specific heavy metal detection
   platform running on cellphones could be rather useful for distributed
   sensing, tracking, and sharing of water contamination information as a
   function of both space and time.}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{MES (multi-energy systems) whereby electricity, heat, cooling, fuels,
   transport, and so on optimally interact with each other at various
   levels (for instance, within a district, city or region) represent an
   important opportunity to increase technical, economic and environmental
   performance relative to ``classical{''} energy systems whose sectors are
   treated ``separately{''} or ``independently{''}. This performance
   improvement can take place at both the operational and the planning
   stage. While such systems and in particular systems with distributed
   generation of multiple energy vectors (DMG (distributed
   multigeneration)) can be a key option to decarbonize the energy sector,
   the approaches needed to model and relevant tools to analyze them are
   often of great complexity. Likewise, it is not straightforward to
   identify performance metrics that are capable to properly capture costs
   and benefits that are relating to various types of MES according to
   different criteria. The aim of this invited paper is thus to provide the
   reader with a comprehensive and critical overview of the latest models
   and assessment techniques that are currently available to analyze MES
   and in particular DMG systems, including for instance concepts such as
   energy hubs, microgrids, and VPPs (virtual power plants), as well as
   various approaches and criteria for energy, environmental, and
   techno-economic assessment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Macro economic impact, reduction of fee deficit and profitability of a

   of Leon (Spain)}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{The Spanish economy faces two key issues. The first of these is the
   significant reliance on non-renewable energy, which reached 76.4\% and
   was 22 points over the European Union average. Secondly, the threat that
   the fee deficit poses to the sustainability of the National Grid. This
   fact is forcing the Spanish Government to implement measures focused on
   tax increases. However, these decisions have done little to contain the
   situation. This paper proposes the use of sustainable transport models
   based on electric mobility: smart grids, buses, taxis and electric
   vehicles, in the city of Leon, Spain (135,059 inhabitants) as an
   important means for controlling and reducing the fee deficit. Through
   exhaustive analysis of EV (electric vehicle) market penetration against
   current Government forecasts, a rigorous profitability study has been
   conducted for the period 2020-2030 (when smart grids will be ready). By
   introducing policy modifications, the Net Actual Value internal rate of
   return and payback figures justify its implementation. Thus, the fee
   deficit of Leon could be reduced by up to 43\%. Finally, an analysis of
   macroeconomic impacts, such as competitive improvements in the economy,
   and environmental impact is conducted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The application of Internet-enabled devices in the real world for the
   development of Smart Cities, environmental monitoring, bus tracking, and

   resources to reach a suitable ecosystem for data acquisition and
   interaction with citizens. Internet of things needs to offer efficient
   support for global communications and access to services and
   information. It needs to enable homogeneous and seamless
   machine-to-machine communication for different solutions and
   applications. This work presents an homogeneous and suitable mechanism
   for global resource discovery, device access for deployed smart objects
   in different scenarios, and sensors and devices from end users
   (participative sensing). The integration of legacy and sensors already
   available from smart buildings and smart objects is presented. For this
   purpose, a resolution infrastructure called ``digcovery{''} is defined
   for maximizing efficiency and sustainability of deployments. Digcovery
   architecture offers the framework to allow users to register/include
   their own sensors into a common infrastructure and access/discover the

Abstract = {{A ``Smart City{''} is intended as an urban environment which, supported
   by pervasive ICT systems, is able to offer advanced and innovative
   services to citizens in order to improve the overall quality of their
   life. In this context, the present contribution formulates a pioneering
   proposal, by drawing an advanced information centric platform for
   supporting the typical ICT services of a Smart City. It can easily
   embrace all available and upcoming wireless technologies, while
   enforcing, at the same time, ubiquitous and secure applications in many
   domains, such as, e-government and public administration, intelligent
   transportation systems, public safety, social, health-care, educational,
   building and urban planning, environmental, and energy and water
   management applications. All the details of the proposed approach have
   been carefully described by means of pragmatical use-cases, such as the
   management of administrative procedures, the starting of a new business
   in a given country, the navigation assistance, the signaling of an urban
   accident aimed at improving the public safety, the reservation of a
   medical examination, the remote assistance of patients, and the
   management of waste in a city. This description makes evident the real
   effectiveness of the present proposal in future urban environments. (C)

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incorporate transparently
   and seamlessly a large number of different and heterogeneous end
   systems, while providing open access to selected subsets of data for the
   development of a plethora of digital services. Building a general
   architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of
   the extremely large variety of devices, link layer technologies, and
   services that may be involved in such a system. In this paper, we focus
   specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a
   broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain.
   Urban IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision,
   which aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies to
   support added-value services for the administration of the city and for
   the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the
   enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT.
   Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss the technical solutions
   and best-practice guidelines adopted in the Padova Smart City project, a
   proof-of-concept deployment of an IoT island in the city of Padova,
   Italy, performed in collaboration with the city municipality.}},

Abstract = {{Intelligent metering technology combined with advanced numerical
   techniques enable a paradigm shift in the current level of water
   consumption information provision that is available to the customer and
   the water business. The aim of this study was to develop an autonomous
   and intelligent system for residential water end-use classification that
   could interface with customers and water business managers via a
   user-friendly web-based application. Water flow data collected directly
   from smart water meters includes both single (e.g., a shower event
   occurring alone) and combined (i.e., an event that comprises several
   overlapping single events) water end use events. The authors recently
   developed intelligent algorithms to solve the complex problem of
   autonomously categorising residential water consumption data into a
   registry of single and combined events using a hybrid combination of
   techniques including Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Dynamic Time Warping
   (DTW) algorithm, time-of-day probability functions, threshold values and
   various physical features. However, the issue still remained, which is
   the focus of this current paper, on how to integrate self-learning
   functionality into the visioned expert system, in order that it can
   learn from newly collected datasets from different cities, regions and
   countries, to that collected for the training data. Such versatility and
   adaptive capacity is essential to make the expert system widely
   applicable. Through applying alternate forms of HMM and DTW in
   association with a frequency analysis technique, a suitable
   self-learning methodology was formulated and tested on three independent
   households located in Melbourne, Australia with a prediction accuracy of
   between 80\% and 90\% for the major end-use categories. The three
   principle flow data processing modules (i.e., single and combined event
   recognition and self-learning function) were integrated into a prototype
   software application for performing autonomous water end-use analysis
   and its functionality is presented in the latter sections of this paper.
   The developed expert system has profound implications for government,
   water businesses and consumers, seeking to better manage precious urban
   water resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   sample size than in most other studies. The study found that Beijing's
   bus commuters had a shorter actual required commute (ARC) and a shorter
   minimum required commute (MRC) than commuters in four other
   auto-dependent Western cities with comparable population and land use
   size. The study also indicated that Beijing's bus commuters had a longer
   ARC and a longer MRC than commuters of all modes in Guangzhou, a
   metropolis in southern China half the size of Beijing. Consultations
   with local experts, field surveys, and information provided by online
   housing search engines were used to supplement the smart card data. The

Title = {{Fleet Sizing for Flexible Carsharing Systems Simulation-Based Approach}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2416}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Abstract = {{In the past 10 to 15 years, carsharing has attracted significant
   attention as a green transportation alternative that can reduce car
   dependence and promote smarter, healthier mode choice in urban areas.
   Despite rapid growth and aggressive funding, carsharing remains a niche
   product with quantifiable but relatively small benefits. A new type of
   carsharing seeks to expand its reach, and perhaps its benefits, by
   eliminating some of the inconveniences of traditional services, such as
   having to book in advance and having to return the car to the same
   location. Flexible carsharing, pioneered by Daimler's car2go program in
   late 2008, also introduces a logistical problem not present in
   traditional carsharing: the spatial distribution of vehicles tends to be
   irregular because of the randomness of demand. Vehicle redistribution,
   which can be done periodically (e.g., at the end of the day) or
   continuously, can be used to ameliorate this problem. By using an
   agent-based model of a flexible carsharing system, this research
   explores the trade-offs between fleet size and hired vehicle
   redistributors, with the objective of maximizing the demand level that
   can be satisfactorily served. Production functions for representative
   city sizes and demand densities are presented. Finally, the results of
   the simulation are compared with actual data from car2go's Austin,
   Texas, operation. The comparison shows that the simulation results are
   reasonably close to the measured performance of one-way carsharing in
   Austin.}},

Title = {{Calibration of Rail Transit Assignment Model with Automated Fare
   Collection Data and a Parallel Genetic Algorithm}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Pages = {{20-28}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, cities around the world have begun to use automated
   fare collection (AFC) systems with smart card technologies as the main
   method of collecting urban rail transit (URT) fares. Transaction data
   obtained through these AFC systems contain a large amount of archived
   information about how passengers use the URT system. These data can be
   used to calibrate assignment models for precise passenger flow
   calculations. However, this calibration typically is a computationally
   intensive problem because of multiroute searches, iteration strategies,
   and especially massive AFC data sets. This paper proposes a methodology
   for calibrating URT assignment models with AFC data and a parallel
   genetic algorithm. The calibration approach uses a framework based on a
   parallel genetic algorithm with nonparametric statistical techniques,
   which calibrate assignment model parameters by comparing observed and
   calculated travel time distributions. In initial case studies on the URT
   network in Beijing, the proposed approach found reasonable solutions for
   the calibrated parameters.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{630-637}},
Abstract = {{A city may become smart and green through strategic deployment of
   Information and Communication Technology infrastructure and services to
   achieve sustainability policy objectives in which trees have to be
   involved. Plants not only constitute green space useful to contrast
   urban pollution effects or provide ecosystemic benefits to residents but
   they can also be used as bioindicators and their involvement in
   communication networks can represent a significant contribution to build
   a smart, green city. The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT)
   envisages that objects that surround us will be connected and there are
   no reasons to exclude urban trees from among the ``wired object{''}.
   Radio frequency identification devices (RFID) may represent a
   prerequisite of IoT application and they can be used for tree protection
   and management, thanks to tagging experience carried out on various
   plant species. RFID tags can be easily associated with plants,
   externally or internally. This latter approach is particularly indicated
   if the identification of trees needs to be secured since its production,
   eliminating the risk of tag losses or removal. Interesting applications
   may be derived by implementing RFID tags in biomonitoring systems in
   order to guarantee a real-time data communication in which tags may act
   as antennas for multifunctional green spaces. Moreover, the
   virtualization of green areas using sensors and mobile devices can lead
   to the desktop management of the urban green with the possibility of
   implementing a real-time navigation throughout the areas. A complex
   relational network in which data can be collected thanks to geospatial
   methods can be integrated by an IoT approach in which RFID-plants can
   play a significant role. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{869-885}},
Abstract = {{Drawing upon Michel Foucault's approach to power and governmentality,
   this paper explores the internal logics and dynamics of
   software-mediated techniques used to regulate and manage urban systems.
   Our key questions are as follows: what power and regulatory dynamics do
   contemporary smart-city initiatives imply? And how do smart information
   technologies intervene in the governing of everyday life? Building on
   the Foucauldian distinction between apparatuses of discipline and
   apparatuses of security, the paper approaches these questions on three
   broad levels, namely: how contemporary `governing through code' relates
   to its referent object (referentiality axis), to normalisation
   (normativity axis), and to space (spatiality axis). Empirically, the
   paper investigates two high-profile pilot projects in Switzerland in the
   field of smart electricity management, aimed at (1) the assessment of
   customer needs and behaviours with regard to novel smart metering
   solutions (iSMART), and (2) the elaboration of novel IT solutions in the
   field of smart electricity grids for optimised load management
   (Flexlast).}},

Volume = {{46}},

Pages = {{803-819}},
Abstract = {{Climate change and advances in urban technology propel forward the
   `smart city'. As decision makers strive to find a technological fix,
   smart city strategies are often based on technological orthodoxies which
   are conceptually and empirically shallow. The motivation behind this
   paper is to address the conceptual adolescence which relates to the
   wholesale digitisation of the city by pursuing a twin argument about the
   democratic and environmental consequences. The authors draw on
   interdisciplinary theory and insights from urban studies,
   infrastructure, informatics, and the sociology of the Internet to
   critique the way the `smart city' is taken forward. It is concluded that
   private firms market smart city services and solutions based on an
   ideological legacy of `ubiquitous computing', `universal
   infrastructure', and `green technology'. Based on evidence from three UK
   cities-Manchester, Birmingham, and Glasgow-it is argued that the
   underlying principle of future city strategies is to expand the market
   for new technology products and services to support `green growth' with
   disregard for their wider impacts. For citizens, becoming a consumer of
   the technologies is often presented as progressive `participation' or
   `empowerment' with unknown or hidden consequences both political and
   environmental. The city systems become a digital marketplace where
   citizen-consumers' participation is increasingly involuntary and the
   hegemony of global technology firms is inflated. What follows is that
   the city's `intelligent systems' are defined through a digital consumer
   experience that has inherent biases and leaves parts of the city and its
   population unaccounted for. This renders the city less resilient in the
   face of future social and climatic risks.}},

Title = {{Compact development without transit: life-cycle GHG emissions from four
   variations of residential density in Vancouver}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1226-1243}},
Abstract = {{Numerous studies have shown that compact, mixed-use, transit-oriented
   developments contribute to reduced use of automobiles and in turn
   contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions. When everyday destinations
   are within walking distance, people are more likely to walk or cycle,
   and if transit is within walking distance people are more likely to use
   it. Other studies have shown that compact development enables reductions
   in building energy consumption that contribute further to emissions
   savings. The reduced emissions are assumed to rely on the combination of
   compactness and transit connectedness. However, this combination
   requires an extensive transit network covering large areas both of
   residential and of employment destinations. Such networks often do not
   exist and are too costly to construct. When they do exist, the transit
   networks often do not reach those outlying neighbourhoods with the
   greatest potential for future growth and densification. This paper
   therefore asks what emissions savings compact development can achieve in
   the absence of high-frequency transit. In an examinination of the
   life-cycle emissions of four variations of density in three different
   neighbourhoods in Vancouver, none of which is well served by transit, we
   found a wide range of emissions profiles. A mixed-use new urbanist
   development produced 22\% fewer emissions than an adjacent development
   of large single-family homes, both of which were in a transit-poor area
   on the far edge of a suburban city. A high-density neighbourhood
   adjacent to a suburban city centre, and one adjacent to a central city
   centre, produced 50\% and 67\% fewer emissions than the neighbourhood of
   large single-family homes. Findings suggest that, while compactness may
   be most effective when it is coupled with high frequency transit,
   decoupling the pair and building compactness before or without transit
   can still yield considerable household emissions reductions.}},

   the assemblage of streetlighting infrastructure}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2228-2242}},
Abstract = {{To dim or not to dim? That is the choice that streetlighting engineers
   across the world are currently having to make. In the context of
   austerity politics, increased local-scale responsibility for
   climate-change mitigation and the emergence of technological
   developments, this choice of how to provide streetlighting has become
   newly politicised. In particular, new opportunities for streetlighting
   practice, including the use of efficient LED lighting and `computer
   management systems' for controlling smart urban lighting, have emerged.
   This research paper draws from the concept of assemblage in order to
   argue that the practices of developing policy knowledge in this area of
   technological change need to be connected with understandings of lived
   experiences of infrastructure. Through interviews conducted with
   lighting engineers at local authorities in England, I explore the
   techniques and practices involved in generating the knowledge required
   to make choices with regards to new technologies and innovative
   practices. In particular, I argue that, while drawing on experiments and
   trials allows local authority lighting engineers to measure and
   understand certain features of an assemblage, it also leaves a
   significant gap with regards to the more tacit and experiential ways in
   which people engage with infrastructure on a day-to-day basis. This
   results in a number of uncertainties which local authority staff are
   aware of, but which they struggle to overcome. As such, this research
   comments on the difficulties inherent to understanding assemblages, and
   the ways in which choices are made at the intersection of energy policy,
   social governance, and technological innovation.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{586-595}},
Abstract = {{Expected population growth will result in increasing water demand. The
   consequences could potentially jeopardise water resource availability
   especially in urban areas and significantly increase costs. Rainwater
   harvesting (RWH) systems can aid not only in meeting water demand
   partially, but also doing so in a more cost-effective and
   environmentally friendly manner than other techniques. Although the
   reduction of environmental burdens is fairly obvious, the question for
   urban planners and consumers remains: are RWH systems economically
   feasible? This paper investigates cost-effectiveness of eight different
   scenarios in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. To do so, monetary
   investment is quantified to provide rainwater for laundry purposes.
   Results indicate that high density scenarios are financially the most
   suitable choices (higher net present value and shorter payback time)
   given that: more users mean more savings from laundry additive
   consumption. Further studies should consider which are the variables
   that have a greater effect on the financial appraisal. Similar to
   inflation rate, specific attention should be paid to the costs
   associated with the storage tank location. Included on the savings side
   should be the no tap water consumption effect on the water bill, along
   with special attention to tap water prices in the area of study.}},

Abstract = {{Significant attention has been given in urban policy literature to the
   integration of land-use and transport planning and policies-with a view
   to curbing sprawling urban form and diminishing externalities associated
   with car-dependent travel patterns. By taking land-use and transport
   interaction into account, this debate mainly focuses on how a successful
   integration can contribute to societal well-being, providing efficient
   and balanced economic growth while accomplishing the goal of developing
   sustainable urban environments and communities. The integration is also
   a focal theme of contemporary urban development models, such as smart
   growth, liveable neighbourhoods, and new urbanism. Even though available
   planning policy options for ameliorating urban form and
   transport-related externalities have matured-owing to growing research
   and practice worldwide-there remains a lack of suitable evaluation
   models to reflect on the current status of urban form and travel
   problems or on the success of implemented integration policies. In this
   study we explore the applicability of indicator-based spatial indexing
   to assess land-use and transport integration at the neighbourhood level.
   For this, a spatial index is developed by a number of indicators
   compiled from international studies and trialled in Gold Coast,
   Queensland, Australia. The results of this modelling study reveal that
   it is possible to propose an effective metric to determine the success
   level of city plans considering their sustainability performance via
   composite indicator methodology. The model proved useful in demarcating
   areas where planning intervention is applicable, and in identifying the
   most suitable locations for future urban development and plan
   amendments. Lastly, we integrate variance-based sensitivity analysis
   with the spatial indexing method, and discuss the applicability of the
   model in other urban contexts.}},

   industrial interest in the last years, with several successful
   experiences of development and deployment. Notwithstanding this high
   interest and the relevant research activities accomplished in the field,
   there are still many open technical challenges calling for additional
   research efforts. In this paper, we focus on the ability of PUB/SUB
   infrastructures to offer cost-effective, scalable, and quality-aware
   data distribution in emerging wide-scale and highly dynamic
   communication environments, such as those related to the continuous
   exchange of information between static and mobile nodes in smart-city
   scenarios. To this purpose, we survey state-of-the-art industrial and
   academic PUB/SUB solutions, with a strong focus on their support to
   scalability and quality requirements. We offer a detailed technical
   analysis of existing mechanisms and techniques for scalable QoS
   provisioning in PUB/SUB middleware, and we show how different
   design/implementation details impact the scalability and quality
   achievable at runtime. At the end of this surveying work, we identify
   promising guidelines for future research and for PUB/SUB systems
   extensions to effectively address the technical challenges of
   scalability and quality.}},

Abstract = {{Land use policy can generate substantial conflict between pro-growth and
   slow-growth interests. Based on the collaborative planning model, one of
   the many roles of the professional planner is to mediate conflict and
   generate support among fragmented interests in policy aimed at
   mitigating the effects from sprawl. The analysis uses original data
   collected from cities and towns in the state of Massachusetts. This
   study empirically tests the effect a divergence between local interest
   groups in the support for planning efforts has on the adoption of smart
   growth policy. Methodologically, interaction terms are used to test the
   hypothesis that local planning capacity, in the form of professional
   planning staff and formal planning mechanisms, mediates this divergence.
   The results provide insight into how communities can overcome the
   challenges of interest group divergence in planning for `smarter' growth
   and more sustainable environmental land use practices.}},

Abstract = {{Blackouts-the total loss of electrical power-serve as a reminder of how
   dependent the modern world and particularly urban areas have become on
   electricity and the appliances it powers. To understand them we consider
   the critical nature of electrical infrastructure. In order to provide
   general patterns from specific cases, a large number of blackouts have
   been analyzed. Irrespective of cause, they display similar effects.
   These include measurable economic losses and less easily quantified
   social costs. We discuss financial damage, food safety, crime,
   transport, and problems caused by diesel generators. This is more than
   just a record of past failures; blackouts are dress rehearsals for the
   future in which they will appear with greater frequency and severity.
   While energy cannot be destroyed, exergy-the available energy within a
   system-can be. Exergy is concerned with energy within an
   ``environment;{''} in this case a city. The bottom line is simple: no
   matter how ``smart{''} a city may be, it becomes ``dumb{''} when the

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{33-55}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Despite the growing literature aimed at explaining how
   cultural and artistic production feeds economic growth, the causal
   relationships and interplays are not investigated in depth. In the
   attempt of filling this gap, the purpose of this paper is to examine
   arts, culture, and education within the framework of the New Growth
   Theory.
   Design/methodology/approach - Starting from the analysis of how culture
   may be at the root of a specific engine of economic growth, the paper
   presents a theoretical endogenous growth model driven by the combination
   of the investments in human and cultural capital.
   Findings - The paper shows that cultural investment has a positive
   impact on economic growth and on the level of income provided that the
   economy is sufficiently ``culture-intensive{''}, and that this effect is
   further magnified the more total factor productivity (TFP) is sensitive
   to the stock of cultural capital.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper figures out the
   possibility of a cultural poverty trap as the cause of poor growth
   performance of some economies in the current post-industrial scenario.
   Culturally poor economies tend to grow slowly because of the lack of
   cultural exposure, which makes TFP poor since human capita is weakly
   inclined to be used in innovative, flexible ways.
   Originality/value - The paper presents a new endogenous growth model.
   The paper argues that the available endogenous growth models fail to
   take into account the full set of relevant factors that make endogenous
   growth possible, and that the missing entry is cultural capital.}},

Abstract = {{As the effects of global warming are spreading all over the planet, the
   activities on monitoring the environment are getting on importance and
   are becoming the focus of many projects, in particular those targeting
   development of smart cities and smart societies in general. Development
   of technology is enabling implementation of low-cost environment
   monitoring systems that can be installed across the cities utilizing the
   existing city infrastructure (for example attached to lampposts or
   installed on public transport vehicles) or even carried around by
   individuals contributing to crowd sourced based monitoring solutions.
   However, even though the costs are significantly lower than just a few
   years ago, it is still prohibitive to deploy such systems on a very
   large scale. This paper presents a possible approach towards significant
   reduction of the number of measurement points as well as the number of
   required sensors while still providing reliable estimations of
   environment parameters across an area. The approach is based on the
   mathematical statistics methods. It is shown that the proposed solution
   works well in the areas with stable and slowly-changing weather
   conditions, i.e. in cases when there are no sudden climate changes.}},

Title = {{A Study on the Security Algorithm for Contexts in Smart Cities}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Recently, a great number of smart devices associated with their users
   exist within Smart City. Users are constantly moving around within Smart
   City according to their plans and consequently receive various network
   services from hosting devices adjacent. Currently, there are numbers of
   different types of security algorithms related to those activities;
   moreover, under such complexity of digital environment including various
   network devices and users, selective and customised services need to be
   provided for suitable purposes. However, the provided services are to be
   secured and well protected. Each customised service usually keeps
   tailored security policy and algorithm. Conventionally, every service
   including different servers, network, and users employs the same
   security algorithm so that sensitive information could be traced and
   revealed by using counter tracing method. Therefore, this paper
   investigates tailored smart security algorithm, which is taking into
   account scenarios within smart cities. Consequently, users are able to
   be protected under tailored security modules based on circumstances of
   network, smart devices, and types of services.}},

Title = {{Wireless M-Bus Sensor Networks for Smart Water Grids: Analysis and
   Results}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Wireless sensor network technologies are experiencing an impressive
   development, as they represent one of the building blocks upon which new
   paradigms, such as Internet of Things and Smart Cities, may be
   implemented. Among the different applications enabled by such
   technologies, automatic monitoring of the water grid, and smart metering
   of water consumptions, may have a great impact on the preservation of
   one of the most valued, and increasingly scarce, natural resources.
   Sensor nodes located along water pipes cannot rely on the availability
   of power grid facilities to get the necessary energy imposed by their
   working conditions. In this sense, an energy-efficient design of the
   network architecture, and the evaluation of Energy Harvesting techniques
   to sustain its nodes, becomes of paramount importance. This paper
   investigates the suitability of a Wireless Metering Bus-based solution
   for the implementation of smart water grids, by evaluating network and
   node related performance, through simulations, prototype design, and
   experimental tests, which confirm the feasibility and efficiency of the
   proposal.}},

Title = {{Estimating Energy Savings in Smart Street Lighting by Using an Adaptive
   Control System}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The driving force behind the smart city initiative is to offer better,
   more specialized services which can improve the quality of life of the
   citizens while promoting sustainability. To achieve both of these
   apparently competing goals, services must be increasingly autonomous and
   continuously adaptive to changes in their environment and the
   information coming from other services. In this paper we focus on smart
   lighting, a relevant application domain for which we propose an
   intelligent street light control system based on adaptive behavior
   rules. We evaluate our approach by using a simulator which combines
   wireless sensor networks and belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents to
   enable a precise simulation of both the city infrastructure and the
   adaptive behavior that it implements. The results reveal energy savings
   of close to 35\% when the lighting system implements an adaptive
   behavior as opposed to a rigid, predefined behavior.}},

Title = {{Semantic Reasoning with Contextual Ontologies on Sensor Cloud
   Environment}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{This research first focused on processing enormous number of sensor
   events from a variety of city-wide sensor networks. As a solution, the
   well-known big data handling scheme, Hadoop cluster framework, drew,
   unquestionably, our attention. The acquired sensor events are to be used
   to immediately detect a certain abnormal situation within the framework.
   Accordingly, we integrated our existing context-aware collaboration
   framework with Hadoop cluster framework by interfacing data collection
   and context-aware reasoning parts of the existing framework with the
   Hadoop cluster framework. This approach enabled us to effectively
   process massive sensor events and semantically analyze the big data
   within the cluster environment. The proposed smart city sensor cloud
   framework provides ontology-enabled semantic reasoning scheme with the
   XOntology in combination with the Context-Aware Inference (CAI) model.
   By applying the ontology technology, the proposed framework enhances the
   availability and interoperability of the contextual information across
   many cooperating parties according to semantic reasoning results.
   Further, this framework is flexible enough to integrate any
   heterogeneous platforms including many existing IT solutions as well as
   mobile platforms. In addition, this approach presents the direction of
   progressive migration of many existing sensor network solutions into big
   data handling sensor cloud framework.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WEB AND GRID SERVICES}},

Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{114-138}},
Abstract = {{Smart cities offer a challenging way to design future networks,
   optimising services, costs and management activities. This requires ICT
   technologies able to interact with the environment. In particular,
   sensing activities become essential to support new and advanced services
   for the public good. The drawback is the explosion of the amount of
   heterogeneous information that has to be stored and processed. Thus,
   specific solutions for big data management become crucial. In this
   paper, we present a new architecture, called IoT4S, for the fine-grained
   storage of environmental information collected through several
   heterogeneous sensing devices. It provides a high abstraction layer for
   the description of both sensing infrastructures and sensed data, which
   can be exported as `things' to the internet. Also, we propose a new
   two-layer system for data storage to support IoT4S in the data
   dissemination service, which is a hybrid solution based on both SQL-like
   and NoSQL technologies. The paper provides an in-depth description of
   the IoT4S design, implementation details and a preliminary analysis of
   its behaviour in real and emulated scenarios.}},

Title = {{Energy Efficient and Load Balanced Routing for Wireless Multihop Network
   Applications}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can benefit from ad hoc networking
   technology characterized by multihop wireless connectivity and
   infrastructure less framework. These features make them suitable for
   next-generation networks to support several applications such M2M
   applications for smart cities and public safety scenarios. Pivotal
   design requirements for these scenarios are energy efficiency, since
   many of these devices will be battery powered placing a fundamental
   limit on network, and specifically node lifetime. Moreover, the way in
   which traffic is managed also influences network lifetime, since there
   is a high probability for some nodes to become overloaded by packet
   forwarding operations in order to support neighbour data exchange. These
   issues imply the need for energy efficient and load balanced routing
   approaches that can manage the network load and not only provide reduced
   energy consumption on the network but also prolong the network lifetime
   providing robust and continuous. This work proposes a new energy
   efficient and traffic balancing routing approach that can provide a
   weighted and flexible trade-off between energy consumption and load
   dispersion. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol achieves
   high energy efficiency, decreases the percentage of failed nodes due to
   lack of battery power, and extends the lifespan of the network.}},

Title = {{Programming environments: environmentality and citizen sensing in the

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY \& SPACE}},

Abstract = {{A new wave of smart-city projects is underway that proposes to deploy
   sensor-based ubiquitous computing across urban infrastructures and
   mobile devices to achieve greater sustainability. But in what ways do
   these smart and sustainable cities give rise to distinct
   material-political arrangements and practices that potentially delimit
   urban `citizenship' to a series of actions focused on monitoring and
   managing data? And what are the implications of computationally
   organized distributions of environmental governance that are programmed
   for distinct functionalities and are managed by corporate and state
   actors that engage with cities as datasets to be manipulated? In this
   paper I discuss the ways in which smart-city proposals might be
   understood through processes of environmentality or the distribution of
   governance within and through environments and environmental
   technologies. I do this by working through an early and formative
   smart-city design proposal, the Connected Sustainable Cities (CSC)
   project, developed by MIT and Cisco within the Connected Urban
   Development initiative between 2007 and 2008. Revisiting and reworking
   Foucault's notion of environmentality in the context of the CSC
   smart-city design proposal, I advance an approach to environmentality
   that deals not with the production of environmental subjects, but rather
   with the specific spatial-material distribution and relationality of
   power through environments, technologies, and ways of life. By updating
   and advancing environmentality through a discussion of computational
   urbanisms, I consider how practices and operations of citizenship emerge
   that are a critical part of the imaginings of smart and sustainable
   cities. This reversioning of environmentality through the smart city
   recasts who or what counts as a `citizen' and attends to the ways in
   which citizenship is articulated environmentally through the
   distribution and feedback of monitoring and urban data practices, rather
   than through governable subjects or populations.}},

Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Mobility management is a desired feature for the emerging Internet of
   Things (IoT). Mobility aware solutions increase the connectivity and
   enhance adaptability to changes of the location and infrastructure. IoT
   is enabling a new generation of dynamic ecosystems in environments such
   as smart cities and hospitals. Dynamic ecosystems require ubiquitous
   access to Internet, seamless handover, flexible roaming policies, and an
   interoperable mobility protocol with existing Internet infrastructure.
   These features are challenges for IoT devices, which are usually
   constrained devices with low memory, processing, communication and
   energy capabilities. This work presents an analysis of the requirements
   and desirable features for the mobility support in the IoT, and proposes
   an efficient solution for constrained environments based on Mobile IPv6
   and IPSec. Compatibility with IPv6-existing protocols has been
   considered a major requirement in order to offer scalable and
   inter-domain solutions that were not limited to specific application
   domains in order to enable a new generation of application and services
   over Internet-enabled dynamic ecosystems, and security support based on
   IPSec has been also considered, since dynamic ecosystems present several
   challenges in terms of security and privacy. This work has, on the one
   hand, analysed suitability of Mobile IPv6 and IPSec for constrained
   devices, and on the other hand, analysed, designed, developed and
   evaluated a lightweight version of Mobile IPv6 and IPSec. The proposed
   solution of lightweight Mobile IPv6 with IPSec is aware of the
   requirements of the IoT and presents the best solution for dynamic
   ecosystems in terms of efficiency and security adapted to IoT-devices
   capabilities. This presents concerns in terms of higher overhead and
   memory requirements. But, it is proofed and concluded that even when
   higher memory is required and major overhead is presented, the
   integration of Mobile IPv6 and IPSec for constrained devices is
   feasible.}},

Abstract = {{One of the missions of smart cities is to contribute to the environment
   and reduce social costs by using energy more efficiently and utilizing
   more renewable and distributed energy. This is reflected in the
   increasing use of renewable energy and in energy consumers becoming
   ``prosumers,{''} i.e., people who not only consume but also generate and
   sell power. However, several factors related to this trend are causing
   both the supply and demand sides of electrical power to fluctuate and
   complicate the control of the balance between the two sides. While
   supply and demand balance is controlled mainly with generators in
   conventional power systems, more effective and economical control is
   needed for future systems. We believe that it will be important to also
   optimally control the amount of energy that is needed for people to
   manage their daily lives at home and at work. Demand response (DR) is a
   technology that is receiving attention in light of this need. This
   article introduces R\&D initiatives at Fujitsu Laboratories, including
   development of a Demand Response Automation Server (DRAS) conforming to
   OpenADR, which is advancing as a standard for DR, and a building-demand
   simulation technology that optimizes control of the balance between
   supply and demand for electric power using DR technology.}},

Abstract = {{Machine-type communication emerges recently as a solution to cater for
   ubiquitous connections between a diversity of devices and the public
   wireless data networks. Long Term Evolution Advanced system introduces
   machinetomachine (M2M) communication as an important part of realising
   the blueprint of smart cities. To bring M2M communication into reality,
   the access procedure is a key problem. Massive access requests on the
   air interface in M2M communication make the communication scenarios
   significantly different from the traditional communications, which
   challenges the cellular access mechanism greatly. In this paper, the
   challenges of applying M2M through Long Term Evolution Advanced system
   are discussed. We model the access on the air interface as a queuing
   system. The queuing theory indicates that the system is not stable when
   the occupation rate is high. The access performance of M2M is evaluated
   by system level simulation, which shows that the congestion on the air
   interface is very serious in some application cases. To ease the
   congestion on the air interface, this paper proposes a bundling
   transmission scheme. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Meeting citizens' requirements economically and efficiently is the most
   important objective of Smart Cities. As a matter of fact, they are
   considered a key concept both for future Internet and information and
   communications technology. It is expected that a wide range of services
   will be made available for residential users (e.g. intelligent
   transportation systems, e-government, e-banking, e-commerce and smart
   management of energy demand), public administration entities, public
   safety and civil protection agencies and so on with increased quality,
   lower costs and reduced environmental impact. In order to achieve these
   ambitious objectives, new technologies should be developed such as
   non-invasive sensing, highly parallel processing, smart grids and mobile
   broadband communications. This paper considers the communication aspects
   of Smart City applications, specifically, the role of the latest
   developments of Long-Term Evolution-Advanced standard, which forecast
   the increase of broadband coverage by means of small cells. We shall
   demonstrate that the novel concept of small cell fully meets the
   emerging communication and networking requirements of future Smart
   Cities. To this aim, a feasible network architecture for future Smart
   Cities, based on small cells, will be discussed in the framework of a
   future smarter and user-centric perspective of forthcoming 4G mobile

Abstract = {{The concept of smart city has emerged worldwide as a feasible answer to
   the challenges raised by the increasing urbanisation. From the
   technological point of view, guaranteeing ubiquitous connectivity,
   reliable communications and seamless integration of multiple network
   access technologies are mandatory in a smart city. This is in contrast
   with the current infrastructure deployment in several urban areas, which
   is characterised by lack of ubiquitous connectivity and coverage and by
   fragmentation of networks that are usually deployed by different
   operators and without any centralised control by the city authorities.
   In this paper, we look at the heterogeneity of devices and network
   technologies under a different perspective by not perceiving it as a
   limitation but as a potential to increase the connectivity in a smart
   city. We propose a new generation of network nodes, called stem nodes,
   based on the innovative idea of stemness', which pushes forward the
   well-known self-configuration and self-management concepts towards the
   idea of node mutation and evolution. We also deployed prototypes that
   demonstrate the stem-node architecture and basic operations in different
   hardware platforms of common communication devices (an Alix-based
   router, a laptop and a smartphone). Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Over six billion people are expected to live in cities and surrounding
   regions by 2050. Consequently, in the near future, the autonomic and
   smart operation of cities may be a critical requirement to improve the
   economic, social, and environmental well-being of citizens. Smart urban
   technologies represent an important contribution to the sustainable
   development of cities, making smart cities a reality. In this sense, the
   energy sustainability of cities has become a global concern, bringing
   with it a wide range of research and technological challenges that
   affect many aspects of people's lives. Because most of the human
   lifetime is spent indoors, buildings, which make up a city subsystem,
   require special attention. Indeed, buildings are the cornerstone in
   terms of power consumption and CO2 emissions on a global scale. In this
   paper, we analyze the role that buildings play in terms of their energy
   performance at city level and present an energy-efficient management
   system integrated in a building automation platform based on an Internet
   of Things approach. Occupants play a crucial role in the system's
   operation to achieve energy efficient building performance, and any
   impact on self-sustainable smart cities will be a consequence of
   efficient user-centric smart building designs. Our proposal represents a
   user-centric smart solution as a contribution to the energy
   sustainability of modern cities. The building management platform has
   been deployed in a real (smart) building, in which a set of tests were
   carried out to assess different concerns involved in the building's
   infrastructure management. The first stages of this experiment have
   already resulted in an energy saving in heating of about 20\% at
   building level, which could translate into a reduction of 8\% in the
   energy consumption of buildings at a European city level. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic energy harvesting is one of the most promising
   technologies for the future of autonomous electronic gadgets and also
   for making possible the globalisation of the Internet of things concept
   and consequently smart cities. In order to obtain an optimum
   dimensioning of the energy requirements in environments where a large
   quantity of sensors and devices are spread, it is necessary to have a
   priori knowledge of the amount of energy that is available from existing
   electromagnetic sources in the surrounding environment. This article
   presents a geo-referenced database that can be used to gather
   information about electromagnetic energy availability around the world.
   The paper describes the information system architecture that is behind
   the database structure and the two methods that can be used to gather
   the electromagnetic information: one based on typical radiofrequency
   instrumentation and the other one based on the use of smart phones.

Abstract = {{The world population is growing at a rapid pace. Towns and cities are
   accommodating half of the world's population thereby creating tremendous
   pressure on every aspect of urban living. Cities are known to have large
   concentration of resources and facilities. Such environments attract
   people from rural areas. However, unprecedented attraction has now
   become an overwhelming issue for city governance and politics. The
   enormous pressure towards efficient city management has triggered
   various Smart City initiatives by both government and private sector
   businesses to invest in information and communication technologies to
   find sustainable solutions to the growing issues. The Internet of Things
   (IoT) has also gained significant attention over the past decade. IoT
   envisions to connect billions of sensors to the Internet and expects to
   use them for efficient and effective resource management in Smart
   Cities. Today, infrastructure, platforms and software applications are
   offered as services using cloud technologies. In this paper, we explore
   the concept of sensing as a service and how it fits with the IoT. Our
   objective is to investigate the concept of sensing as a service model in
   technological, economical and social perspectives and identify the major
   open challenges and issues. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{From ancient Europe, the renaissance and industrialisation eras, to the
   modern times, urban planning paradigms have evolved in many ways,
   advancing the environments where people live in. Nevertheless, the

Abstract = {{Parking spot monitoring can be used for various smart parking
   applications. One particular use is detecting the city wide occupancy
   level of the parking spaces and redirecting cars accordingly to reduce
   congestion. The practice of monitoring parking spots is already
   widespread in modern off-street parking lots. However, a large fraction
   of a city's parking capacity still stems from on-street parking spots.
   These aren't yet monitored as commonly. This can be explained by higher
   deployment costs for on-street implementations.In light of improving the
   adoption of on-street parking spot monitoring, this paper evaluates a
   novel approach to reduce these deployment costs. The idea is to provide
   sensor readings on only a fraction of the parking spots and use
   extrapolation to calculate city wide saturation levels. This reduces the
   number of sensors that has to be installed and consequently lowers the
   network cost.A probabilistic model and corresponding performance measure
   were built to quantify the reliability of a sensor network that
   implements this approach. Dependent on the number of sensors deployed,
   the estimated saturation levels might be subject to extrapolation
   errors. An analysis of several deployments scenarios with decreasing
   numbers of sensors shows that significant cost reductions (up to a
   factor 30) are obtainable whilst retaining sufficient performance.These
   results exceed cost reductions obtained by alternative approaches where
   a switch is made from roadside to vehicle mounted sensors for monitoring
   parking spots. An additional comparative advantage of our approach is
   the reduced dependency on vehicles equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle or
   vehicle-to-environment communication units. Copyright (c) 2013 John

Title = {{TSRF: A Trust-Aware Secure Routing Framework in Wireless Sensor Networks}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, trust-aware routing protocol plays a vital role in
   security of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which is one of the most
   popular network technologies for smart city. However, several key issues
   in conventional trust-aware routing protocols still remain to be solved,
   such as the compatibility of trust metric with QoS metrics and the
   control of overhead produced by trust evaluation procedure. This paper
   proposes a trust-aware secure routing framework (TSRF) with the
   characteristics of lightweight and high ability to resist various
   attacks. To meet the security requirements of routing protocols in WSNs,
   we first analyze features of common attacks on trust-aware routing
   schemes. Then, specific trust computation and trust derivation schemes
   are proposed based on analysis results. Finally, our design uses the
   combination of trust metric and QoS metrics as routing metrics to
   present an optimized routing algorithm. We show with the help of
   simulations that TSRF can achieve both intended security and high
   efficiency suitable for WSN-based networks.}},

Title = {{eCOTS: Efficient and Cooperative Task Sharing for Large-Scale Smart City
   Sensing Application}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{With the pervasive use of mobile devices and increasingly computational
   ability, more concrete and deeper collaborations among mobile users are
   becoming possible and needed. However, most of the studies fail to
   consider load balancing requirement among mobile users. When tasks are
   unevenly distributed, the processing time as well as energy consumption
   will be extremely high on some devices, which will inevitably
   counterweight the benefits from incentive mechanism and task scheduling
   scheme. In this work, we propose eCOTS (Efficient and Cooperative Task
   Sharing for Large-scale Smart City Sensing Application). We leverage the
   ``balls and bins{''} theory for task assignment, where d mobile users in
   contact range are investigated, and select the least loaded one among
   the d users. It has been proved that such simple case can effectively
   reduce the largest queueing length from theta(log n/ log log n) to
   theta(log log n/ log d). Simulation and real-trace driven studies have
   shown that, eCOTS can effectively improve the balancing effects in
   typical network scenarios, even the energy level and computational
   capability are diverse. In simulation study, eCOTS can reduce the gap
   between the maximum and minimum queueing lengths up to 5x and over 2x in
   real trace data evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines changes from 2000 to 2010 in the adoption of
   sustainability plans and policies in a sample of U.S. cities. The
   study's framework posits sustainability initiatives as communitarian
   outcomes intended to meet the needs of both current and future
   generations. We hypothesize, accordingly, that a community's social
   capital level, in the form of the relative presence of social trust, is
   a primary facilitating condition for the adoption of sustainability
   initiatives. The analysis assesses whether trust-based social capital is
   similarly associated with the adoption of plans and policies at both
   time points (2000 and 2010), as well as whether social capital is
   associated with change in the adoption levels documented across the
   ten-year period. The paper concludes by suggesting that the effect of
   social capital is substantially reduced in 2010 as a consequence of
   institutional network dynamics featured in the theory of isomorphic
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Providers of potable water to households and businesses are charged with
   conserving water. Addressing this challenge requires accurate
   information about how water is actually being used. So smart meters are
   being deployed on a large scale by water providers to collect medium
   resolution water use data. This paper presents water use signature
   patterns, the first technique designed for medium resolution meters for
   discovering patterns that explain how households use water. Signature
   patterns are clusters (subsets) of water meter readings specified by
   patterns on volumes and calendar dates. Four types of signature pattern
   are introduced in this paper: continuous flow days; exceptional peak use
   days; programmed patterns with recurrent hours; and normal use
   partitioned by season and period of the day. Signature patterns for each
   household are calculated using efficient selection rules that scale for
   city populations and years of data collection. Data from a real-world,
   large-scale, smart metering trial are analyzed using water use signature
   patterns. The results demonstrate that water use behaviors are
   distinctive, for both individuals and populations. Signatures can
   identify behaviors that are promising targets for water conservation.
   Pattern discovery can be automated with an efficient and scalable
   computer program. By identifying relevant consumption patterns in medium
   resolution meter data, water use signature patterns can help to achieve
   the water conservation potential of large-scale smart metering.}},

Abstract = {{Designing a future smart city (FSC) that copes with the reduction of CO2
   has become one of the urgent tasks of the next 20 years. One promising
   approach to achieve FSC is to combine appropriate land use (compact city
   with energy efficient buildings and photovoltaic panels (PVs)),
   transportation (electric vehicles (EVs) and public transportation
   system) and energy systems (smart grid systems), because of the
   interaction between these elements. However, there are few models which
   simulate these elements in an integrated manner. This paper presents the
   concept of the integrated model, and shows the land use-energy part of
   the model created for the Tokyo metropolitan area, which is the largest
   Mega city in the world. Firstly, a spatially explicit land use model
   (urban economic model) is constructed for the study area, and the model
   is calibrated using existing statistical data. Secondly, possible future
   compact/dispersion city scenarios for the year 2050 are created using
   the model. Thirdly, intra-day dynamics (hourly) of electricity demand
   and supply from PVs, which is assumed to be installed to the roofs of
   all detached houses in the study area, under two urban scenarios is
   simulated. The obtained results suggest that {[}1] ``compact{''} urban
   form may contribute to the reduction of electricity demand from the
   residential sector, but {[}2] PV-supply under the scenario may also be
   reduced because of the decreased share of detached houses. Hence in the
   compact city scenario, it is important to discuss the effective use of
   vacant areas in suburbs, which may be used for large PV installations,
   or be re-vegetated to mitigate urban heat island effects. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The possibility of so-called `smart' technologies to improve city life

   officials and decision-makers are ill-equipped to judge both the value
   and the externalities of the technologies being sold under the label
   `smart cities'. This paper presents a summary of smart solutions and
   definitions, and draws on the surveillance literature to address issues
   and risks related to the global drive to outsmart competing cities in a
   context of global governance. Using a multi-faceted and

   distinctive properties of vehicular network environments. New routing
   strategies must complement the existing protocols to improve their
   performance in vehicular scenarios. This paper introduces a novel
   intelligent routing technique that makes decisions in order to
   adaptively adjust its operation and obtain a global benefit. The nodes
   sense the network locally and collect information to feed the cognitive
   module which will select the best routing strategy, without the need of
   additional protocol message dissemination or convergence mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Electricity power grid operations require information about demand and
   supply on a variety of time-scales and areas. The advent of significant
   generation contributions by time variable renewable energy sources means
   that forecasting methods are increasingly required. Some of the earliest
   requirements will be for spatial-temporal estimation of solar irradiance
   and the resulting photovoltaic-generated electricity. Accurate forecasts
   represent an important step towards building a smart grid for renewable
   energy driven cities or regions, and to this end we develop forecasting
   tools that use data from ground-based irradiance sensors.
   Spatial-temporal datasets that enjoy the properties of stationarity,
   full symmetry and separability are in general more amenable to
   forecasting using time-forward kriging algorithms. Usually, none of
   these properties obtain in meteorological data such as wind velocity
   fields and solar irradiance distributions. In this paper, we construct a
   statistical forecast system to mitigate this problem. We first achieve
   temporal stationarity by detrending solar irradiance time series at
   individual monitoring stations. We then approximate spatial stationarity
   through deformations of the geographic coordinates. Various
   spatial-temporal variance-covariance structures are formed to explore
   full symmetry and separability. Finally, time-forward kriging is used to
   forecast the hourly spatial-temporal solar irradiance data from 10
   Singapore weather stations. The aim of the proposed system is to
   forecast irradiance and PV electricity generation at arbitrary spatial
   locations within a monitored area. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Vehicles equipped with GPS localizers are an important sensory device
   for examining people's movements and activities. Taxis equipped with GPS
   localizers serve the transportation needs of a large number of people
   driven by diverse needs; their traces can tell us where passengers were
   picked up and dropped off, which route was taken, and what steps the
   driver took to find a new passenger. In this article, we provide an
   exhaustive survey of the work on mining these traces. We first provide a
   formalization of the data sets, along with an overview of different
   mechanisms for preprocessing the data. We then classify the existing
   work into three main categories: social dynamics, traffic dynamics and
   operational dynamics. Social dynamics refers to the study of the
   collective behaviour of a city's population, based on their observed
   movements; Traffic dynamics studies the resulting flow of the movement
   through the road network; Operational dynamics refers to the study and
   analysis of taxi driver's modus operandi. We discuss the different
   problems currently being researched, the various approaches proposed,
   and suggest new avenues of research. Finally, we present a historical
   overview of the research work in this field and discuss which areas hold
   most promise for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Improving efficiency of city services and facilitating a more
   sustainable development of cities are the main drivers of the smart city
   concept. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) play a crucial
   role in making cities smarter, more accessible and more open. In this
   paper we present a novel architecture exploiting major concepts from the
   Future Internet (FI) paradigm addressing the challenges that need to be
   overcome when creating smarter cities. This architecture takes advantage
   of both the critical communications infrastructures already in place and
   owned by the utilities as well as of the infrastructure belonging to the
   city municipalities to accelerate efficient provision of existing and
   new city services. The paper highlights how FI technologies create the
   necessary glue and logic that allows the integration of current vertical
   and isolated city services into a holistic solution, which enables a
   huge forward leap for the efficiency and sustainability of our cities.
   Moreover, the paper describes a real-world prototype, that instantiates
   the aforementioned architecture, deployed in one of the parks of the
   city of Santander providing an autonomous public street lighting
   adaptation service. This prototype is a showcase on how added-value
   services can be seamlessly created on top of the proposed architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) networks are the pillar of recent novel
   scenarios, such as smart cities or e-healthcare applications. Among
   other challenges, these networks cover the deployment and interaction of
   small devices with constrained capabilities and Internet protocol
   (IP)-based networking connectivity. These constrained devices usually
   require connection to the Internet to exchange information (e. g.,
   management or sensing data) or access network services. However, only
   authenticated and authorized devices can, in general, establish this
   connection. The so-called authentication, authorization and accounting
   (AAA) services are in charge of performing these tasks on the Internet.
   Thus, it is necessary to deploy protocols that allow constrained devices
   to verify their credentials against AAA infrastructures. The Protocol
   for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) has been
   standardized by the Internet engineering task force (IETF) to carry the
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), which provides flexible
   authentication upon the presence of AAA. To the best of our knowledge,
   this paper is the first deep study of the feasibility of EAP/PANA for
   network access control in constrained devices. We provide light-weight
   versions and implementations of these protocols to fit them into
   constrained devices. These versions have been designed to reduce the
   impact in standard specifications. The goal of this work is two-fold:
   (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of EAP/PANA in IoT devices; (2) to
   provide the scientific community with the first light-weight
   interoperable implementation of EAP/PANA for constrained devices in the
   Contiki operating system (Contiki OS), called PANATIKI. The paper also
   shows a testbed, simulations and experimental results obtained from real
   and simulated constrained devices.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamically detecting anomalies can be difficult in very large-scale
   infrastructure networks. The authors' approach addresses spatiotemporal
   anomaly detection in a smarter city context with large numbers of
   sensors deployed. They propose a scalable, hybrid Internet
   infrastructure for dynamically detecting potential anomalies in real
   time using stream processing. The infrastructure enables analytically
   inspecting and comparing anomalies globally using large-scale array
   processing. Deployed on a real pipe network topology of 1,891 nodes,
   this approach can effectively detect and characterize anomalies while
   minimizing the amount of data shared across the network.}},

Abstract = {{Informational Cities are the prototypical spaces of the knowledge
   society. Public libraries play an important role as parts of the
   digital, smart, knowledge and creative infrastructures of these
   Informational Cities. Libraries have economic value as location factors
   in the two spaces of Informational Cities, the physical and the digital.
   For this reason, we divided the library services into two main groups,
   namely the digital library and the physical library. For 31 specified
   Informational World Cities, we empirically analyzed the core services of
   their public libraries via content analysis of the libraries' Web pages.
   Additionally, we studied these libraries' social media activities. Many
   libraries provide free e-resources (above all, e-books, e-journals and
   bibliographical databases) to their customers. Libraries offer digital
   reference services, mainly via e-mail and Web forms. Their presence in
   social media is dominated by posts on Facebook and Twitter. Nearly all
   public libraries we analyzed represent attractive architectural
   landmarks in their region. Besides offering spaces for children, the
   libraries provide rooms for learning and getting together and, to a
   lesser degree, modular working spaces. Most libraries provide Wi-Fi
   inside their buildings; more than half of those we investigated work
   with RFID technology. The prototypical public library in the knowledge
   society has two core services: (1) to support citizens, companies and
   administrations in their city and region with digital services, namely
   e-resources as well as reference services, and to communicate with their
   customers via social media; and (2) to provide physical spaces for
   meeting, learning and working, as well as areas for children and other
   groups, in a building that is a landmark of the city.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new discrete choice model aimed at describing
   behaviour of public transport passengers at stops. We assume that
   passengers choose a set of buses from which they take the first
   arriving. This leads to a nested model formulation in which the upper
   level (choice set formation) is based on utility maximisation. The lower
   level choice of a specific bus from the choice set is given by the
   frequency distribution of the bus arrivals. We further consider
   hyperpath characteristics in the choice set formulation which means that
   the utility of the choice set in general increases with the addition of
   further options due to a reduction in the reduced waiting time. We
   discuss model properties and apply our model to some selected OD pairs
   of the bus network of a local city in Japan where we could observe
   passenger behaviour due to the availability of smart card data. We find
   that choice sets vary fairly significantly between some passenger groups
   and discuss implications for transit assignment models. (C) 2013

   developments were not generally dispersed in suburban areas either.
   Instead, commercial developers tended to locate them in locations within

Abstract = {{The LEED rating system for neighborhood development (LEED-ND) was
   developed in an effort to extend the certification of sustainability
   beyond green buildings. It has been most often used to certify a LEED-ND
   ``project{''} in the same way that LEED certifies individual buildings.
   However, to date very few projects have been LEED-ND certified due to
   the significant costs in money, time and expertise involved in
   certifying individual projects. This paper argues that identifying
   LEED-ND eligible locations is more efficient at the scale of
   jurisdictions rather than individual projects. By identifying
   LEED-ND-ready parcels cities can incentivize more sustainable
   development in these locations and make it much more affordable for
   developers to utilize LEED-ND.
   The paper presents a methodology that identifies which parcels are
   compliant with the most important criterion in the LEED-ND rating
   system: the ``Smart Location and Linkage{''} or SLL prerequisite.
   Applying the method to the City of Phoenix, just over 9000 acres in the
   city are found to be LEED-ND eligible lands, without constraints. This
   represents 26\% of the candidate acreage (all vacant or redevelopable
   land), a somewhat higher percentage than expected. The paper further
   finds that LEED-ND eligible parcels in Phoenix are not approximated well
   by Walk Scores and that they tend to be located in areas with lower
   densities and lower market strength, as well as in areas with a higher
   proportion of renter-occupied units, including subsidized housing. (C)

Abstract = {{Recent advances in the fields of wireless technology have exhibited a
   strong potential and tendency on improving human life by means of
   ubiquitous communications devices that enable smart, distributed
   services. In fact, traditional human to human (H2H) communications are
   gradually falling behind the scale of necessity. Consequently, machine
   to machine (M2M) communications have surpassed H2H, thus drawing
   significant interest from industry and the research community recently.
   This paper first presents a four-layer architecture for internet of
   things (IoT). Based on this architecture, we employ the second
   generation RFID technology to propose a novel intelligent system for M2M
   communications.}},

Abstract = {{The archetypal metabolism of the city is defined by the flows of energy
   and materials (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, water) entering the city
   from the rest of the global economy, then circulating around and through
   its economic, social and industrial life, before returning to the city's
   environment (and the global economy). Salient in realising a smarter
   urban metabolism is the change in viewing nutrients not as pollutants -
   a perception entailed in the historic success of water-based systems for
   securing public health in cities - but as resources to be gainfully
   recovered. In order to explore the scope and feasibility of such
   (radical) change, a computational multi-sectoral systems analysis
   procedure has been developed and applied to case studies of Atlanta,
   USA, and London, UK. Starting with an expression of what might
   constitute a more benign, climate-repairing future for the interaction
   between these cities and their environments, multi-sectoral systems
   analysis is used to examine aspects of the economic feasibility and then
   social legitimacy of candidate policy interventions and technological
   innovations for attaining such a future. In particular, the notion of a
   privileged, non-foreclosing innovation or intervention is introduced and
   illustrated.}},

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{260-266}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This study presents the results of a collision-based full Bayes (FB)
   before after (BA) safety evaluation of a newly proposed design for
   channelized right-turn lanes. The design which is termed ``Smart
   Channels{''} decreases the angle of the channelized right-turn to
   approximately 70 degrees. Its implementation is usually advocated to
   afford drivers a better view of the traffic stream they are to merge
   with and to allow also for safer pedestrian crossing. The evaluation
   used data for three treatment intersections and several comparison sites
   in the city of Penticton, British Columbia. The evaluation utilized FB
   univariate and multivariate linear intervention models with multiple
   regression links representing time, treatment, and interaction effects
   as well as the traffic volumes effects. As well, the models were
   extended to incorporate random parameters to account for the correlation
   between sites within comparison-treatment pairs. The results showed that
   the implementation of the right-turn treatment has resulted in a
   considerable reduction in the severity and frequency of collisions.
   Another objective of the paper was to compare the results of the
   collision-based evaluation with the results of a traffic conflict-based
   evaluation of the same treatment intersections. The comparison showed
   remarkable similarity between the overall and the location specific
   reductions in conflicts and collisions which provides support for using
   traffic conflicts in BA studies. The results also provide positive
   empirical evidence that can support the validity of traffic conflict
   techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In recent decades, the four-county Seattle city-region has built one of
   the few `containment' regimes in the United States. Metropolitan
   development policy is organized around growth management and transport
   principles that seek to ameliorate the ecological, economic, and social
   effects of both suburban sprawl and economic segregation. In addition to
   regionally-coordinated urban growth boundaries, which implode new growth
   back to already serviced lands, planning for regional sustainability
   therefore also includes strategic efforts to improve extant jobs-housing
   imbalances through major transit investments in key urban centers. This
   paper considers Greater Seattle's recent policy experiences with
   planning transit communities from the perspectives of the regional labor
   market and state policies organized around sustainability. The paper
   explores the critical concern that while agglomeration economies
   continue to produce a variety of employment centers across metropolitan
   space, relatively scarce public transit investments might be directed
   invariably to edifying economic centers populated by social elites who
   already enjoy multiple mobility choices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Quality of life differences across areas can be measured by differences
   in ``real wages,{''} where real wages are computed as nominal wages
   adjusted for the cost of living. Computing cost of living differences
   involves several important issues, including how housing prices should
   be measured. Previous researchers typically have used some combination
   of rental payments and homeowner housing values, but housing values are
   forward-looking and may not reflect current user costs. This paper
   examines differences in quality of life estimates for US metropolitan
   areas using, alternatively, rents and housing values. We find that the
   two measures of quality of life are highly correlated. Value-based
   estimates, however, are considerably more dispersed than rent-based
   estimates, likely because of the recent housing bubble and because
   housing values often provide an imperfect measure of the present user
   cost of housing.}},

Journal = {{IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous smart environments, equipped with low-cost and
   easy-deployable wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and widespread mobile ad
   hoc networks (MANETs), are opening brand new opportunities in wide-scale
   urban monitoring. Indeed, MANET and WSN convergence paves the way for
   the development of brand new Internet of Things (IoT) communication
   platforms with a high potential for a wide range of applications in
   different domains. Urban data collection, i.e., the harvesting of
   monitoring data sensed by a large number of collaborating sensors, is a
   challenging task because of many open technical issues, from typical WSN
   limitations (bandwidth, energy, delivery time, etc.) to the lack of
   widespread WSN data collection standards, needed for practical
   deployment in existing and upcoming IoT scenarios. In particular,
   effective collection is crucial for classes of smart city services that
   require a timely delivery of urgent data such as environmental
   monitoring, homeland security, and city surveillance. After surveying
   the existing WSN interoperability efforts for urban sensing, this paper
   proposes an original solution to integrate and opportunistically exploit
   MANET overlays, impromptu, and collaboratively formed over WSNs, to
   boost urban data harvesting in IoT. Overlays are used to dynamically
   differentiate and fasten the delivery of urgent sensed data over
   low-latency MANET paths by integrating with latest emergent
   standards/specifications for WSN data collection. The reported
   experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness (e. g.,
   limited coordination overhead) of the proposed solution.}},

Title = {{Intelligent Metering for Urban Water: A Review}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1052-1081}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper reviews the drivers, development and global deployment of
   intelligent water metering in the urban context. Recognising that
   intelligent metering (or smart metering) has the potential to
   revolutionise customer engagement and management of urban water by
   utilities, this paper provides a summary of the knowledge-base for
   researchers and industry practitioners to ensure that the technology
   fosters sustainable urban water management. To date, roll-outs of
   intelligent metering have been driven by the desire for increased data
   regarding time of use and end-use (such as use by shower, toilet,
   garden, etc.) as well as by the ability of the technology to reduce
   labour costs for meter reading. Technology development in the water
   sector generally lags that seen in the electricity sector. In the coming
   decade, the deployment of intelligent water metering will transition
   from being predominantly ``pilot or demonstration scale{''} with the
   occasional city-wide roll-out, to broader mainstream implementation.
   This means that issues which have hitherto received little focus must
   now be addressed, namely: the role of real-time data in customer
   engagement and demand management; data ownership, sharing and privacy;
   technical data management and infrastructure security, utility workforce
   skills; and costs and benefits of implementation.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of
   hospital-associated (HA) and community-associated (CA) Escherichia coli
   and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from patients with intra-abdominal
   infections (IAIs) in China. From 2002 to 2011, the minimum inhibitory
   concentrations (MICs) of 12 antibiotics against 3074 E. coli and 1025 K.
   pneumoniae from 23 centres located in 16 cities were determined by the
   broth microdilution method. During the 10 year study period, ertapenem,
   imipenem, amikacin and piperacillin-tazobactam retained high and stable
   activity against E. coli and K pneumoniae isolates regardless of whether
   their source was HA or CA and regardless of their extended-spectrum
   beta-lactamase (ESBL) production. However, the susceptibility of E coli
   to cephalosporins and ampicillin-sulbactam decreased dramatically during
   the 10 years, especially for the CA isolates. Fluoroquinolones showed
   low activity against E. coli. During the whole study period, the ESBL
   rates for E. coli isolates from IAIs increased from 36.1\% in 2002-2003
   to 68.1\% in 2010-2011 (P<0.001). Correspondingly, the ESBL rates in HA
   isolates increased from 52.2\% in 2002-2003 to 70.0\% in 2010-2011
   (P=0.001), and in CA isolates from 19.1\% in 2002-2003 to 61.6\% in
   2010-2011 (P<0.001). The ESBL-positive rate in K. pneumoniae remained
   between 30.1 and 39.3\% of the total isolates with no significant change
   during the 10 years. In conclusion, carbapenems retained the highest
   susceptibility rates against HA and CA E. coli and K. pneumoniae. High
   prevalence of ESBL in HA E. coli and fast-growing resistance in CA E.
   coli severely limit the empirical use of the third- and
   fourth-generation cephalosporins in the therapy of IAIs.}},

Abstract = {{The Glendale, Arizona Police Department received funding in 2009 through
   the Bureau of Justice Assistance's Smart Policing Initiative (SPI). The
   Glendale team employed problem-oriented policing to address crime and
   disorder at convenience stores throughout the city. The SPI team's
   analysis demonstrated that crime was disproportionately occurring at
   Circle K stores and that store management practices were largely
   responsible for the crime problem. The Glendale SPI team developed a
   multipronged response that included intervention with Circle K
   leadership and the implementation of prevention and suppression
   strategies. Results indicate that crime dropped significantly at the SPI
   target stores (42\%) from the year preceding the intervention to the
   year after. This decline is inconsistent with crime patterns witnessed
   at the remaining convenience stores in the city of Glendale. The article
   concludes with a discussion of how police departments can successfully
   engage with private sector corporations on issues of crime, disorder,
   and community safety.}},

   attention to the sustainable energy performances of green buildings to
   identify the influential parameters based upon the contemporary
   successful accomplishments. The study elaborates on the contemporary
   trends and applications of green building design and the respective
   impacts on sustainable developments. As a result, the analytical review
   confirms that the sustainable energy performance of green buildings has
   been transformed to a sensible and practical resolution to alleviate the
   CO2 emissions and diminish the building sector energy consumption. In
   addition, with view to the current challenges and barriers, the study
   concludes that; it is still crucial to identify and develop efficient
   energy solutions associated with green buildings for addressing the
   future energy demands. Likewise, the findings highlight that the
   sustainable energy performances associated with integrated technologies
   and renewable energy systems are still intertwined with significant
   challenges related to the fundamental parameters of cost, maintenance,
   and operation. In conclusion, the contemplations of the research

Abstract = {{Small reactors can apply to local power demands or remote areas. SMART,
   which can produce 90 MWe of electricity and 40,000 tons/day of sea-water
   desalination for a 100,000 population city, is a promising advanced
   integral type small reactor. The thermal hydraulic analysis code with a
   drift flux model, TASS/SMR, was developed for a conservative simulation
   of a small break loss of coolant accident in SMART. Taking into account
   SMART-specific inherent characteristics, the code adopts the
   Chexal-Lellouche correlation for a drift flux model. The capability of
   TASS/SMR code is validated using the results of the experimental data.
   The code predicts conservatively the void distribution compared with the
   experimental data. TASS/SMR calculation predicts reasonably major
   phenomena for the SBLOCA and is more conservative than or nearly the
   same as the results of the best estimated realistic system code, MARS.
   TASS/SMR code can be used for a SBLOCA analysis of SMART. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Efficient spatial index is essential for querying spatial sensor nodes
   in the context of smart city. Sensor nodes are usually unevenly
   distributed in real situations. In this setting, R-tree and its variants
   may cause large overlap and coverage among branch nodes, which impact
   the query efficiency greatly. To address this challenge, this paper
   proposes a novel skewness-aware clustering tree (SWC-tree) by clustering
   sensor nodes. Sensor nodes in a dense region will be put into the same
   node. Thus, overlap and coverage among node regions are less than that
   of R-tree and its variants. As dense regions contain more sensor nodes,
   we assign a higher priority to these region nodes for facilitating the
   query operation. Experimental results show that in the context of skewed
   distribution, SWC-tree is efficient in performance for conducting
   insertion, deletion, and query operations of sensor nodes. Copyright (c)

Title = {{Smart metering: enabler for rapid and effective post meter leakage
   identification and water loss management}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{Periods of urban water scarcity in cities places pressure on government
   agencies and water utilities to improve water distribution system
   efficiency through reducing the amount of water lost in the network as
   well as deploying a range of demand management techniques to conserve
   existing supply. Current estimations assume customer post meter leakage
   accounts for up to 10\% of total water consumption, particularly in the
   residential sector. Households identified as having post meter leakage
   using a citywide installation of smart metering technology were
   subjected to a mix of basic and tailored information regarding water
   loss. The primary aim of the study was to test the effectiveness of
   communication interventions and the attributed water savings resulting
   from the repair of household leaks. The residential leakage
   communication strategy resulted in a reduction in minimum night flows by
   a very significant 89\% over the duration of the study, while the
   control group receiving no communication increased consumption by 52\%.
   Moreover, questionnaire surveys were conducted to establish the
   significant factors, including leak type, demographics and household
   awareness, to name a few, that will influence the development of a
   fit-for-purpose post-meter leak rectification policy and program. The
   paper concludes with some key recommendations for future work to develop
   a predictive model for identifying, classifying and quantifying post
   meter loss as well as presents least cost planning implications of a
   leak rectification policy. The study confirmed that smart metering
   provides water utilities with a powerful tool to rapidly identify and
   action the significant volumes of post meter leakage occurring in our
   cities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding of the mechanisms driving our daily face-to-face
   encounters is still limited; the field lacks large-scale datasets
   describing both individual behaviors and their collective interactions.
   However, here, with the help of travel smart card data, we uncover such
   encounter mechanisms and structures by constructing a time-resolved
   in-vehicle social encounter network on public buses in a city (about 5
   million residents). Using a population scale dataset, we find physical
   encounters display reproducible temporal patterns, indicating that
   repeated encounters are regular and identical. On an individual scale,
   we find that collective regularities dominate distinct encounters'
   bounded nature. An individual's encounter capability is rooted in
   his/her daily behavioral regularity, explaining the emergence of
   ``familiar strangers{''} in daily life. Strikingly, we find individuals
   with repeated encounters are not grouped into small communities, but
   become strongly connected over time, resulting in a large, but
   imperceptible, small-world contact network or ``structure of
   co-presence{''} across the whole metropolitan area. Revealing the
   encounter pattern and identifying this large-scale contact network are
   crucial to understanding the dynamics in patterns of social
   acquaintances, collective human behaviors, and-particularly-disclosing
   the impact of human behavior on various diffusion/spreading processes.}},

Journal = {{HEALTH PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{177-186}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper reviews radiofrequency (RF) field levels produced by electric
   utility meters equipped with RF transceivers (so-called Smart Meters),
   focusing on meters from one manufacturer (Trilliant, Redwood City, CA,
   USA, and Granby, QC, Canada). The RF transmission levels are summarized
   based on publicly available data submitted to the U. S. Federal
   Communications Commission supplemented by limited independent
   measurements. As with other Smart Meters, this meter incorporates a low
   powered radiofrequency transceiver used for a neighborhood mesh network,
   in the present case using ZigBee-compliant physical and medium access
   layers, operating in the 2.45 GHz unlicensed band but with a proprietary
   network architecture. Simple calculations based on a free space
   propagation model indicate that peak RF field intensities are in the
   range of 10 mW m(-2) or less at a distance of more than 1-2 m from the
   meters. However, the duty cycle of transmission from the meters is very
   low (<1\%). Limited measurements identified pulses from the meter that
   were consistent with data reported by the vendor to the U. S. Federal
   Communications Commission. Limited measurements conducted in two houses
   with the meters were unable to clearly distinguish emissions from the
   meters from the considerable electromagnetic clutter in the same
   frequency range from other sources, including Wi-Fi routers and, when it
   was activated, a microwave oven. These preliminary measurements
   disclosed the difficulties that would be encountered in characterizing
   the RF exposures from these meters in homes in the face of background
   signals from other household devices in the same frequency range. An
   appendix provides an introduction to Smart Meter technology. The RF
   transmitters in wireless-equipped Smart Meters operate at similar power
   levels and in similar frequency ranges as many other digital
   communications devices in common use, and their exposure levels are very
   far below U. S. and international exposure limits.}},

Abstract = {{During the post-war era in the United States, the low-density suburban
   sprawl model has been the dominant paradigm of urban growth. In
   recognition of the significant economic, social and environmental costs
   of sprawl, a new smart growth paradigm of higher-density, mixed-use and
   transit-oriented urban centres has emerged in many metropolitan areas. A
   case study of Denver, Colorado, shows that the smart growth approach has
   been more effective than previous initiatives to change the development
   pattern and address the costs of sprawl. With many new urbanist projects
   and an aggressive transit-oriented development programme, Denver is
   offering a different urban alternative to its sprawling past. A broader
   coalition of support, especially including the development community,
   has characterised smart growth efforts in contrast to previous growth
   control initiatives. New forms of regional collaboration have
   contributed to a stronger regional identity, less jurisdictional
   infighting and greater consensus on issues of regional importance.}},

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{11, SI}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The paper draws on recent theorising on policy mobility and
   post-politics to investigate the planning of a New Urbanist settlement,
   Tornagrain, near Inverness in the Scottish Highlands, and designed by
   Andres Duany. It details Duany's role as an influential persuasive guru'
   of New Urbanism and his signatory charrette as a participatory method
   for engaging local citizens into the New Urbanist model of place-making.
   Nonetheless, the Tornagrain case raises non-trivial questions about this
   model, not least the faith being placed in a globally mobile policy
   evangelist becoming, in effect, a doctrinal conduit for convening local
   democracy. The paper then contributes to recent debate on post-political

Abstract = {{This paper explores the development of the smart growth programme in
   Austin, Texas. Drawing on growth machine theory, it documents the
   conflict in Austin in the 1980s and 1990s between pro-growth and
   anti-growth machine coalitions over urban sprawl. Around that time, the
   business community also began to focus on the redevelopment of city's
   downtown and the need to address the problems of crime and homelessness.
   By the mid 1990s, the need to clean up the streets' was increasingly
   coupled with arguments about being green'. It is argued that the
   development of the particular urban sustainability compromise that
   emerged in Austin, which has become a core part of the city's
   competitiveness, was an institutional innovation made possible by
   struggles between the business community and local environmental
   activists. The institutional compromise, however, was achieved only by a
   spatial compromise that shifted the costs of growth from natural
   ecological onto the city's homeless population.}},

Abstract = {{Municipal governments have incorporated brownfield redevelopment
   programmes into urban sustainability plans to encourage the
   redevelopment of these sites into productive uses. The combination of
   government support and developer initiatives indicates potential for the
   gentrification of brownfields. However, developer proposals to expedite
   the conversion of contaminated properties along the Gowanus Canal in New
   York City into residential and commercial venues resulted in the
   addition of the canal to the US National Priorities List (NPL) of
   uncontrolled hazardous sites, rendering the site less attractive to
   developers. It is argued that the listing process became an effective
   tool in the struggle to resist gentrification in the Gowanus Canal
   neighbourhood. Place stigmatisation slowed developer-driven
   redevelopment and the NPL designation allows for a comprehensive
   remediation approach and increases opportunities for community input.
   This study provides an interesting case study of resistance to

Abstract = {{Increasingly, the widely established, globalisation-driven agenda of
   economic competitiveness meets a growing concern with sustainability.
   Yet, the practical and conceptual co-existenceor fusionof these two
   agendas is not always easy. This includes finding and operationalising
   the right' scale of governance, an important question for the pursuit of
   the distinctly transscalar nature of these two policy fields. New
   regionalism' has increasingly been discussed as a pragmatic way of
   tackling the variable spatialities associated with these policy fields
   and their changing articulation. This paper introduces smart (new)
   city-regionalism', derived from the principles of smart growth and new
   regionalism, as a policy-shaping mechanism and analytical framework. It
   brings together the rationales, agreed principles and legitimacies of
   publicly negotiated polity with collaborative, network-based and
   policy-driven spatiality. The notion of smartness', as suggested here as
   central feature, goes beyond the implicit meaning of smart' as in smart
   growth'. When introduced in the later 1990s the term embraced a focus on
   planning and transport. Since then, the adjective smart' has become used
   ever more widely, advocating innovativeness, participation,
   collaboration and co-ordination. The resulting smart city regionalism'
   is circumscribed by the interface between the sectorality and
   territoriality of policy-making processes. Using the examples of
   Vancouver and Seattle, the paper looks at the effects of the resulting
   specific local conditions on adopting smartness' in the scalar
   positioning of policy-making.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an energy management system for smart grids with
   electric vehicles based on hierarchical model predictive control
   (HiMPC). The energy management system realizes load-frequency control
   (LFC), an economic operation and an electric vehicle integration into
   the smart grid. The main component is the HiMPC, which allows covering
   different time scales, regarding constraints (e.g. power ratings) and
   predictions (e.g. on renewable generation), as well as rejecting
   disturbances (e.g. due to fluctuating renewable generation) based on a
   systematic model- and optimization-based design. For the electric
   vehicle integration, an aggregator is proposed as link between HiMPC and
   individual vehicle. The aggregator in particular provides predictions to
   the HiMPC on the availability of electric vehicles for LFC based on the
   current mobility demand and the statistical mobility behavior of the
   vehicle users. Throughout the paper, the energy management system is
   evaluated for the smart grid of an intermediate city.}},

   This study attempts to theoretically analyze case models of smart houses

   that the most significant intelligent values embodied in smart houses
   embrace technologies of the functional automation. In fact, smart houses
   are substantially intertwined with integrated 10 technologies which aim
   to ensure comfortable living environments. Despite the identified
   challenges, the proliferation of smart houses into urban areas requires
   an integration of them in the city for creating intelligent
   environments. As a result, the promotion and integration of smart houses
   with other smarter elements of cities could archive a significant
   enhancement of the quality of life and a stronger urban sustainability.

Abstract = {{In last two decades, increase in mobile devices coupled with
   subscriptions have enabled large proliferation of mobile systems and
   applications'. Apart from traditional services such as voice calls,
   SMSes, today's mobile phones enable array of other services i.e.
   location-based services, multimedia, education, citizen information
   services for the consumers. However, developing mobile system which can
   work on all the mobile devices is still a challenge to solve due to
   large heterogeneity among mobile devices and network. Most of mobile
   systems are built for smartphones, which constitute of only small
   percentage of all mobile devices, rest of devices are feature phones,
   which have limited capability in terms of computation or communication.
   We need to take special design considerations while building mobile
   systems for feature phones. In this paper, we present three of such
   mobile systems, which are carefully designed for mobile phones in
   resource-constrained environments. First, CBS-based localization
   provides a positioning method for feature phones, which works without
   war-driving. Second, a system called Unity that enables collaborative
   download among co-located mobile users and third, a participatory
   sensing system Human Sensors, which enables human-in-loop sensing of
   city problems using a mobile phone.}},

   With the growth of cities, the loading and unloading of goods is a
   priority function whose operation depends to a large extent, the
   effectiveness and efficiency of the implemented technology systems. The
   current operations of loading and unloading in the city is valued, in
   general terms, as unsustainably high costs for environmental, social and
   economic behavior for the whole city. That is why, today, the
   Intelligent Transportation Systems in urban environments Smart are
   experienced a remarkable boom in recent years.
   The system developed is an innovative and intuitive application which
   enables an easy learning of the functionalities and may be simply
   adapted to any case study defined by the user.
   For the resolution of the problem, the system incorporates an algorithm
   based on a combination of the metaheuristics, variable neighbourhood

Abstract = {{Land use change, in the form of urbanization, is one of the most
   significant forms of global change, and most cities are experiencing a
   rapid increase in population and infrastructure growth. However, a
   subset of cities is experiencing a decline in population, which often
   manifests in the abandonment of residential structures. These vacant and
   abandoned structures pose a land use challenge to urban planners, and a
   key question has been how to manage these properties. Often times land
   use management of these structures takes the form of demolition, but the
   elimination of infrastructures and can have unknown and sometimes
   unintended effects on the human-environment interactions in urban areas.
   This paper examines the association between demolitions and crime, a
   human-environment interaction that is fostered by vacant and abandoned
   properties, through a comparative statistical analysis. A cluster
   analysis is performed to identify high and low hot spots of demolition
   and crime activity, specifically assault, drug arrests, and
   prostitution, over a 5-year period. Results show that there is an
   association between the area targeted for significant demolition
   activity and the migration of spatial patterns of certain crimes. The
   direction of crime movement toward the edges of the city limits and in
   the direction of the first ring suburbs highlights the importance of
   regional planning when implementing land use policies for smart decline
   in shrinking cities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The coupled processes of climate change and urbanization pose challenges
   for water resource management in cities worldwide. Comparing the
   vulnerabilities of water systems in Phoenix, Arizona and Portland,
   Oregon, this paper examines (1) exposures to these stressors, (2)
   sensitivities to the associated impacts, and (3) adaptive capacities for
   responding to realized or anticipated impacts. Based on a case study and
   survey-based approach, common points of vulnerability include: rising
   exposures to drier, warmer summers, and suburban growth; increasing
   sensitivities based on demand hardening; and limited capacities due to
   institutional and pro-growth pressures. Yet each region also exhibits
   unique vulnerabilities. Comparatively, Portland shows: amplified
   exposures to seasonal climatic extremes, heightened sensitivity based on
   less diversified municipal water sources and policies that favor more
   trees and other irrigated vegetation, and diminished adaptive capacities
   because of limited attention to demand management and climate planning
   for water resources. Phoenix exhibits elevated exposure from rapid
   growth, heightened sensitivities due to high water demands and
   widespread increases in residential and commercial uses, and limited
   adaptive capacities due to weak land use planning and ``smart growth{''}
   strategies. Unique points of vulnerability suggest pathways for adapting
   to urban-environmental change, whether through water management or land
   planning. Greater coordination between the land and water sectors would
   substantially reduce vulnerabilities in the study regions and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{Energy and environmental technology is one of the most important debates
   among citizens and the government of Finland. As development of
   renewable energy utilization depends on geographical situation, the
   policy and strategic decisions of renewable promotion should focus more
   on regionals studies. Ostrobothnia and its capital Vaasa are among the
   best regions with high potentials of new renewable energy resources
   including wind power, smart grids, biofuels, and geothermal energy in
   Finland. However, high penetration of renewable energies creates
   challenges from supply chain viewpoint including environmental grid
   operators and maintain reliable service. This article discusses the
   development and performance of renewables supply chain in Ostrobothnia
   region and Vaasa city. The presented framework provides managerial
   insights to policy makers of governments and municipalities, as well as
   researchers and other stockholders to consider different aspects of
   diffusion of renewable energy technologies in the regional levels. The
   contributions are also beneficial for further studies related to
   renewable energy development, sources, carriers, and services. (C) 2013

Title = {{Regional Assessment of Urban Impacts on Landcover and Open Space Finds a
   Smart Urban Growth Policy Performs Little Better than Business as Usual}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{Assessment of landscape change is critical for attainment of regional
   sustainability goals. Urban growth assessments are needed because over
   half the global population now lives in cities, which impact
   biodiversity, ecosystem structure and ecological processes. Open space
   protection is needed to preserve these attributes, and provide the
   resources humans need. The San Francisco Bay Area, California, is
   challenged to accommodate a population increase of 3.07 million while
   maintaining the region's ecosystems and biodiversity. Our analysis of
   9275 km(2) in the Bay Area links historic trends for three measures:
   urban growth, protected open space, and landcover types over the last 70
   years to future 2050 projections of urban growth and open space.
   Protected open space totaled 348 km(2) (3.7\% of the area) in 1940, and
   expanded to 2221 km(2) (20.2\%) currently. An additional 1038 km(2) of
   protected open space is targeted (35.1\%). Urban area historically
   increased from 396.5 km(2) to 2239 km(2) (24.1\% of the area). Urban
   growth during this time mostly occurred at the expense of agricultural
   landscapes (62.9\%) rather than natural vegetation. Smart Growth
   development has been advanced as a preferred alternative in many
   planning circles, but we found that it conserved only marginally more
   open space than Business-as-usual when using an urban growth model to
   portray policies for future urban growth. Scenarios to 2050 suggest
   urban development on non-urban lands of 1091, 956, or 179 km(2), under
   Business-as-usual, Smart Growth and Infill policy growth scenarios,
   respectively. The Smart Growth policy converts 88\% of natural lands and
   agriculture used by Business-as-usual, while Infill used only 40\% of
   those lands. Given the historic rate of urban growth, 0.25\%/ year, and
   limited space available, the Infill scenario is recommended. While the
   data may differ, the use of an historic and future framework to track
   these three variables can be easily applied to other metropolitan areas.}},

Title = {{Proof-of-Concept of the Shape Memory Alloy ReseTtable Dual Chamber Lift
   Device for Pedestrian Protection With Tailorable Performance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As automobile use expands in population-dense cities across the world,
   there is a growing need for new approaches to mitigate the consequences
   to pedestrians of pedestrian/automotive collisions. This is especially
   challenging for passive approaches since there is an increasing internal
   space demand that reduces the crush zone between the relatively
   compliant hood and rigid underhood components. One unique approach is an
   active hood lift which raises the hood upon detection of a collision
   with a pedestrian to increase the crush zone. This approach is
   technically challenging due to the fast and accurate timing which is
   sensitive to extrinsic factors (including pedestrian height and weight
   and the need for reusable/automatically resettable functionality. This
   paper presents a novel hood lift concept: the shape memory alloy
   ReseTtable (SMArt) dual chamber lift device which is reusable,
   automatically resettable, and has tunable performance both off-line, and
   on-line to adjust to extrinsic factors. This device is situated under
   the rear corners of the hood and stores energy in the form of compressed
   air in opposing sides of a dual chamber pneumatic cylinder and a
   high-speed shape memory alloy exhaust valve (SEV) vents the upper
   chamber within milliseconds to allow the lower chamber to deploy the
   hood. A general multistage sequential design process is outlined that
   enables lift timing performance to be tailored by parametric design
   off-line and by varying operating parameters on-line. A proof-of-concept
   prototype was built and experimentally characterized for a midsize sedan
   case study confirming the timing, load capability and stroke of the
   device on the benchtop and the complete operational cycle in a
   full-scale automobile hood bay. The impact of additional mass on the
   lift timing was measured and two on-line adjustable operating parameters
   (pressure and valve timing) were investigated for their ability to
   compensate for the mass and other extrinsic effects. While this was a
   limited study of this new active technological approach to pedestrian
   safety, it does indicate promise to meet the strict demands of an active
   lift and a tailorable, resettable/reusable device.}},

Abstract = {{Smart cities have rapidly become a hot topic within technology
   communities, and promise both improved delivery of services to end users
   and reduced environmental impact in an era of unprecedented
   urbanization. Both large high-tech companies and grassroots citizen-led
   initiatives have begun exploring the potential of these technologies.
   Significant barriers remain to the successful rollout and deployment of
   business models outlined for smart city applications and services,
   however. Most of these barriers pertain to an ongoing battle between two
   main schools of thought for system architecture, ICT and
   telecommunications, proposed for data management and service creation.
   Both of these system architectures represent a certain type of value
   chain and the legacy perspective of the respective players that wish to
   enter the smart city arena. Smart cities services, however, utilize
   components of both the ICT industry and mobile telecommunications
   industries, and do not benefit from the current binary perspective of
   system architecture. The business models suggested for the development
   of smart cities require a long-term strategic view of system
   architecture evolution. This article discusses the architectural
   evolution required to ensure that the rollout and deployment of smart
   city technologies is smooth through acknowledging and integrating the
   strengths of both the system architectures proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Machine-to-machine communication, a promising technology for the smart
   city concept, enables ubiquitous connectivity between one or more
   autonomous devices without or with minimal human interaction. M2M
   communication is the key technology to support data transfer among
   sensors and actuators to facilitate various smart city applications (e.
   g., smart metering, surveillance and security, infrastructure
   management, city automation, and eHealth). To support massive numbers of
   machine type communication (MTC) devices, one of the challenging issues
   is to provide an efficient way for multiple access in the network and to
   minimize network overload. In this article, we review the M2M
   communication techniques in Long Term Evolution-Advanced cellular
   networks and outline the major research issues. Also, we review the
   different random access overload control mechanisms to avoid congestion
   caused by random channel access of MTC devices. To this end, we propose
   a reinforcement learning-based eNB selection algorithm that allows the
   MTC devices to choose the eNBs (or base stations) to transmit packets in
   a self-organizing fashion.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet explosion makes energy consumption of the ICT sector a
   global concern. Nowadays, the power consumption of access networks
   increases rapidly due to the rollout of broadband services. Cable access
   networks provide Internet access over the existing cable television
   systems. Among all wired access networks, they have the second biggest
   user base, which is still growing fast due to the release of the new
   industry standard, DOCSIS 3.0. Therefore, we expect that cable access
   networks will play an important role in the ICT sector of future smart
   cities. In order to boost up bidirectional throughput, DOCSIS 3.0
   introduces the channel bonding technology, which could lead to increased
   power consumption if not properly managed. In this article, we present a
   few energy-saving algorithms that could be used by the cable operators
   to improve the energy efficiency of cable access networks using channel
   bonding. The discussions cover both the network-wide energy-saving
   algorithm and the customer-side energy-saving algorithm, and provide
   investigations on the trade-offs between energy-saving and other network
   performance metrics, including packet delay and protocol overhead. Our
   numerical results suggest that effective energy saving can be achieved
   in wideband cable access networks with the proposed algorithms, and the
   packet delay and protocol overhead can be reduced if we choose the key
   parameters properly.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to substantially support
   sustainable development of future smart cities. This article identifies
   the main issues that may prevent IoT from playing this crucial role,
   such as the heterogeneity among connected objects and the unreliable
   nature of associated services. To solve these issues, a cognitive
   management framework for IoT is proposed, in which dynamically changing
   real-world objects are represented in a virtualized environment, and
   where cognition and proximity are used to select the most relevant
   objects for the purpose of an application in an intelligent and
   autonomic way. Part of the framework is instantiated in terms of
   building blocks and demonstrated through a smart city scenario that
   horizontally spans several application domains. This preliminary proof
   of concept reveals the high potential that self-reconfigurable IoT can
   achieve in the context of smart cities.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates how and to what extent the power of collective
   although imprecise intelligence can be employed in smart cities. The
   main visionary goal is to automate the organization of spontaneous and
   impromptu collaborations of large groups of people participating in
   collective actions (i.e., participAct), such as in the notable case of
   urban crowdsensing. In a crowdsensing environment, people or their
   mobile devices act as both sensors that collect urban data and actuators
   that take actions in the city, possibly upon request. Managing the
   crowdsensing process is a challenging task spanning several
   socio-technical issues: from the characterization of the regions under
   control to the quantification of the sensing density needed to obtain a
   certain accuracy; from the evaluation of a good balance between sensing
   accuracy and resource usage (number of people involved, network
   bandwidth, battery usage, etc.) to the selection of good incentives for
   people to participAct (monetary, social, etc.). To tackle these
   problems, this article proposes a crowdsensing platform with three main
   original technical aspects: an innovative geo-social model to profile
   users along different variables, such as time, location, social
   interaction, service usage, and human activities; a matching algorithm
   to autonomously choose people to involve in participActions and to
   quantify the performance of their sensing; and a new Android-based
   platform to collect sensing data from smart phones, automatically or
   with user help, and to deliver sensing/actuation tasks to users.}},

Abstract = {{We have a clear idea today about the necessity and usefulness of making
   cities smarter, the potential market size, and trials and tests.
   However, it seems that business around Smart Cities is having
   difficulties taking off and is thus running short of projected
   potentials. This article looks into why this is the case and proposes a
   procedure to make smart cities happen based on big data exploitation
   through the API stores concept. To this end, we first review involved
   stakeholders and the ecosystem at large. We then propose a viable
   approach to scale business within that ecosystem. We also describe the
   available ICT technologies and finally exemplify all findings by means
   of a sustainable smart city application. Over the course of the article,
   we draw two major observations, which are seen to facilitate sustainable
   smart city development. First, independent smart city departments (or
   the equivalent) need to emerge, much like today's well accepted IT
   departments, which clearly decouple the political element of the
   improved city servicing from the underlying technologies. Second, a
   coherent three-phase smart city rollout is vital, where in phase 1
   utility and revenues are generated; in phase 2 only-utility service is
   also supported; and in phase 3, in addition, a fun/leisure dimension is
   permitted.}},

Abstract = {{Cities are growing steadily, and the process of urbanization is a common
   trend in the world. Although cities are getting bigger, they are not
   necessarily getting better. With the aim to provide citizens with a
   better place to live, a new concept of a city was born: the smart city.
   The real meaning of smart city is not strictly defined, but it has
   gained much attention, and many cities are taking action in order to be
   considered ``smart.{''} These smart cities, founded on the use of
   information and communication technologies, aim at tackling many local
   problems, from local economy and transportation to quality of life and
   e-governance. Although technology helps to solve many of these local
   problems, their ability to gather unprecedented amounts of information
   could endanger the privacy of citizens. In this article we identify a
   number of privacy breaches that can appear within the context of smart
   cities and their services. We leverage some concepts of previously
   defined privacy models and define the concept of citizens' privacy as a
   model with five dimensions: identity privacy, query privacy, location
   privacy, footprint privacy and owner privacy. By means of several
   examples of smart city services, we define each privacy dimension and
   show how existing privacy enhancing technologies could be used to
   preserve citizens' privacy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an intelligent surveillance platform based on the
   usage of large numbers of inexpensive sensors designed and developed
   inside the European Eureka Celtic project HuSIMS. With the aim of
   maximizing the number of deployable units while keeping monetary and

   based on the usage of inexpensive visual sensors which apply efficient
   motion detection and tracking algorithms to transform the video signal
   in a set of motion parameters. In order to automate the analysis of the
   myriad of data streams generated by the visual sensors, the platform's
   control center includes an alarm detection engine which comprises three
   components applying three different Artificial Intelligence strategies
   in parallel. These strategies are generic, domain-independent approaches
   which are able to operate in several domains (traffic surveillance,
   vandalism prevention, perimeter security, etc.). The architecture is
   completed with a versatile communication network which facilitates data
   collection from the visual sensors and alarm and video stream
   distribution towards the emergency teams. The resulting surveillance
   system is extremely suitable for its deployment in metropolitan areas,
   smart cities, and large facilities, mainly because cheap visual sensors
   and autonomous alarm detection facilitate dense sensor network
   deployments for wide and detailed coverage.}},

Abstract = {{Future smart cities will require sensing on a scale hitherto unseen.
   Fixed infrastructures have limitations regarding sensor maintenance,
   placement and connectivity. Employing the ubiquity of mobile phones is
   one approach to overcoming some of these problems. Here, mobility and
   social patterns of phone owners can be exploited to optimize data
   forwarding efficiency. The question remains, how can we stimulate phone
   owners to serve as data relays? In this paper, we combine network
   science principles and Lyapunov optimization techniques, to maximize
   global social profit across this hybrid sensor and mobile phone network.
   Sensor data packets are produced and traded (transmitted) over a virtual
   economic network using a lightweight social-economic-aware backpressure
   algorithm, combining rate control, routing, and resource pricing. Phone
   owners can get benefits through relaying sensor data. Our algorithm is
   fully distributed and makes no probabilistic/stochastic assumptions
   regarding mobility, topology, and channel conditions, nor does it
   require prediction. The global social profit achieved by our algorithm
   can perform close to (or better than) an ideal algorithm with perfect
   prediction- proven by rigorous theoretical analysis. Simulation results
   further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms pure
   backpressure and social-aware schemes; highlighting the advantage of
   building systems combining communication with other types of networks.}},

Abstract = {{Smart growth strategies of infill and compact growth in existing
   suburban cities will most likely not be sufficient to absorb a new US
   household growth in the future. To meet housing demands and preferences,
   master-planned communities will continue to be built in outlying exurban
   areas. However, little is known about the impacts these communities may
   have on the surrounding physical, built and social environment in the
   exurban landscape. In this paper, we provide a review of the literature
   of what is known about the drivers behind the development of
   master-planned communities and the physical, built and social impacts of
   these developments on the surrounding exurban landscape. We then provide
   a case study of an exurban area outside of Seattle, Washington
   containing a large master-planned community. Through focus group
   interviews, we explore residential motivations to move to the area, and
   the benefits and challenges of living in an exurban landscape with a
   newly built master-planned community. Using qualitative data analyses,
   we find that residents are drawn to this exurban area for the abundance
   of natural amenities and outdoor recreation opportunities. However, the
   new master-planned community development presents many benefits and
   challenges for those living in the area; particularly the residential
   perceptions of impacts that the development has had on the surrounding
   natural and built environment. These real and perceived impacts of the
   master-planned community development has compounded and magnified the
   impacts to the social environment throughout the entire exurban
   community. Implications for planners and suggestions for future research
   are given. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   energy use}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{314-320}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Household energy accounts for one of the major contributors to the
   countries energy balances. It has been shown, that an effective way to
   achieve energy saving in that sector, is by providing consumers with
   information and feedback. This measure increases home inhabitants'
   awareness that leads to behavioral changes, and could help reduce energy
   consumption between 15\% and 25\% in some cases. Inhabitants' energy use
   awareness is also crucial for the success of demand response programs;
   one of the most important features of smart-grid adoption for the
   current and upcoming smart cities.
   The effects of different feedback strategies and information devices in
   households located in different cities in Sweden have been evaluated in
   this paper, since the impact on users' behavior of this feedback
   information vary depending on the way it is provided.
   Mobile text messages (SMSs) and digital displays placed in the
   building's common areas did not cause any noticeable behavioral changes,
   while the use of a TV channel and personal in-home displays were the
   most popular devices amongst households with high incomes.
   This paper concluded that even though feedback helped reduce domestic
   energy consumption and induce behavioral changes, it only reaches the
   consumers interested in it. It is important therefore to provide
   customized information to the consumer and select precise feedback tools
   for specific household groups. Special attention should be paid to
   increasing the energy consumption awareness in households with low
   income levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   The literature offers inconclusive and inconsistent results. This paper
   uses new data covering all U.S. metropolitan areas and multiple time

   misleadingly suggests that growth management increases urban area
   extent. However, fixed-effect estimates across different growth

Abstract = {{High-rise buildings are a common feature of urban cities around the
   world. These flexible structures frequently exhibit large vibration due
   to strong winds and earthquakes. Structural control has been employed as
   an effective means to mitigate excessive responses; however, structural
   control mechanisms that can be used in tall buildings are limited
   primarily to mass and liquid dampers. An attractive alternative can be
   found in outrigger damping systems, where the bending deformation of the
   building is transformed into shear deformation across dampers placed
   between the outrigger and the perimeter columns. The outrigger system
   provides additional damping that can reduce structural responses, such
   as the floor displacements and accelerations. This paper investigates
   the potential of using smart dampers, specifically magnetorheological
   (MR) fluid dampers, in the outrigger system. First, a high-rise building
   is modeled to portray the St. Francis Shangri-La Place in Philippines.
   The optimal performance of the outrigger damping system for mitigation
   of seismic responses in terms of damper size and location also is
   subsequently evaluated. The efficacy of the semi-active damped outrigger
   system is finally verified through numerical simulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an intelligent streetlight management system based

   traditional wired systems, which always need civil engineering for
   burying of cable underground and consequently are more expensive than if
   the connection of the different nodes is made over the air. The deployed
   solution will be aware of their surrounding's environmental conditions,
   a fact that will be approached for the system intelligence in order to
   learn, and later, apply dynamic rules. The knowledge of real time
   illumination needs, in terms of instant use of the street in which it is
   installed, will also feed our system, with the objective of providing
   tangible solutions to reduce energy consumption according to the
   contextual needs, an exact calculation of energy consumption and

   Plan and the enacting of a program of controlled or managed shrinkage.
   It is argued that while the program of redevelopment has had an impact
   on Youngstown and its national image, it represents an exclusionary
   project that has centered on redeveloping downtown areas and neglected
   many city neighborhoods which continue to experience high levels of
   unemployment, vacancy, and crime. The analysis is situated in relation
   to the contemporary literature on shrinking cities. Youngstown's
   experience raises critical questions regarding the nature of the
   challenges facing shrinking cities, the constraints on actions available
   to them due to state and federal funding, and the coherence of the

Abstract = {{Sustainability, safety and smartness are three key elements of a modern
   transportation system. This study illustrates various policy directions
   and initiatives of Singapore to address how its transportation system is
   progressing in light of these three components. Sustainability targets
   economical efficiency, environmental justice and social equity by
   including policies for integrating land use and transport planning,
   ensuring adequate transport supply measures, managing travel demand
   efficiently, and incorporating environment-friendly strategies. Safety
   initiatives of its transportation system aim to minimize injuries and
   incidents of all users including motorists, public transport commuters,
   pedestrians, and bicyclists. Smartness incorporates qualities like real
   time sensing, fast processing and decision making, and automated
   action-taking into its control, monitoring, information management and
   revenue collection systems. Various policy implications and technology
   applications along these three directions reveal that smart technologies
   facilitate implementation of policies promoting sustainability and
   safety. The Singapore experience could serve as a good reference for
   other cities in promoting a transportation system that is sustainable,

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks improve the quality of human daily life like

   network architecture using general mobile devices in order to provide
   more efficient and valuable sensor network application and services. The
   proposed system architecture is based on IEEE 802.15.4-2006 standard
   with smart mobile devices. We also show some scenarios with on-demand
   request and real time event driven data to show the feasibility of the
   proposed architecture using five kinds of sensors such as magnetic,

Abstract = {{The paper outlines energy management concepts and the smart grid
   evolution. The necessity of considering energy management as a crucial
   innovation in load supplying to permit a more powerful penetration of
   renewable energy usage at the building and city level and to perform
   energy savings and CO2 emissions reduction is pointed out. The driving
   factors to enhance the current power distribution are presented, and the
   benefits concerning smart grids are underlined. In the paper, a specific
   energy management analysis is reported by considering all the electric
   value chain, and the demand-side management and distributed on site
   control actions are described. To verify the benefit of energy
   management control actions, a house simulator and a grid simulator are
   here presented and the results discussed in three different scenarios.
   Moreover, in the paper, the evaluation of ecological benefits are
   reported, and a cost benefit analysis of the energy management system is
   performed. Results pointed out that with the standard control actions,
   the system is not economic for the end user, and only by using energy
   management systems with renewable energy, in site production
   remunerative energy savings can be reached. Finally the evolution of
   smart grids is presented, focusing on potential benefits and technical
   problems. The active grids, micro-grids and virtual utility are
   described, and final consideration on hypothetical scenarios is
   presented in the conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{The modeling of human mobility is adopting new directions due to the
   increasing availability of big data sources from human activity. These
   sources enclose digital information about daily visited locations of a
   large number of individuals. Examples of these data include: mobile
   phone calls, credit card transactions, bank notes dispersal, check-ins
   in internet applications, among several others. In this study, we
   consider the data obtained from smart subway fare card transactions to
   characterize and model urban mobility patterns. We present a simple
   mobility model for predicting peoples' visited locations using the
   popularity of places in the city as an interaction parameter between
   different individuals. This ingredient is sufficient to reproduce
   several characteristics of the observed travel behavior such as: the
   number of trips between different locations in the city, the exploration
   of new places and the frequency of individual visits of a particular
   location. Moreover, we indicate the limitations of the proposed model
   and discuss open questions in the current state of the art statistical
   models of human mobility.}},

Abstract = {{In ubiquitous environments, the exchange of different types of real-time
   video data can be extremely useful under various circumstances,
   particularly during disasters. For instance, in the wake of a
   catastrophe, it would be extremely important to assure real-time
   transmission of video data of escape routes, nearby regions of safety,
   and the locations of survivors. To assure real-time transmission of
   video, it is necessary to ensure stable bandwidth streaming and to
   minimize data loss. In most cases, real-time streaming is more sensitive
   to delays between frames rather than to errors that affect the quality
   of one frame. One possible approach for ensuring low-delay, real-time
   streaming is to control the quantization parameter value according to
   network channel conditions. In this paper, we describe such an approach
   for a continuous real-time streaming system for smart ubiquitous
   middleware (SmartUM), called network bandwidth adaptive scalable
   real-time video streaming (NARS). NARS is an integrated video data
   management system for the ubiquitous-city environment. It ensures
   continuity of real-time video streaming as well as scalability of
   transmission by supporting various user devices. This system can be
   applied to various ubiquitous systems.}},

Abstract = {{Modern cities in the open European space-economy are powerhouses of
   creative ideas, smart technologies, sustainable developments and
   socio-economic wealth. They play a pivotal role in the future of an
   urbanized Europe, but they are also confronted with grand challenges,
   notably far-reaching demographic transformations, environmental decay
   and climatological change, unequal social participation and ever-rising
   mobility trends. The challenges for urban environments may be turned
   into new opportunities, in particular, in such domains as advanced
   infrastructure and logistic systems, environmental and climate-neutral
   facilities, creative and knowledge-intensive strategies for
   socio-economic prosperity and well-being. Citiesand in particular
   metropolitan areasmay thus act as spearheads of sustainable economic
   growth for European countries. These observations call for appropriate
   long-range policy strategies for metropolitan areasand networks of
   citiesin the highly diversified European space-economy. Such policy
   actions would need to be supported by solid, multidisciplinary and
   evidence-based research on the challenges and opportunities of urban
   environments in Europe. The main contribution of this paper lies in the
   systematic strategic approach to transform urban megatrends and
   challenges into research and policy concerns for Europe. The analytical
   framework employed to highlight and better understand such research and
   policy response in Europe from a typological perspective is built around
   four interconnected pillars (cornerstones) that form the focal points
   for identifying strategic future images that may be instrumental in
   mapping out the research and policy challenges for the New Urban Europe.}},

   of the detection and interdiction of terror plots by undercover agents,
   the staffing models developed respond to objectives such as: prevent a
   specified fraction of terror attacks, maximize the benefits- minus-costs
   of preventing attacks, staff in expectation that smart terrorists will
   attack with a rate that optimizes their outcomes, and allocate a fixed
   number of agents across groups to equalize detection rates, or prevent
   as many attacks as possible, or prevent as many attack casualties as

Abstract = {{Waste and recycling systems are complex and far-reaching, but its
   mechanisms are poorly understood by the public, in some cases government
   organizations and even the waste management sector itself. The lack of
   empirical data makes it challenging to assess the environmental impact
   of trash collection, removal and disposal. This is especially the case
   for the global movement of electronic wastes. Senseable City Lab's Trash
   Track project tackles this scarcity of data by following the
   trajectories of individual objects. The project presents a methodology
   involving active location sensors that were placed on end-of-life
   products donated by volunteers in the Seattle, Washington area. These
   tags sent location messages chronicling their journey, some over the
   course of a month or more. In this paper, the authors focus on the
   analysis of traces acquired from 146 items of electronic waste,
   estimating evaluating the environmental impact, including the travel
   distances and end-of-life treatments for the products. Combining this
   information with impact evaluation from the US Environmental Protection
   Agency's Waste Reduction Model (WARM) allows for the creation of
   environmental impact profiles for individual pieces of trash.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Installing roofs with high solar reflectance and high thermal emittance,
   known as ``Cool roofs,{''} are becoming increasingly popular because of
   their cooling energy saving potentials, cost effectiveness and
   sustainability. Lower surface temperature of cool roofs may affect the
   hygrothermal performance of roofing systems and hence their performance
   should be characterized in different climates.
   We simulated the performance of several roofing systems including:
   typical, smart, and self-drying roofs for residential and commercial
   buildings. In addition, we proposed vented roofs with smart vapor
   retarders in very cold climate regions across North America. We also
   developed an algorithm to investigate the effect of snow on hygrothermal
   behaviour of dark and white roofs.
   Results showed that office buildings never experience moisture
   accumulation problems during the simulation period (5 years). In
   residential buildings, white typical roofing compositions with
   conventional vapor retarders experienced moisture accumulation problems
   in very cold cities such as Anchorage, Edmonton and St. John's. Using
   smart vapor retarder (smart roofs) or self-drying roofs helped to
   decrease risk of moisture accumulation. In these climates, adding a
   ventilated air space along with using smart vapor retarder eliminated
   the risk of moisture accumulation and prevented excessive OSB (oriented
   strand board) moisture content. The risk of mold growth was
   significantly lowered in vented smart roofs. Simulating the effect of
   snow on the roofs for Anchorage, Montreal and Chicago showed that the
   hygrothermal performances of white roofs improved with snow accumulation
   on the roof. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Of the many public initiatives used to promote the use of bicycles in
   the urban environment, the one that has achieved the most spectacular
   results in a short period of time is the public bicycle hire system. The
   experience of Seville is one of the most successful internationally,
   where 6.6 \% of mechanised trips were being made by bicycle within 30
   months. This paper analyses this experience in the university community,
   which represents one-third of system users. We conclude that the people
   who are most satisfied with the system are those who use it for leisure
   and recreation activities, non-residents of the city, more
   environmentally aware people and those who have no alternative mode of
   transportation. Their satisfaction is also closely linked to their
   appreciation of the bicycles' level of comfort, the ease with which
   users can hire bicycles and return them and the small amount of
   paperwork involved required to sign up for the system. However, user
   appreciation has fallen over time because the system's rapid success has
   caused it to become overloaded. This experience therefore provides one
   main lesson: the system's success can result in eventual difficulties.}},

Abstract = {{Firms and other organizations use Technology Roadmapping (TRM)
   extensively as a framework for supporting research and development of
   future technologies and products that could sustain a competitive

   this paper is to introduce an integrated roadmapping process for
   services, devices and technologies capable of implementing a smart city
   development R\&D project in Korea. The paper applies a QFD (Quality
   Function Deployment) method to establish interconnections between
   services and devices, and between devices and technologies. The method
   is illustrated by a detailed case study, which shows how different types
   of roadmap can be coordinated with each other to produce a clear

Title = {{Smart Event Traffic Management: Impact on the Central Florida Regional
   Transportation Network and Lessons Learned}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2396}},
Pages = {{107-116}},
Abstract = {{In 2008 the City of Orlando, Florida, embarked on construction of a new
   Amway Center to replace the existing Amway Arena. The new center was
   designed to host a variety of events such as concerts, arena football,
   graduation ceremonies, National Collegiate Athletic Association
   basketball, and the National Basketball Association's (NBA's) Orlando
   Magic home games. The Amway Center, which opened in October 2010, had a
   capacity of 19,000 patrons for NBA games. The Amway Center was adjacent
   to Interstate 4 and State Road 408 in the downtown core. To prepare for
   the Amway Center's event management challenges, the City of Orlando's
   Transportation Engineering Department utilized smart event traffic
   management techniques, which integrated the following system and plan
   components: intelligent transportation system infrastructure (software
   and hardware), traffic control device upgrades, regional planning
   efforts, and state-of-the-art safety and security protocols. These
   components also helped minimize the environmental impacts of traffic
   congestion. When designing smart event plans, it is important to
   consider high-threshold events such as the NBA All-Star Game for system
   performance and to understand the balance required for operational
   efficiency and security in today's global climate. In addition,
   infrastructure performance is critical during high-profile events so
   that the local economy can benefit and the municipality can stay
   competitive to attract more of these types of events. Finally, the
   resultant operational efficiency is vital for reducing the carbon
   footprint and negative societal impacts.}},

Title = {{Direct Ridership Models of Bus Rapid Transit and Metro Systems in Mexico
   City, Mexico}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2394}},
Pages = {{93-99}},
Abstract = {{Direct ridership models (DRM) have been introduced in the United States
   as an alternative to four-step travel demand modeling. DRMs can be used
   to obtain quick, order-of-magnitude estimates of transit patronage at a
   fraction of the cost of a full travel demand model and are more adept at
   capturing the effects of smart growth on transit ridership. The
   relatively low cost, flexible data requirements, and rapidity make these
   models particularly suited to developing world cities. Yet these cities
   still rely almost exclusively on full travel demand models to advise
   investments in new transit infrastructure. In doing so, cities often use
   old data and out-of-date household surveys and do not capture important
   recent changes in travel patterns. Mexico City, Mexico, is taken as a
   case study to illustrate the benefits of using DRM models in a
   developing world context. Ridership models are developed for the city's
   bus rapid transit and Metro networks to study how land use and service
   and station attributes affect ridership for each mode and also how
   connections between bus rapid transit and Metro affect each other's
   ridership. The two systems are complementary, each getting ridership
   benefits from connecting to the other. Implications of findings for
   transport policy in Mexico City are discussed, as well as some
   shortcomings of DRM models, particularly their difficulty in accounting
   for informal transit.}},

   System}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Activities in laboratories, workshops, and offices can be significantly
   affected by their ambiance and environmental conditions, such as
   lighting, humidity, and temperature. This research focuses on
   laboratories and aims to improve people's performance of activities
   inside them. To this end, we have developed a cyber-physical system(CPS)
   for a smart/intelligent laboratory environment which is able to
   dynamically and automatically interpret and regulate environmental
   conditions. In this paper, we present the CPS development framework. The
   proposed CPS can measure, analyze, and regulate the thermal comfort. In
   order to prolong the lifetime of the system, mechanisms for low-volume
   communication, distributed computation, and habit-based adaptive control
   are proposed. Evaluations of an on-site deployment verify the
   functionality of the proposed CPS. Although our focus is on
   laboratories, this research can be applied to other similar
   environments, which are intended to support human performance and
   productivity, and has implications for the creation of smart cities.}},

Title = {{SMArc: A Proposal for a Smart, Semantic Middleware Architecture Focused
   on Smart City Energy Management}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Among the main features that are intended to become part of what can be
   expected from the Smart City, one of them should be an improved energy
   management system, in order to benefit from a healthier relation with
   the environment, minimize energy expenses, and offer dynamic market
   opportunities. A Smart Grid seems like a very suitable infrastructure
   for this objective, as it guarantees a two-way information flow that
   will provide the means for energy management enhancement. However, to
   obtain all the required information, another entity must care about all
   the devices required to gather the data. What is more, this entity must
   consider the lifespan of the devices within the Smart Grid-when they are
   turned on and off or when new appliances are added-along with the
   services that devices are able to provide. This paper puts forward
   SMArc-an acronym for semantic middleware architecture-as a middleware
   proposal for the Smart Grid, so as to process the collected data and use
   it to insulate applications from the complexity of the metering
   facilities and guarantee that any change that may happen at these lower
   levels will be updated for future actions in the system.}},

Title = {{SSE: A Secure Searchable Encryption Scheme for Urban Sensing and
   Querying}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{With the distributed sensors that are deployed to monitor the urban
   environment in smart cities, the sensed data are overwhelming and beyond
   the scope of the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) capability. Due to the
   communication range limits of the sensors, most of these data will be
   outsourced and stored on some untrusted servers. Thus, how to maintain
   the data confidentiality and integrity, as well as source authentication
   and data query privacy of the outsourced data, is a challenging problem.
   In this paper, we propose a secure searchable encryption scheme, named
   SSE, for urban sensing and querying to address the problem.
   Specifically, our SSE constructs a secure hidden vector
   encryption-(HVE-) based rang query predicate. The sensed data can be
   stored on an untrusted server in encrypted form. A requester can obtain
   the correct ciphertexts when his authorized range query matches the
   HVE-based encryption predicate. With the help of the base station, the
   ciphertexts can be decrypted and data integrity can be verified; then,
   the requester can obtain the correct original data. Security analysis
   demonstrates that; in the SSE, only the authorized requesters can obtain
   the query results, while the data confidentiality and integrity and
   source authentication are also preserved.}},

Title = {{Reliable Graph Routing in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Research studies on smart cities have been conducted, which will enable
   a better management of the available resources. Industrial wireless
   sensor networks (IWSNs) are important part of smart city. IWSNs are used
   for process measurement and control applications in harsh and noisy
   industrial environments. As substitutes for traditional wired industrial
   networks, IWSNs are more flexible, scalable, and efficient. However,
   resource limitation of the sensor nodes and unreliability of low-power
   wireless links, in combination with stringent quality of the service
   (QoS) requirements of industrial applications, imposes many challenges
   in designing efficient routing for IWSNs. Existing standards propose a
   simple and reliable routing mechanism named graph routing. In this
   paper, we propose novel routing algorithms to discover reliable paths
   and construct reliable routing graphs. In our approaches, the
   centralized manager selects parent nodes for each node in the network to
   satisfy reliability requirements of the intended application. We try to
   maximize the number of reliable nodes and change the parent nodes
   selection strategy along with the link quality and the link correlation.
   Our design is evaluated using simulation where we show that our
   algorithm could achieve a balance between routing reliability and
   overhead.}},

Abstract = {{The increase in urbanisation is making the management of city resources
   a difficult task. Data collected through observations (utilising humans
   as sensors) of the city surroundings can be used to improve decision
   making in terms of managing these resources. However, the data collected

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2359}},
Pages = {{10-16}},
Abstract = {{This paper documents the methodological approach and findings of an
   evaluation process for a smart parking application that provides
   real-time information on parking availability. The initiative is in
   response to the increased demand for parking spaces in the Pittsburgh,
   Pennsylvania, Cultural District and the desire to improve patrons'
   parking experiences. Primary data, obtained through semistructured
   interviews and in-person and online surveys of patrons, were utilized
   for the stakeholder analysis, baseline data, process evaluation, and
   outcome evaluation phases. Secondary data that utilized count data
   obtained from website usage logs were employed for the output evaluation
   phase. The contributions of the evaluation framework are the insights it
   provides on how the key challenges created by the unique environment
   within which the system was deployed were addressed. The framework could
   also be employed to tackle response-shift bias through a binary system
   approach that uniquely identifies distinct cohorts of respondents. The
   report is especially timely given the prohibitive cost of employing a
   supply-side approach to address parking problems in cities, the ease of
   replicating the evaluation framework and the product design, and the
   wealth of information the study provides to the body of knowledge about
   the evaluation of technological products.}},

Title = {{A Case Study of Sensor Data Collection and Analysis in Smart City:
   Provenance in Smart Food Supply Chain}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Accelerated growth of urban population in the world put incremental
   stresses on metropolitan cities. Smart city centric strategies are
   expected to comprise solutions to sustainable environment and urban
   life. Acting as an indispensable role in smart city, IoT (Internet of
   Things) connects the executive ability of the physical world and the
   intelligence of the computational world, aiming to enlarge the
   capabilities of things in real city and strengthen the practicality of
   functions in cyber world. One of the important application areas of IoT
   in cities is food industry. Municipality governors are withstanding all
   kinds of food safety issues and enduring the hardest time ever due to
   the lack of sufficient guidance and supervision. IoT systems help to
   monitor, analyze, and manage the real food industry in cities. In this
   paper, a smart sensor data collection strategy for IoT is proposed,
   which would improve the efficiency and accuracy of provenance with the
   minimized size of data set at the same time. We then present algorithms
   of tracing contamination source and back tracking potential infected
   food in the markets. Our strategy and algorithms are evaluated with a
   comprehensive evaluation case of this IoT system, which shows that this
   system performs well even with big data as well.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is about the introduction of an electric car rental system in
   the city of Amsterdam. These cars can be used as an alternative to
   public transport or taxis by travelers or tourists arriving at train
   stations or park houses who want to reach places in the inner city.
   After the trip, cars will be parked in one of the park houses
   distributed over the city close to the traveler's destination. Electric
   cars will be used to reduce the pollution in the inner part of the city.
   To facilitate the drivers a dedicated navigation system has been
   designed including lanes not accessible by private cars. This dynamic
   routing system is based on the Ant Based Routing algorithm. It has been
   implemented on the power line infrastructure of streetlights. Cars are
   wirelessly connected to lampposts using their smart phone. The cameras
   attached to the lampposts will be used to localize, identify and track
   the cars and enable updates of the routing tables in the navigation
   system. The network of distributed streetlights/cameras is the backbone
   of the Park and Routing-system. A software prototype of the system has
   been implemented. We will report about the simulated system and the test
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The compatibility between an agenda for sustainable urban development
   and the neoliberal economic restructuring of urban space has been
   observed within cities in developed countries across the globe. From
   providing economic support to local `green' industries to creating bike
   lanes, municipalities develop sustainability strategies that are
   designed to boost their competitive advantage. Moreover, municipalities
   are responding to demands from popular social movements and national
   governments that seek to reconfigure societal relationships with the
   natural environment in cities. Cities are increasingly understood not as
   part of the ecological crisis but as part of the solution, or as places
   where alternative patterns of sustainable consumption and new socially
   and ecologically responsible industries can be developed. Over the last
   decade in Austin, environmental sustainability has become an uncontested
   paradigm that has progressively shaped the city's urban space and
   policy. Two competing conceptualizations of the environment, so-called
   `environmental' and `just' sustainability groups, are explored in this
   article. I demonstrate how the notion of environmental sustainability
   has been selectively incorporated into the hegemonic vision of Austin's
   strategic growth plan. I argue that the dominance of this
   conceptualization is best understood by asking what counts as the
   `environment' for environmentalists, and understanding the unstated
   assumptions about the environment shared by the business community and
   environmentalists.}},

Abstract = {{In a world where resources are scarce and urban areas consume the vast
   majority of these resources, it is vital to make cities greener and more
   sustainable. Advanced systems to improve and automate processes within a
   city will play a leading role in smart cities. From smart design of
   buildings, which capture rain water for later use, to intelligent
   control systems, which can monitor infrastructures autonomously, the
   possible improvements enabled by sensing technologies are immense.
   Ubiquitous sensing poses numerous challenges, which are of a
   technological or social nature. This paper presents an overview of the
   state of the art with regards to sensing in smart cities. Topics include
   sensing applications in smart cities, sensing platforms and technical
   challenges associated with these technologies. In an effort to provide a
   holistic view of how sensing technologies play a role in smart cities, a
   range of applications and technical challenges associated with these
   applications are discussed. As some of these applications and
   technologies belong to different disciplines, the material presented in
   this paper attempts to bridge these to provide a broad overview, which
   can be of help to researchers and developers in understanding how
   advanced sensing can play a role in smart cities.}},

Title = {{Synergic and conflicting issues in planning underground use to produce
   energy in densely populated countries, as Italy Geological storage of
   CO2, natural gas, geothermics and nuclear waste disposal}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{393-412}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In densely populated countries there is a growing and compelling need to
   use underground for different and possibly coexisting technologies to
   produce ``low carbon{''} energy. These technologies include (i) clean
   coal combustion merged with CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS); (ii)
   last-generation nuclear power or, in any case, safe nuclear wastes
   disposal, both ``temporary{''} and ``geological{''} somewhere in Europe
   (at least in one site): Nuclear wastes are not necessarily associated to
   nuclear power plants; (iii) safe natural gas (CH4) reserves to allow
   consumption also when the foreign pipelines are less available or not
   available for geopolitical reasons and (iv) ``low-space-consuming{''}
   renewables in terms of Energy Density Potential in Land (EDPL measured
   in {[}GW h/ha/year]) as geothermics. When geothermics is exploited as
   low enthalpy technology, the heat/cool production could be associated,
   where possible, to increased measures of ``building efficiency{''}, low
   seismic risks building reworking and low-enthalpy heat managing. This is
   undispensable to build up ``smart cities{''}. In any case the
   underground geological knowledge is prerequisite.
   All these technologies have been already proposed and defined by the
   International Energy Agency (IEA) Road Map 2009 as priorities for
   worldwide security: all need to use underground in a rational and safe
   manner. The underground is not renewable in most of case histories
   110,14 IEA recently matched and compared different technologies in a
   unique ``Clean Energy Economy{''} improved document (Paris, November
   16-17, 2011), by the contribution of this vision too (see reference).
   In concert with ``energy efficiency{''} improvement both for plants and
   buildings, in the frame of the ``smart cities{''} scenarios, and the
   upstanding use of ``energy savings{''}, the energetic planning on
   regional scale where these cities are located, are strategic for the
   year 2050: this planning is strongly depending by the underground
   availability and typology. Therefore, if both literature and European
   Policy are going fast to improve the concept of ``smart cities{''} this
   paper stresses the concept of ``smart regions{''}, more strategic than
   ``smart cities{''}, passing throughout a discussion on the synergic and
   conflicting use of underground to produce energy for the ``smart
   regions{''} as a whole.
   The paper highlights the research lines which are urgent to plan the
   soundest energy mix for each region by considering the underground
   performances case by case: a worldwide mapping, by GIS tools of this
   kind of information could be strategic for all the ``world energy
   management{''} authorities, up to ONU, with its Intergovernmental Panel
   on Climate Change (IPCC), the G20, the Carbon Sequestration Leadership
   Forum (CSLF) and the European Platforms such as the ``Zero Emissions
   Fossil Fuel Power Plants{''} (EU-ZEP Platform), the Steel Platform, the
   Biomass Platform too. All of these organizations agree on the need for
   synergistic and coexistent uses of underground for geological storage of
   CO2, CH4, nuclear waste and geothermic exploitation.
   The paper is therefore a discussion of the tools, methods and approaches
   to these underground affecting technologies, after a gross view of the
   different uses of underground to produce energy for each use, with their
   main critical issues (i.e. public acceptance in different cases).
   The paper gives some gross evaluation for the Lazio Region and some
   hints from the Campania Region, located in Central Italy. Energy Density
   Potential in Land (EDPL), is calculated for each renewable energy
   technology (solar, wind, geothermal) highlighting the potentiality of
   the last.
   Why the Italian case history among the densely populated countries? on
   the Italian territory is hard to find suitable areas (mostly if
   greenfields) to use the own underground, with respect to other European
   countries, due to the presence of seismotectonic activity and many
   faulted areas characterized by Diffuse Degassing Structures (DDSs, which
   are rich in CO2 and CH4). In this cases, public acceptance must be
   facilitated by the concerted efforts of researchers, universities, NGOs
   and policy-makers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a smart driving direction system leveraging the
   intelligence of experienced drivers. In this system, GPS-equipped taxis
   are employed as mobile sensors probing the traffic rhythm of a city and
   taxi drivers' intelligence in choosing driving directions in the
   physical world. We propose a time-dependent landmark graph to model the
   dynamic traffic pattern as well as the intelligence of experienced
   drivers so as to provide a user with the practically fastest route to a
   given destination at a given departure time. Then, a
   Variance-Entropy-Based Clustering approach is devised to estimate the
   distribution of travel time between two landmarks in different time
   slots. Based on this graph, we design a two-stage routing algorithm to
   compute the practically fastest and customized route for end users. We
   build our system based on a real-world trajectory data set generated by
   over 33,000 taxis in a period of three months, and evaluate the system
   by conducting both synthetic experiments and in-the-field evaluations.
   As a result, 60-70 percent of the routes suggested by our method are
   faster than the competing methods, and 20 percent of the routes share
   the same results. On average, 50 percent of our routes are at least 20
   percent faster than the competing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{We present a multipronged comparative study of citizens' self-proclaimed
   information needs and actual information seeking behavior in smart urban
   spaces. We first conducted several user studies to identify the types of
   information services that citizens believed to be useful in urban
   setting utilizing methods ranging from contextual inquiry with lo-fi
   prototypes to ``card sorting{''} exercise with a separate set of
   participants, and finally to implementing selected services. We then
   made a sizeable constructive intervention into the urban space by
   deploying in a city center 12 large, interactive public displays called
   ``hotspots{''} to offer a wide range of previously identified
   information services. We collected comprehensive qualitative and
   quantitative data on the usage of the hotspots and their services by the
   general public during 13 months. Our study reveals discrepancies between
   a priori and a posteriori information seeking strategies extracted from
   the self-proclaimed information needs and the actual usage of the
   hotspots.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of wireless sensors has given rise to public sensing
   (PS) as a vibrant data sharing model. This vision can be extended under
   the umbrella of the Internet of Things (IoT) to include versatile data
   sources within smart cities such as cell phones, radio frequency
   identification tags and sensors on roads, and buildings and living
   spaces. The facilitation of such a vision faces many challenges in terms
   of inter operability, resource management, and pricing. In this paper,
   we present a priced PS framework for IoT architectures. Our framework
   caters for service-based applications in smart cities where data is
   provided via a data cloud of multifarious data sources. We propose
   online heuristics for public data delivery in smart city settings. We
   also introduce a pricing utility function for data acquisition. Our
   pricing function considers resource limitations in terms of delay,
   capacity and lifetime on the data providers' side, as well as user's
   quality and trust requirements from the requesters' side. We present
   simulation results showing the efficiency of our scheme as compared with
   other wireless sensor and mobile ad-hoc schemes with respect to
   scalability, lifetime, delay, delivery ratio, and price.}},

Abstract = {{As a prominent subcategory of cyber-physical systems, mobile
   cyber-physical systems could take advantage of widely used mobile
   devices, such as smartphones, as a convenient and economical platform
   that facilitates sophisticated and ubiquitous mobile sensing
   applications between humans and the surrounding physical world. This
   paper presents Vita, a novel mobile cyber-physical system for
   crowdsensing applications, which enables mobile users to perform mobile
   crowdsensing tasks in an efficient manner through mobile devices. Vita
   provides a flexible and universal architecture across mobile devices and
   cloud computing platforms by integrating the service-oriented
   architecture with resource optimization mechanism for crowd sensing,
   with extensive supports to application developers and end users. The
   customized platform of Vita enables intelligent deployments of tasks
   between humans in the physical world, and dynamic collaborations of
   services between mobile devices and cloud computing platform during
   run-time of mobile devices with service failure handling support. Our
   practical experiments show that Vita performs its tasks efficiently with
   a low computation and communication overhead on mobile devices, and
   eases the development of multiple mobile crowdsensing applications and
   services. In addition, we present a mobile crowdsensing application,
   Smart City, developed on Vita to demonstrate the functionalities and

Title = {{Development of a temporal and spatial linkage between transit demand and
   land-use patterns}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND LAND USE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{33-46}},
Abstract = {{We are exploring ways to capture the temporal and spatial dimensions of
   the use of public transit. Specifically, we are investigating how
   different land uses affect the spatial and temporal demand for public
   transit services. Spatially, the availability of new data collection
   technology in public transit allows us to examine transit demand at the
   individual stop level. Our hypothesis, however, is that transit users'
   activity may not be originated from or destined to an individual stop
   per se; rather, the activity is associated with a specific location in
   the vicinity of the stop, and this location may be ``covered{''} by
   several adjacent transit stops. More importantly, understanding the
   transit demand at this aggregate level (an aggregate ``catchment{''}
   area) can enhance the ability to define a specific land-use type and the
   temporal characteristics related to passengers' activities. Temporally,
   we seek to understand the relationship between the demand for public
   transit service at specific times of the day and the associated land
   uses that may strongly influence the timing of that demand. To explore
   these dimensions, this study: 1) proposes a method of stop aggregation;
   2) generates transit service areas based on these aggregated stops; 3)
   develops a set of metrics to better represent land-use types within
   these service areas; and 4) examines the spatial and temporal
   characteristics of transit demand for these service areas. These methods
   are applied to a case study using land-use and transit demand data from
   the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Today's organizations require techniques for automated transformation of
   their large data volumes into operational knowledge. This requirement
   may be addressed by using event recognition systems that detect
   events/activities of special significance within an organization, given
   streams of `low-level' information that is very difficult to be utilized
   by humans. Consider, for example, the recognition of attacks on nodes of
   a computer network given the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
   Protocol messages, the recognition of suspicious trader behaviour given
   the transactions in a financial market and the recognition of whale
   songs given a symbolic representation of whale sounds. Various event
   recognition systems have been proposed in the literature. Recognition
   systems with a logic-based representation of event structures, in
   particular, have been attracting considerable attention, because, among
   others, they exhibit a formal, declarative semantics, they have proven
   to be efficient and scalable and they are supported by machine learning
   tools automating the construction and refinement of event structures. In
   this paper, we review representative approaches of logic-based event
   recognition and discuss open research issues of this field. We
   illustrate the reviewed approaches with the use of a real-world case
   study: event recognition for city transport management.}},

Abstract = {{Employing different energy carrier networks in connection with
   distributed renewable energy generation is an attractive way to improve
   energy sustainability in urban areas. An effective option to increase
   local renewable energy production is to convert surplus electricity into
   e.g. thermal energy. Here a methodology to study such multi-carrier
   urban energy systems is presented which enables to analyze spatial
   energy demand and supply, and spatial energy flows. The results indicate
   that in a northern midsized city wind power coupled both to an electric
   grid and a district heating network could raise the allowable wind
   capacity over the non-heat case by 40-200\%. In an Asian megacity
   dominated by cooling demand, employing dispatched local photovoltaics
   and tri-generation could cover even beyond 30\% of all energy demand and
   lead to major carbon emission reductions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Quantum key distribution (QKD) uniquely allows the distribution of
   cryptographic keys with security verified by quantum mechanical limits.
   Both protocol execution and subsequent applications require the
   assistance of classical data communication channels. While using
   separate fibers is one option, it is economically more viable if data
   and quantum signals are simultaneously transmitted through a single
   fiber. However, noise-photon contamination arising from the intense data
   signal has severely restricted both the QKD distances and secure key
   rates. Here, we exploit a novel temporal-filtering effect for
   noise-photon rejection. This allows high-bit-rate QKD over fibers up to
   90 km in length and populated with error-free bidirectional Gb/s data
   communications. With a high-bit rate and range sufficient for important
   information infrastructures, such as smart cities and 10-Gbit Ethernet,
   QKD is a significant step closer toward wide-scale deployment in fiber
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is to investigate the potential of diminishing
   the energy consumed by typical low thermal mass office buildings for
   heating, cooling and lighting by using smart windows. The windows
   considered consisted of a double pane glazing unit in which a
   controllable absorbing layer is added on the interior surface of the
   exterior glass pane. This absorbing layer allows to change the optical
   properties of the window, resulting in a direct potential of control of
   the incident solar heat flux entering the building through the windows.
   A corresponding numerical model is developed showing that optimizing the
   solar heat flux absorption rate of the absorbing layer in regard of the
   necessary heating, cooling and lighting needs helps reducing
   significantly the total yearly energy consumption, and cooling peak
   loads. The simulations were done considering a building located in

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the large and small districts are proposing a new city model,
   called ``the smart city{''}, which represents a community of average
   technology size, interconnected and sustainable, comfortable, attractive
   and secure. The landscape requirements and the solutions to local
   problems are the critical factors. The cities consume 75\% of worldwide
   energy production and generate 80\% of CO2 emissions. Thus, a
   sustainable urban model, ``the smart city{''}, is sustained by the
   European Commission. In this paper, a model for computing ``the smart
   city{''} indices is proposed. The chosen indicators are not homogeneous,
   and contain high amount of information. The paper deals with the
   computation of assigned weights for the considered indicators. The
   proposed approach uses a procedure based on fuzzy logic and defines a
   model that allows us to estimate ``the smart city{''}, in order to
   access European funding. The proposed innovative system results in a
   more extended comprehension and simple use. Thus, the model could help
   in policy making process as starting point of discussion between
   stakeholders, as well as citizens in final decision of adoption measures
   and best evaluated options. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Here we sketch the rudiments of what constitutes a smart city which we
   define as a city in which ICT is merged with traditional
   infrastructures, coordinated and integrated using new digital
   technologies. We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which
   concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and
   feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for
   using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new
   technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms
   of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems
   relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk,
   uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research
   challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their
   operational functioning and planning through management, control and
   optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for
   innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform
   future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and
   realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that
   ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic
   city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and
   access to opportunities for urban populations. We begin by defining the
   state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six
   scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities
   regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech
   cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of
   urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new
   urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile
   forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed:
   Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the
   Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and
   Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic
   Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and
   Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory
   Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City. Finally we
   anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in this research and
   define a series of key demonstrators which we believe are important to
   progressing a science of smart cities.}},

   Multivariate regression analysis is applied to a dataset extracted from

   distance are also applicable to extreme commute distance. However, land
   use factors are more instrumental when explaining extreme commute
   distance. The results suggest that sex, age, occupation type, mode of

   concentration at the place of residence of the worker all explain
   commute distance. The results from the mixed land use variables shed
   some light on the importance of smart growth in limiting long commutes.

Abstract = {{Large-scale renewable electricity schemes (RES) for urban areas are
   investigated here with emphasis on RES integration and interfacing with
   the energy system to limit the outflow of RES electricity outside the
   city boundaries. Different electricity-to-thermal energy strategies to
   supply also heating and cooling demands were investigated to enable
   higher than usual RES shares through converting surplus renewable
   electricity into thermal energy which often constitute a major part of
   the end-use energy in a city. Case examples from a southern climate
   (Shanghai) with distributed PV schemes and a northern city (Helsinki)
   with off-shore seaside wind power were analyzed. The results from the
   Shanghai case indicate that when using thermal storage options,
   2-folding of the PV capacity from the self-use limit of PV could be
   possible. With optimal electricity-to-thermal energy strategies and
   energy management, a 40-65\% solar fraction of yearly electricity could
   be possible. In the Helsinki climate with wind power coinciding with the
   seasonal load peak, RES may satisfy beyond 30\% of all energy and beyond
   70\% of all electricity demand annually. The size of thermal storage
   needed in the above cases is between 10 and 100 GW h. A higher RES use
   leads to higher spatial power flows and power variability in the city
   which requires more sophisticated control strategies and flexible
   auxiliary power options to handle transmission bottlenecks. (C) 2012

   Methods: Three neighbourhood designs were assessed: 1) core
   neighbourhoods developed before 1930 that follow a grid pattern, 2)
   fractured-grid pattern neighbourhoods that were developed between the
   1930s and mid-1960s, and 3) curvilinear-pattern neighbourhoods that were
   developed between the mid-1960s through to 1998. Children aged 10-14
   years (N=455; mean age 11.7 years), grouped by the neighbourhoods they
   resided in, had their physical activity and sedentary behaviour
   objectively measured by accelerometry for 7 days. ANCOVA and MANCOVA
   (multivariate analysis of covariance) models were used to assess group
   differences (p<0.05).
   Results: Group differences were apparent on weekdays but not on weekend
   days. When age, sex and family income had been controlled for, children
   living in fractured-grid neighbourhoods had, on average, 83 and 55 fewer
   accelerometer counts per minute on weekdays than the children in the
   core and curvilinear-pattern neighbourhoods, respectively. Further
   analyses showed that the children in the fractured-grid neighbourhoods
   accumulated 15 and 9 fewer minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical
   activity per day and had a greater time spent in sedentary behaviour (23
   and 17 minutes) than those in core and curvilinear-pattern
   neighbourhoods, respectively.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that in Saskatoon there is a relation
   between neighbourhood design and children's physical activity and
   sedentary behaviours. Further work is needed to tease out which features
   of the built environments have the greatest impact on these important
   lifestyle behaviours. This information, offered in the context of
   ongoing development of neighbourhoods, as we see in Saskatoon, is
   critical to an evidence-informed approach to urban development and
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates how to reduce, by appropriate urban design, air
   temperature at the street level and to improve pedestrian thermal
   conditions in summer. The case study is a street in Athens with low
   aspect ratio H/W (H: building height; W: street width), low trees canopy
   coverage level, and high traffic. Urban variables for design are trees
   canopy coverage area ratio, traffic load, walls surfaces albedo, and HI
   W. Their thermal effect is separately and altogether estimated by
   applying the microclimatic Green-MC model whereas thermal stress is
   assessed using the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) index. The
   studied day is relatively hot (36.5 degrees C at midday) with eight
   hours of heat stress (two and six hours of extreme and strong heat
   stress, respectively) at street level. Acceptable near-to-discomfort
   limits for local pedestrians are considered whereas PET classification
   heat stress levels are adjusted to local conditions by applying a
   correction equation to obtained PET values. Results show that the
   examined scenarios are associated with air temperature decrease and
   improvement of thermal comfort in the shade, especially during the day's
   hottest hours. The trees thermal effect is the dominant factor followed
   by the increase of H/W and of the walls surfaces albedo. All the studied
   design scenarios are found able to reduce the number of heat stress
   hours but the trees canopy coverage area ratio increase scenario was
   found by itself able to be associated only with moderate heat stress for
   local pedestrians. Alternative local smart controls for thermal comfort
   (SCAT) options are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Encouraging consumers to use less electricity through information is
   essential for sustainable use of energy and demand response is indeed a
   key component of the smart grids concept. The aim with this study is to
   understand differences between consumer categories and what this could
   mean e.g. to develop effective demand response measures. In-depth
   analyses of answers from a questionnaire sent out to 2000 households,
   contribute to a better understanding of Swedish households' energy
   related behavior. The households have been provided with a web-site
   enabling them to check their daily electricity consumption compared to
   previous months/years and even get advice and tips on how to reduce
   electricity consumption. The results show clear differences in the
   response rates from different type of residence, different income areas
   of the city and in the most preferred ways of receiving
   information-feedback. The web based feedback, provided by the local
   energy company, received more visits (and more frequently) from
   respondents living in houses than from apartments.
   The analysis of the answers raises questions about the effectiveness of
   using only one tool of providing energy consumption information to the
   customers (web-site, in this case) and stresses the importance of
   applying an individual approach to different energy users. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper has analyzed the case of Moushuni Island at Sundarban of 24
   Parganas South of West Bengal, India. The proposition is to find out the
   possibility of grid-connectivity of Isolated Remote Island which is
   under rural electrification scheme by hybrid renewable energies under
   Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission of India. In these rural
   electrification program, grid extension can be the best option if the
   grid is reliable, the rural community rather big and in proximity to the
   grid. In many circumstances, a strong case for mini-grids based on
   hybrid systems can be made. Scattered communities and isolated houses
   are well served by solar and small hydro (where available) or small wind
   energy systems. By feeding renewable electricity to the utility grid
   through the grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system, during time
   of peak demand, sufficient electrical loads can be shed to prevent
   turning on a coal or natural gas-fired plant and therefore save CO2
   emissions and potentially energy import costs, replacing fossil fuels.
   The Social, Economic, and Environmental Benefits can be achieved through
   this proposition. Also, the Grid Interactive Operation of SPV System at
   Moushuni Island is tested. Malda district of West Bengal, India is a
   vision towards smart-grid city towards sustainable future, where rural
   consumers can upgrade their quality of life through solar energy

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges of today's society is the need to fulfill at
   the same time the two sides of the dichotomy between the growing energy
   demand and the need to look after the environment. Smart Grids are one
   of the answers: intelligent energy grids which retrieve data about the
   environment through extensive sensor networks and react accordingly to
   optimize resource consumption. In order to do this, the Smart Grids need
   to understand the existing relationship between energy demand and a set
   of relevant climatic variables. All smart ``systems{''} (buildings,
   cities, homes, consumers, etc.) have the potential to employ their
   intelligence for self-adaptation to climate conditions. After
   introducing the Smart World, a global framework for the collaboration of
   these smart systems, this paper presents the relationship found at
   experimental level between a range of relevant weather variables and
   electric power demand patterns, presenting a case study using an
   agent-based system, and emphasizing the need to consider this
   relationship in certain Smart World (and specifically Smart Grid and

Abstract = {{Smart high-tech companies are characterized by knowledge intensity and
   open innovation, and even when these companies emerge in spatial
   clusters or in dense urban places, they may utilize knowledge networks
   on a global scale. There is, however, not much insight into the factors
   that shape global knowledge networks, the role of virtualization
   therein, and the impact of global knowledge sourcing on local
   connectedness. An attempt is made in this paper to fill these gaps in
   our understanding, using a selected sample of young high-tech companies
   in the Netherlands and rough set analysis to identify homogeneous
   categories in the highly differentiated young high-tech companies
   segment. The outcomes suggest coexistent use of both mainly local and
   mainly glottal knowledge networks in city-regions, and losing local
   connectedness by some of the globalized companies, particularly those
   involved in co-creation of products with global customers and those
   acting as learning partners of global multinational corporations.
   Factors counteracting the weakening of local connectedness are specific
   local knowledge relationships with a university or company of origin,
   and a strategy of developing local/regional customer markets. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The innovation revolution spurred by venture capitalists decades ago has
   created the conditions in which scale enables big companies to shift
   from shackling innovation to unleashing it. Three trends are behind this
   shift: (1) The ease of innovation and its decreasing cost mean that
   start-ups now face the same short-term pressures that have constrained
   innovation at large companies. (2) Taking a page from start-up strategy,
   large companies are embracing open innovation and integrating
   entrepreneurial behaviors with their existing capabilities. (3)
   Innovation increasingly involves creating business models that tap big
   companies' unique strengths. In this context, entrepreneurial
   individuals, whom the author calls ``catalysts,{''} are working with
   corporations' resources, scale, and growing agility to develop solutions
   to global challenges.
   Here are the stories of four corporate catalysts: Keyne Monson, at
   Medtronic, spurred the creation of a program called Healthy Heart for
   All, which seeks to bring pacemaker technology to hundreds of thousands
   of Indians who desperately need it. Yuri Jain, at Unilever, sought and
   found a scalable solution to purifying drinking water Pureit, a portable
   system that provides safe water at just half a cent per liter. Nick
   Musyoka, at Syngenta, devised a program called Uwezo (Swahili for
   `capability{''}), which uses the sachet distribution model to provide
   smallholding farmers with affordable, premeasured packages of
   crop-protection chemicals. Colin Harrison, at IBM, was instrumental in
   developing the company's Smarter Cities program, which offers bundled
   technological infrastructure and related services to help cities save
   money and improve lives.}},

Abstract = {{Hamilton's historical roots as an electric, industrial and
   transportation-oriented city provide it with a high potential for rapid
   transit, especially when combined with its growing population,
   developing economy, redeveloping downtown core and its plans for
   sustainable growth. This paper explores the health, environmental,
   social and economic impacts of light rail transit, a component of the
   City of Hamilton's rapid transit initiative. It performs a comparative
   analysis with other major North American cities that have successfully
   implemented this form of mass transit. The analysis concentrates on
   three main areas: urban development and land values, health and
   environmental impact and socio-economic factors. The results of the
   research on light rail transit (LRT) and its possible benefits indicate
   overwhelming support for the economic, health, environmental and social
   benefits of LRT, especially when compared to other forms of transit,
   including rapid bus and local transit schemes. According to the results,
   LRT in a medium sized, growing city such as Hamilton should be
   considered a viable and desirable transit option; a catalyst for transit
   oriented, high density, mixed use development; an economically sound
   investment opportunity, providing a return on investment to property
   owners, businesses and the municipality; and a catalyst for social
   change, improving the health, environment and connectivity of the

Abstract = {{In the context of increasing developments of home, building and city
   automation, Power Line Communication (PLC) networking is called for
   unprecedented usage, especially for energy efficiency improvement. Our
   view of the future building networking infrastructure places PLC as the
   central point. We point that while Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is
   necessary in the sensor and actuator networking infrastructure. PLC is
   mandatory for the smart-grid metering and command infrastructure. PLC
   will also serve the sensor/actuator infrastructure when the energy
   requirement of the probing system itself cannot be fulfilled by
   autonomous battery and harvesting based nodes. PLC may also provide the
   numerous bridges necessary to sustain a long lifetime (years) with the
   battery based WSN part of the infrastructure. This new role of PLC
   networking will be possible only if the interoperability between all
   media and technology is made possible. Thanks to the converging design
   of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) networking layers, we show that
   such a full inter-interoperability is already possible even in very tiny
   constrained networking devices. Moreover, the low power PLC technology
   used in our experiments will be able to provide this smart grid
   monitoring without impacting noticeably the overall energy balance of
   the monitored system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a proposal of an intelligent video surveillance

   Alarm detection is performed on the basis of parameters of the moving
   objects and their trajectories, and is performed using semantic
   reasoning and ontologies. This means that the system employs a
   high-level conceptual language easy to understand for human operators,
   capable of raising enriched alarms with descriptions of what is
   happening on the image, and to automate reactions to them such as
   alerting the appropriate emergency services using the Smart City safety

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous sensor network deployments, such as the ones found in Smart
   cities and Ambient intelligence applications, require constantly
   increasing high computational demands in order to process data and offer
   services to users. The nature of these applications imply the usage of
   data centers. Research has paid much attention to the energy consumption
   of the sensor nodes in WSNs infrastructures. However, supercomputing
   facilities are the ones presenting a higher economic and environmental
   impact due to their very high power consumption. The latter problem,
   however, has been disregarded in the field of smart environment
   services. This paper proposes an energy-minimization workload assignment
   technique, based on heterogeneity and application-awareness, that
   redistributes low-demand computational tasks from high-performance
   facilities to idle nodes with low and medium resources in the WSN
   infrastructure. These non-optimal allocation policies reduce the energy
   consumed by the whole infrastructure and the total execution time.}},

Abstract = {{In many ways, embedded computation-the increasingly common way of adding
   computers into everyday life and everyday artifacts-is a natural
   outgrowth of technology trends over the past two decades. Adding
   computation is an easy way to increase the range of affordances and
   capabilities of devices, adding the ability to sense, cooperate, and
   support extended work practices and leisure activities. However, as
   Norbert Streitz has illustrated throughout his career, just adding
   computation to systems does not guarantee a successful or useful merging
   of capabilities. As this special issue points out (and as Streitz has
   argued many times), ubiquitous/pervasive/ambient computation must be
   carefully designed, with particular attention paid to the multiple and
   overlapping domains of human interest (cognitive, social, collaborative,
   and architectural). It is only by designing such systems with an eye
   toward actual use patterns, with an eye toward the behaviors of people
   who would use, inhabit and move through work and play, data and
   artifacts, that a clear ``design for humans{''} trend become clear.}},

   react to them differently across the border between Oregon and
   Washington due to their different land use planning systems. The
   findings suggest that smart growth policies impact single- and

   developers exhibit strong spatial inertia in their location choice.}},

Abstract = {{Human population growth and associated sprawl has rapidly converted open
   lands to developed use and affected their distinctive ecological
   characteristics. Missouri reflects a full range of sprawl
   characteristics that include large metropolitan centers, which led
   growth in 1980s, and smaller metropolitan and rural areas, which led
   growth in 1990s. In order to study the historical patterns of sprawl,
   there is a need to quantitatively and geographically depict the extent
   and density of impervious surface for three time periods of 1980, 1990,
   and 2000 for the entire state of Missouri. We mapped impervious surface
   using Sub-pixel Classifier (TM), an add-on module of Erdas Imagine for
   the three time periods, where impervious surface growth was derived as
   the subtraction of impervious surface mapped from the different time
   periods. Accuracy assessment was performed by comparing satellite
   derived impervious surface images with ground-truth acquired from high
   resolution air photos. Results show that during 1980-2000, 129,853 ha of
   land were converted to impervious surface. Sprawl was prominent on urban
   fringe (within the urban boundaries) during 1980s with 23,674 ha of land
   converted to impervious surface compared to 22,918 ha in 1990s. There
   was a temporal shift in the rural landscapes (outside the urban
   boundaries) in the 1990s with 48,079 ha of land converted to impervious
   surface compared to 35,180 ha in 1980s. Major findings based on analysis
   of the impervious surface growth include: (i) new growth of impervious
   surfaces are concentrated on areas with 0.5-1.0\% road cover; (ii) most
   new growths are either inside or close to urban watersheds; and (iii)
   most new growths are either inside or close to counties with
   metropolitan cities. This research goes beyond the usual hot spots of
   metropolitan areas to include rural landscapes where negative impact was
   exerted to the ecosystem due to the low density development and larger
   affected areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Grid-connectivity of remote isolated islands-A proposition in Indian
   context}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper has analyzed the cases of Moushuni Island at Sundarban of 24
   Parganas South of West Bengal, India. The proposition is to find out the
   possibility of grid-connectivity of isolated remote islands which is
   under rural electrification scheme by hybrid renewable energies under
   Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission of India. In these rural
   electrification program, grid extension can be the best option if the
   grid is reliable, the rural community rather big and in proximity to the
   grid. In many circumstances, a strong case for mini-grids based on
   hybrid systems can be made. Scattered communities and isolated houses
   are well served by solar and small hydro (where available) or small wind
   energy systems. By feeding renewable electricity to the utility grid
   through grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system, during time of
   peak demand, sufficient electrical loads can be shed to prevent turning
   on a coal or natural gas-fired plant and therefore save CO2 emissions
   and potentially energy import costs, replacing fossil fuels. But there
   is a barrier for grid-connectivity for isolated island, which can be
   overcome by feed-in-tariff policy implementation for renewables. Also,
   feed-in-tariff for mini-grids is a promising approach for linking
   off-grid and grid-connected renewable energy support. Also, most
   intelligent controller for grid interactive operation of solar
   photovoltaic-wind-bio hybrid energy system at Moushuni Island is
   proposed. This intelligent controller will switch from various renewable
   resources like solar-wind-biomass through change over switch panel to
   find out optimized hybrid renewable energy system. Malda district of
   West Bengal, India is a vision towards smart-grid city towards
   sustainable future, where rural consumers can upgrade their quality of
   life through solar energy resource. This paper also illustrated the
   socio-economic and environmental benefits and social costing of adopting
   renewables future for India. Cost proposition for integrating
   distributed renewable energy sources-solar energy to electricity grid
   has been analyzed along with the feasibility studies for factors
   responsible for cost/unit reduction. The feasibility studies for social,
   economic, and environmental benefits of renewables have been discussed
   along with justifications for hybrid renewable vs stand
   alone-photovoltaic and other types of renewable energy systems along
   with the comparative analysis of economic costing of installation of
   various types of renewable energy systems. (C) 2012 American Institute

Abstract = {{To improve our understanding of indoor and outdoor personal exposures to
   common environmental toxicants released into the environment, new
   technologies that can monitor and quantify the toxicants anytime

   concentration at a personal level in real-time, providing environmental
   toxicants data every three minutes. The sensor has high specificity and
   sensitivity to aromatic, alkyl, and chlorinated hydrocarbons with a
   resolution as low as 4 parts-per-billion (ppb), with a detection range
   of 4 ppb-1000 ppm (parts-per-million). The sensor's performance was
   validated using Gas Chromatography and Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass
   Spectrometry reference methods in a variety of environments and
   activities with overall accuracy higher than 81\% (r(2) > 0.9). Field
   tests examined personal exposure in various scenarios including: indoor
   and outdoor environments, traffic exposure in different cities which
   vary from 0 to 50 ppmC (part-per-million carbon from hydrocarbons), and
   pollutants near the 2010 Deepwater Horizon's oil spill. These field

Title = {{Sustainable Urban Regeneration Based on Energy Balance}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1488-1509}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, results are reported of a technology assessment of the
   use and integration of decentralized energy systems and storage devices
   in an urban renewal area. First the general context of a different
   approach based on `rethinking' and the incorporation of ongoing
   integration of coming economical and environmental interests on
   infrastructure, in relation to the sustainable urban development and
   regeneration from the perspective of the tripod people, technology and
   design is elaborated. However, this is at different scales, starting
   mainly from the perspective of the urban dynamics. This approach
   includes a renewed look at the `urban metabolism' and the role of
   environmental technology, urban ecology and environment behavior focus.
   Second, the potential benefits of strategic and balanced introduction
   and use of decentralized devices and electric vehicles (EVs), and
   attached generation based on renewables are investigated in more detail
   in the case study of the `Merwe-Vierhaven' area (MW4) in the Rotterdam
   city port in the Netherlands. In order to optimize the energy balance of
   this urban renewal area, it is found to be impossible to do this by
   tuning the energy consumption. It is more effective to change the energy
   mix and related infrastructures. However, the problem in existing urban
   areas is that often these areas are restricted to a few energy sources
   due to lack of available space for integration. Besides this, energy
   consumption in most cases is relatively concentrated in (existing) urban
   areas. This limits the potential of sustainable urban regeneration based
   on decentralized systems, because there is no balanced choice regarding
   the energy mix based on renewables and system optimization. Possible
   solutions to obtain a balanced energy profile can come from either the
   choice to not provide all energy locally, or by adding different types
   of storage devices to the systems. The use of energy balance based on
   renewables as a guiding principle, as elaborated in the MW4 case study,
   is a new approach in the field. It may enhance existing communities, and
   in some cases result in both the saving and demolition of parts of
   neighborhoods, which were not foreseen, while at the same time direct
   introduction of flexible appliances within the energy system for
   (temporary) storage. It is concluded that the best achievable energy
   balance in the MW4 area consists of an elaboration in which a smart grid
   is able to shift the load of flexible devices and charge EVs via smart
   charging while energy generation is based upon the renewables biomass,
   wind, tides and the sun. The introduction of new sustainable
   technologies makes a protected environment for development evident. As
   for system configuration, the choices arise mainly from technical and
   social optimisation. In fact, the social, or user-related criteria will
   be decisive for enduring sustainability.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous smart environments and anywhere anytime Internet availability
   are pushing to the extreme demand for effective and standardized
   integration solutions in the Future Internet. Standardization efforts of
   extreme industrial relevance, such as the IF Multimedia Subsystem (IMS),
   have recently emerged to support session control and interoperability in
   all-IP next generation networks. At the same time, recent advances in
   wireless communications have motivated the development of Wireless
   Sensor Networks (WSNs) for low-cost and easy-deployable environmental
   monitoring. However, the IMS potential for new classes of ready-to-use,
   energy-efficient, and highly integrated services, including also WSNs,
   is still widely unexplored. The paper proposes an original solution to
   opportunistically use client devices, that roam in geographically sparse
   environments (such as a smart city), as WSN data harvesters. The primary
   design guideline is to exploit IMS and the recently released IMS
   presence service to effectively coordinate harvesters, by saving energy
   via minimization of unnecessary communications. The reported
   experimental results point out that our solution, compliant with
   standards and thus easily deployable, can significantly increase sensor
   battery lifetime with minimum impact on the freshness of harvested data.

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to determine the degree to which

   general, been successfully tethered to sewer infrastructure. However,
   since passage of Maryland's PFA law, development that utilizes septic
   tanks has grown significantly and, in some cases, growth has occurred
   inside PFAs generally when there is a lack of existing sewer services.
   The proliferation of septic systems is a concern because it encourages
   low-density sprawl-like development, and has negative environmental

Abstract = {{In terms of the examination of the relationship between masculinity and
   health, there has been limited exploration of how the ways in which
   formerly incarcerated Latino men (FILM) construct their masculinities
   may conflict with public health messages. Using information gained from
   three years of ethnographic research that was conducted with formerly
   incarcerated Puerto Rican males in three urban communities in New York
   City, the authors examine what matters to FILM in terms of their health
   and well-being and what conflicts exist between public health prevention
   messages and FILM masculinity. Our results indicate the following: 1)
   major threats to the health of FILM, such as HIV risk behavior, alcohol
   and drug use and high caloric intake, are perceived as irrelevant to
   most of the FILM in the study; 2) young FILM believe that they engage in
   risky behaviors because of their ``knucklehead{''} mentality and
   diminish their risks by becoming ``street-smart;{''} and 3) social
   isolation, loneliness and general risk-taking behavior among FILM are
   salient issues that have yet to be effectively addressed. Of our sample
   of 32 FILM, we identified 7 individuals who have transitioned from
   having a ``knucklehead{''} approach in their lives to possessing a
   greater sense of awareness of health and social matters. These seven
   individuals followed either or both of the following pathways: 1)
   pursuing a college education or 2) becoming community leaders. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Solar energy is a regenerative and clean source of energy. In Makkah
   city (21.4 degrees N), the solar radiation is relatively high along the
   year; it is more than 5 KWh/m(2) a day and it is high enough to be
   efficiently used. On the other hand, due to high pollution and traffic
   in ``MASHAER{''} region in Makkah where pilgrimage is developed, a solar
   vehicle can be considered as smart solution for these problems.
   Therefore, a gasoline engine is replaced by an electrical drive motor in
   an old (second hand) vehicle, cargo car. The energy required for this
   motor is converted from the solar energy to electric power through the
   installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules those produce energy by
   absorbing incoming sunlight. Then it is stored in batteries that feed
   the motor by needed energy. Therefore, the vehicle transmission
   mechanism includes electrical motor with variable speed controller that
   rotates the vehicle wheels by a chain drive. A simple brake system is
   installed to control the vehicle speed. The size of photovoltaic cells
   is determined based on the motor power and volt. It is found that 4 m(2)
   PV panel area is enough to feed the car by needed power. Moreover, 6
   batteries are seemed enough to move the car for about 6 h daily. The
   vehicle is efficiently tested carrying six passengers for about 8 h
   continuously working under different operating and weather conditions.
   Moreover, a numerical simulation was developed for the solar vehicle
   system to visualize the annual performance of the system. A mathematical
   model of the photovoltaic cells, batteries, and controller were
   established. Annual measured data of Makkah city is used as input
   parameters to the numerical simulation. The system efficiency is
   investigated along the year demonstrating a successful utilization of
   solar energy in that sector. It is found that the considered PV array
   can move the vehicle for less than 2 h a day in average. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper explores the connections between economic development and
   sustainable land-use planning. It brings forward the idea that for
   cities to adapt their development patterns from low-density urban
   sprawl, they must plan and develop with efforts coordinated between
   economic development and land-use planning. It uses the example of the
   high-tech sector to determine what aspects are needed to create areas
   that are both attractive to high-tech firms while also matching the
   principles of smart growth, a popular method of sustainable urban
   development. It analyzes two case-study areas in Metro Vancouver:
   Yaletown, a dense neighbourhood in downtown Vancouver; and Crestwood
   Corporate Centre, a traditional office park in Richmond. Through these
   case studies the important factors needed to attract high-tech firms are
   determined, and connections with aspects of smart growth are
   articulated. It is argued that economic development and forms of
   sustainable urban development such as smart growth have positive
   connections and mutually beneficial results when coordinated.}},

Abstract = {{Urban sprawl is one of the major issues regarding sustainable urban
   development. In response to concerns about sprawl, compact development
   strategies have been proposed to promote sustainable development.
   However, a compact development approach needs to pay attention to the
   crucial question of commercial profitability. The aim of this article is
   to inquire into the commercial profitability of compact development
   strategies by developing different scenarios and to put forward ways to
   control urban sprawl through certain spatial strategies in the Istanbul
   case. The results indicate that the current planning approach is not
   effective in reducing sprawl without setting certain spatial strategies
   by which development activity is restricted, or imposing additional
   requirements for new development in certain areas. It is found that
   urban sprawl can be reduced by up to 62 per cent through setting certain
   spatial strategies and that uncontrolled urban sprawl might feasibly be
   shifted from peripheral to central areas.}},

Abstract = {{Peri-urban areas are sites currently experiencing the most active
   urbanization. In order to quantify the complexity in urban growth
   patterns and processes, based on the common boundary and Landscape
   Expansion Index (LEI) analysis, we developed six spatial rules to
   identify three urban growth types of infilling, edge-expansion and
   outlying in 2000-2008. In addition, growth density (GD) with buffer zone
   analysis was applied to ascertain urban movement from the city center.
   Results indicated the prominent urban growth type was edge-expansion,
   with continued urbanization most prominently in the peri-urban areas.
   The infilling growth increment proportion in the second study period
   (2004-2008) suggested the study area was experiencing an increased
   coalescence pattern and declined diffusion pattern. However, the highest
   infilling GD zones that occurred primarily near the city center did not
   vary significantly in 2000-2008. The intensive urban growth zones in the
   first study period (2000-2004) followed by later efficient infill growth
   also suggested urban growth was more compact in the second study period.
   Furthermore, two land use change maps showed that substantial arable
   land was lost by urban growth in 2000-2008, and the establishment of
   industrial parks encroached on large salt marsh in the second study
   period. Further research is required to delineate a suitable development
   management plan to sustain a baseline for urban growth. Furthermore, the
   integration of a zoning approach associated with the green belt is
   suggested to play a key role in a transition to continued urbanization.

Abstract = {{In this study, we present an indexing scheme to screen large numbers of
   brownfield sites in wide areas (municipalities, counties, states or
   other types of districts) in order to develop initial planning
   strategies for fund allocation and redevelopment. The scheme entails
   three dimensions, socioeconomic, smart growth and environmental, for
   each of which an index is constructed on the basis of location-specific
   variables irrespective of the target end use. Socioeconomic variables
   include population density, property values and unemployment which
   collectively represent the potential contribution of brownfield
   redevelopment to economic growth. The smart growth or livability index
   was developed on the basis of the LEED ND evaluation scheme of the U.S.
   Green Building Council, isolating location-specific features. Finally,
   the environmental index incorporates variables that represent the
   potential source of contamination (past use), pathway of exposure (soil
   permeability) and receptors (zoning, proximity to water bodies, parks,
   critical habitats, open spaces, wetlands and floodplains). The
   application of the indices to the City of New Haven, Connecticut as a
   case study yielded four priority sites out of 47 in the city inventory.
   Even though the indices were sensitive to the chosen weights,
   prioritization of sites in clusters reduced the effect; the top four
   sites were identical in the case study and 31 out of 47 sites were
   present in the same cluster regardless of the weighting scheme. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Sharing data from various sources and of diverse kinds, and fusing them
   together for sophisticated analytics and mash-up applications are
   emerging trends, and are prerequisites for realizing grand visions such
   as that of cyber-physical systems enabled smart cities. Cloud
   infrastructure can enable such data sharing both because it can scale
   easily to an arbitrary volume of data and computation needs on demand,
   as well as because of natural collocation of diverse such data sets
   within the infrastructure. However, in order to convince data owners
   that their data are well protected while being shared among cloud users,
   the cloud platform needs to provide flexible mechanisms for the users to
   express the constraints (access rules) subject to which the data should
   be shared, and likewise, enforce them effectively. We study a
   comprehensive set of practical scenarios where data sharing needs to be
   enforced by methods such as aggregation, windowed frame, value
   constrains, etc., and observe that existing basic access control
   mechanisms do not provide adequate flexibility to support effective data
   sharing in a secure and controlled manner. In this paper, we thus
   propose a framework for cloud that extends popular XACML model
   significantly by integrating flexible access control decisions and data
   access in a seamless fashion. We have prototyped the framework and
   deployed it on commercial cloud environment for experimental runs to
   test the efficacy of our approach and evaluate the performance of the
   implemented prototype.}},

Abstract = {{U-Eco City is a research and development project initiated by the Korean
   government. The project's objective is the monitoring and visualization
   of aggregated and real time states of various energy usages represented
   by location-based sensor data accrued from city to building scale. The
   platform's middleware will retrieve geospatial data from a GIS database
   and sensor data from the individual sensory installed over the city and
   provide the browser-based client with the accommodated information
   suitable to display geo-location characteristics specific to the
   respective energy usage. The client will be capable of processing and
   displaying real time and aggregated data in different dimensions such as
   time, location, level of detail, mode of visualization, etc. The
   platform's middleware has been developed into an operative, advanced
   prototype, providing information to a Web-based client that integrates
   and interfaces with the Google Earth and Google Maps plug-ins for
   geospatially referenced energy usage visualization and monitoring. (C)

   reducing institutions to their stylized forms ignores the real politics
   associated with institutional formation and outcome. A more fruitful
   approach, we suggest, is to draw upon recent work on institutions and
   institutional change. In particular the article utilizes a decentered
   institutional analysis put forth by political scientists Mark Bevir and

Title = {{Intelligent control of vehicle to grid power}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{201}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) describes a system ill which plug-in electric
   vehicles (PEV), which includes all electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid
   electric vehicles, utilize power by plugging into an electric power
   source and stored in rechargeable battery packs. PEVs significantly
   increase the load on the grid, much more than you would see in a typical
   household. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the use of
   intelligent solutions for monitoring and controlling the electrical grid
   when connected to and recharging PEV batteries. In order to achieve this
   aim, the study examines the distribution of electricity in the power
   grid of a large-scale city so that PEVs can tap into the system using
   smart grid electricity. The electricity grid for the large-scale city is
   modelled, and it can be shown that the vehicle electrification can play
   a major role in helping to stabilize voltage and load. This developed
   grid model includes 33 buses, 10 generators, 3 reactors, 6 capacitors,
   and 33 consumer centers. In addition, the grid model proposes 10 parking
   servicing 150,000 vehicles per day. The smart grid model uses
   intelligent controllers. Two intelligent controllers including (i) fuzzy
   load controllers and (ii) fuzzy voltage controllers have been used in
   this study to optimize the grid stability of load and voltage. The
   results show that the smart grid model can respond to any load
   disturbance in less time, with increased efficiency and improved
   reliability compared to the traditional grid. In conclusion it is
   emphasized that smart grid electricity should contribute to PEVs
   accessing renewable energy. Although the V2G will play a major role in
   the future portfolio of vehicle technologies, but does not make much
   sense if the carbon content of the electricity generated by the grid
   will not be reduced. Thus, the recourse to renewable energy and other
   alternatives is crucial. The energy is stored in electrochemical power
   sources (such as battery, fuel cells, supercapacitors,
   photoelectrochemical) when generated and then delivered to the grid
   during peak demand times. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), stability of the
   electric grid becomes a challenging task. A greater penetration level
   would demand a proper coordination amongst the various EVs as they
   charge or discharge to the grid. Coordination here refers to controlling
   the charging and discharging patterns of different EVs depending on
   their individual battery states and the present grid condition.
   Therefore, a good coordination between EVs is required for making the
   grid stable. With high penetration of EVs, the vehicle to grid (V2G)
   concept can be explored where excess energy of the battery can be
   supplied back to the grid in controlled fashion. Discharging EVs'
   battery energy to the grid in coordination can make V2G utilization as
   distributed energy storage. Charging EVs in coordination can flatten the
   voltage profile of a distribution node. In this work, a typical
   distribution system of a city is modeled to demonstrate V2G capabilities
   such as meeting peak demand and voltage sag reduction. The simulation of
   the distribution system with V2G capabilities are tested using fuzzy
   logic controller (FLC). Two controllers have been developed, namely the
   charging station controller and the V2G controller. Together they decide
   the proper energy flow between the EVs and the grid. Energy discharge to
   the grid from EVs or energy required for charging EVs is controlled and
   tested for the real time scenario.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Advances in communication technology may affect networking
   pattern, thereby influencing the dynamics of sex partnership. The aim of
   the study is to explore the impacts of partner sourcing through internet
   and related channels on exposure risk to sexually transmitted infections
   (STI) including HIV.
   Methods: Using venue-based sampling, a cross-sectional questionnaire
   survey was conducted at saunas frequented by men having sex with men
   (MSM) in Hong Kong. Comparison was made between MSM sourcing partners
   through physical venues alone versus concomitant users of physical and
   virtual channels, the latter referring to internet and smart-phone
   applications, using bivariate logistic regression.
   Results: Over a 7-week study period, 299 MSM were recruited from 9
   saunas. Three main types of sex partners were distinguished: steady
   (46.8\%), regular (26.4\%) and casual (96.0\%) partners. Users of sauna
   (n = 78) were compared with concomitant users of saunas and virtual
   channels (n = 179) for partner sourcing. Sauna-visiting virtual channel
   users were younger and inclined to use selected physical venues for
   sourcing partners. Smart-phone users ( n = 90) were not different from
   other internet-users in terms of age, education level and single/mixed
   self-identified body appearance. Classifying respondents into high risk
   and low risk MSM by their frequency of condom use, concomitant use of
   both sauna and virtual channels accounted for a higher proportion in the
   high risk category (71.6\% vs. 58.2\%, OR = 1.81, p<0.05). In virtual
   channel users, partner sourcing through smart-phone was not associated
   with a higher practice of unprotected sex.
   Conclusion: MSM sauna customers commonly use virtual channels for sex
   partner sourcing. Unprotected sex is more prevalent in sauna customers
   who use virtual channel for sex partner sourcing. While the popularity
   of smart-phone is rising, its use is not associated with increased
   behavioural risk for HIV/STI transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends
   (SMART) follows trends in resistance among aerobic and facultative
   anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from complicated
   Ultra-abdominal infections (cIAls) in patients around the world.
   Methods: During 2004-2009, three centralized clinical microbiology
   laboratories serving 59 private hospitals in three large South African
   cities collected 1,218 GNB from complicated intra-abdominal infections
   (clAls) and tested them for susceptibility to 12 antibiotics according
   to the 2011 Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.
   Results: Enterobacteriaceae comprised 83.7\% of the isolates.
   Escherichia coli was the species isolated most commonly (46.4\%), and
   7.6\% of these were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive.
   The highest.ESBL rate was documented for Klebsiella pneumoniae (41.2\%).
   Overall, ertapenem was the antibiotic most active against susceptible
   species for which it has breakpoints (94.6\%) followed by amikacin
   (91.9\%), piperacillin-tazobactam (89.3\%), and imipenem-cilastatin
   (87.1\%), whereas rates of resistance to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime,
   ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin were documented to be 29.7\%, 28.7\%,
   22.5\%, and 21.1\%, respectively. Multi-drug resistance (MDR), defined
   as resistance to three or more antibiotic classes, was significantly
   more common in K. pneumoniae (27.9\%) than in E. colt (4.9\%; p <
   0.0001) or Proteus mimbilis (4.1\%; p < 0.05). Applying the new CLSI
   breakpoints for carbapenems, susceptibility to ertapenem was reduced
   significantly in ESBL-positive E. coli compared with ESBL-negative
   isolates (91\% vs. 98\%; p < 0.05), but this did not apply to
   imipenem-cilastatin (95\% vs. 99\%; p=0.0928). A large disparity between
   imipenem-cilastatin and ertapenem susceptibility in P. mirabilis and
   Morganella morganii was documented (24\% vs. 96\% and 15\% vs. 92\%,
   respectively), as most isolates of these two species had
   imipenem-cilastatin minimum inhibitory concentrations in the 2-4 mcg/mL
   range, which is no longer regarded as susceptible.
   Conclusions: This study documented substantial resistance to standard
   antimicrobial therapy among GNB commonly isolated from clAIs in South
   Africa. With the application of the new CLSI carbapenem breakpoints,
   discrepancies were noted between ertapenem and imipenem-cilastatin with
   regard to the changes in their individual susceptibilities. Longitudinal
   surveillance of susceptibility patterns is useful to guide
   recommendations for empiric antibiotic use in clAls.}},

Abstract = {{Power companies can benefit from the use of knowledge discovery methods
   and statistical machine learning for preventive maintenance. We
   introduce a general process for transforming historical electrical grid
   data into models that aim to predict the risk of failures for components
   and systems. These models can be used directly by power companies to
   assist with prioritization of maintenance and repair work. Specialized
   versions of this process are used to produce 1) feeder failure rankings,
   2) cable, joint, terminator, and transformer rankings, 3) feeder Mean
   Time Between Failure (MTBF) estimates, and 4) manhole events
   vulnerability rankings. The process in its most general form can handle
   diverse, noisy, sources that are historical (static), semi-real-time, or
   real-time, incorporates state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for
   prioritization (supervised ranking or MTBF), and includes an evaluation
   of results via cross-validation and blind test. Above and beyond the
   ranked lists and MTBF estimates are business management interfaces that
   allow the prediction capability to be integrated directly into corporate
   planning and decision support; such interfaces rely on several important
   properties of our general modeling approach: that machine learning
   features are meaningful to domain experts, that the processing of data
   is transparent, and that prediction results are accurate enough to
   support sound decision making. We discuss the challenges in working with
   historical electrical grid data that were not designed for predictive
   purposes. The ``rawness{''} of these data contrasts with the accuracy of
   the statistical models that can be obtained from the process; these
   models are sufficiently accurate to assist in maintaining New York
   City's electrical grid.}},

Title = {{Time of use tariffs: implications for water efficiency}},
Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{90-100}},
Abstract = {{Water utilities undertake long term planning for water source security,
   often with forecast cycles of 20-30 years. Whilst this planning is
   generally involved with investigations of source water abstraction
   security and the need to build dams or to increase the recharge rate of
   groundwater aquifers, planning for water efficiency gains occurs at
   annual intervals. Most water utilities in Australia are heavily engaged
   in water efficiency initiatives with rebate schemes for domestic
   water-efficient devices being ubiquitous across the industry. Wide Bay
   Water Corporation (WBWC) also engages in these activities but is
   increasingly interested in the concept of Time of Use Tariffs (TOUTs) to
   target high water users in order to reduce their demand on the system.
   In 2006, WBWC introduced smart metering technology across the city which
   captures hourly use data. Interrogation of this data has led to the
   ability to identify water use patterns for every domestic and commercial
   water customer and to design specific interventions to encourage water
   efficiency, such as a TOUT for domestic customers. A TOUT has been
   developed that imposes a penalty on all individual consumption greater
   than 600 L in any hourly interval of any day in the year. The tariff was
   designed to reduce both the annual peak hour and peak day demand. The
   ability to reduce both of these infrastructure design parameters may
   have the potential to deliver substantial savings in infrastructure
   planning and deployment. This paper details the design process of this
   tariff, examines the infrastructure savings potential derived by network
   modelling and explores the regulatory framework hurdles to be overcome
   in order to implement such tariffs in the water industry.}},

Pages = {{193-238}},
Abstract = {{Legal scholars have begun to treat the exclusion of residents of
   unincorporated urban areas from basic urban services such as sewer and
   clean water delivery as a distinct environmental injustice. Current law
   and historical practices of city governments have thrown these
   communities, many of which are in California's Central Valley, into
   poverty and disenfranchisement, with little legal recourse.
   At the same time, activists fighting climate change are stymied at the
   international and national levels, with the 2009 Copenhagen conference
   and President Obama's campaign proposals leading nowhere. But lawyers
   have found a way to tie the California Environmental Quality Act to
   California's land use planning laws in a way that gives them leverage to
   impel local governments to enact climate action plans that employ the
   principles of smart growth.
   These two efforts on unincorporated urban areas and climate change can
   unite. As part of a highly collaborative process, lawyers and community
   residents can weave principles of fair growth, especially the provision
   of vital services to disadvantaged unincorporated areas, into the smart
   growth arguments. This will benefit both groups, each supplementing the
   other's political heft to enact their unified vision. This solution is
   only half legal in nature; the rest will call for deft grassroots
   organizing and institutional coalition-building. As such, it requires
   not a commentary, but a proposal, which is presented herein.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important challenges for urban designers and planners
   about the conditions of cities is changing cities main structure and
   initial form of some areas because of mismanagement, kinds of different
   pollutions and converting land uses or discharging them due to
   inhabitants' migration. In duration of time, they transform to
   problemable areas and free of residents. Unfortunately many residential
   areas are developed without any particular regard to their surroundings.
   This causes because of increasing reliability on cars (Biddulph, 2007,
   131). On the other hand builders typically only build houses, while
   other developers specialize in commercial schemes, and investors like
   the security of investing their money in single uses-rather than in
   mixed developments-thus maximizing their profits and planners often like
   to zone and therefore separate, different types of uses so that
   conflicts of amenity do not occur (the same) and a city doesn't have
   seen as an active and energetic open system that reforms itself in order
   to responding the surroundings condition. So for achieving a mixed use
   balance between different needs of users and beneficiaries we require to
   present the alternative that can satisfy all beneficiates and users also
   create desirable urban spaces. As a main problem of current cities and
   metropolises, is land leakage and its difficulties, one of the suitable
   options is a kind of using the space that encourages the commercial
   benefits and can be efficient in longer period of time. This spatial
   design pattern attains by mixed use theory

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{2297}},
Pages = {{38-46}},
Abstract = {{This study analyzes the effects of impact fees on urban form and
   congestion through econometric analysis. The results show that there is
   some evidence that impact fees might reduce congestion by creating
   disincentives to residential development and job creation. However,
   direct evidence of a negative effect of impact fees in development and
   job growth is not found. There is no evidence that the difference in
   impact fees between central cities and outer areas promotes a more
   compact urban form. Likewise, there is no evidence that more road impact
   fees decrease congestion through more investment in infrastructure. This
   finding might be because impact fees usually finance local roads but
   congestion is concentrated on freeways and arterials or because there is
   a spatial, temporal, or financial mismatch between the collection and
   investment of impact fees. There is a clear, significant, and
   substantial positive relationship between density and congestion; this
   relationship indicates a weak increase in transit use in denser
   environments or a potential increase in automotive travel through higher
   trip frequency. However, other urban form variables related to the
   distribution of that density have a negative effect on congestion,
   indicating that certain urban configurations could decrease congestion.
   Finally, changes in congestion are negatively correlated with the
   congestion levels at the beginning of the period; this finding suggests
   that congestion is increasing faster in those areas that used to be less
   congested.}},

Abstract = {{The present work deals with the optimization of an in-wheel surface
   mounted permanent magnet motor (SMPM) with outer rotor and concentrated
   windings. The main objective of the optimization procedure is to find
   the optimum design geometry by maximizing the machine efficiency and
   minimizing its weight. To reach this goal, two objective functions are
   used. The first leads to a design with high output torque capability and
   then high efficiency. The second is a requirement imposed by the fact
   that the machine is directly integrated inside the vehicle wheel, and
   therefore a light weight is requested. In order to carry out this study,
   five multi-objective optimization algorithms were applied: the Genetic
   Algorithm (GA), the fast elitist multi-objective Genetic Algorithm
   (NSGA-II), the Adapting Scatter Search for Multi-objective Optimization
   algorithm (AbYSS), the improved PSO-based Multi-Objective Optimization
   and a new PSO-based Metaheuristic for Multi-objective Optimization. The
   reason of testing several intelligence artificial techniques is to find
   a fast and efficient technique for electrical machines optimization.
   Based on the objective functions design and the machine constraints, the
   results obtained by the five algorithms are compared and analyzed. In
   order to carry out this study, an analytical model describing the
   geometric, the magnetic and the electric properties of the studied
   design was firstly developed. Moreover, an optimized machine is chosen
   and studied by means of finite element analysis (FEA) tool. Then FEA
   results are compared with those obtained by the optimization procedure.
   Based on this comparison, a good concordance between the two results is
   shown.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to introduce an intelligent E-Learning
   software system, which aims to improve students' motivations and

   based on an intelligent analysis approach, which is formed via an

   Optimization Algorithm. This intelligent approach tries to provide
   appropriate materials to students by evaluating learning levels. At this
   point, types of learning levels are defined by teachers and associated
   with specific abilities regarding to computer programming. After
   determining learning levels according to results of the performed
   activities, it is then possible for software system to provide
   appropriate materials/applications corresponding types of low learning
   levels. Thanks to the system, it is possible to learn abstract,
   difficult computer programming based subjects easily. In order to have
   idea about effectiveness of the system, it was evaluated in some

Abstract = {{Modern GPUs provide considerable computation power, often in the range
   of teraflops. By using open standards such as OpenCL, which provide an
   abstraction layer over the GPUs physical characteristics, these can be
   employed to solve general computation tasks. Massively parallel
   algorithms used in domains such as simulation, graphics, artificial
   intelligence can greatly expand their application range. It is of great
   importance for an application to run parts of itself on GPUs and in this
   respect a number of issues such as OpenCL code generation, data
   serialization and synchronization between application and GPU must be
   observed. At the same time, the GPU limitations impose some limits on
   their applicability to general computation tasks, so an application must
   carefully assess what parts are suitable for this kind of execution. The
   computing resources must be abstracted and when possible these should be
   interchangeable without modifying the source code. We present a new
   algorithm and library which dynamically generates OpenCL code at runtime
   for parts of its application in order to run these parts on GPU. Our
   library automatically handles tasks such as data serialization and
   synchronization. The practical results are significant and we succeeded
   in obtaining important speedups using only a straightforward Java
   implementation of the test algorithm, without any platform specific
   constructs.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of supercomputer technologies is traditionally related to
   mapping algorithms onto the computer architecture, which, taking into
   account the explosive growth of computational capabilities, implies the
   necessity for an adequate increase in the performance of algorithms and
   programs. At the same time, it is well known that the rate of building
   ``computer muscles{''} far exceeds the rate of increasing the labor
   productivity of software developers, which becomes a bottleneck of
   computer evolution. The only way to deal with this problem is to
   automate the construction of models, algorithms, and programs, which
   directly implies the revolutionary change in the level of artificial
   intelligence in supercomputer technologies. In this paper, it is from
   this standpoint that main computational stages of mathematical modeling
   of various processes and phenomena are discussed, some aspects of high
   logical complexity of modern high-performance methods for solving
   ``large{''} applied problems are pointed out, and some intelligent
   solutions for various modeling problems are proposed.}},

Title = {{The SP Theory of Intelligence: Distinctive Features and Advantages}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{216-246}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to highlight distinctive features of the SP theory of
   intelligence, realized in the SP computer model, and its apparent
   advantages compared with some AI-related alternatives. Perhaps most
   importantly, the theory simplifies and integrates observations and
   concepts in AI-related areas, and has potential to simplify and
   integrate of structures and processes in computing systems. Unlike most
   other AI-related theories, the SP theory is itself a theory of
   computing, which can be the basis for new architectures for computers.
   Fundamental in the theory is information compression via the matching
   and unification of patterns and, more specifically, via a concept of
   multiple alignment. The theory promotes transparency in the
   representation and processing of knowledge, and unsupervised learning of
   natural structures via information compression. It provides an
   interpretation of aspects of mathematics and an interpretation of
   phenomena in human perception and cognition. Abstract concepts in the
   theory may be realized in terms of neurons and their inter-connections
   (SP-neural). These features and advantages of the SP system are
   discussed in relation to AI-related alternatives: the concept of minimum
   length encoding and related concepts, how computational and energy
   efficiency in computing may be achieved, deep learning in neural
   networks, unified theories of cognition and related research, universal
   search, Bayesian networks and some other models for AI, IBM's Watson,
   solving problems associated with big data and in the development of
   intelligence in autonomous robots, pattern recognition and vision, the
   learning and processing of natural language, exact and inexact forms of
   reasoning, representation and processing of diverse forms of knowledge,
   and software engineering. In conclusion, the SP system can provide a
   firm foundation for the long-term development of AI and related areas,
   and at the same time, it may deliver useful results on relatively short
   timescales.}},

Title = {{An Intelligent Strategy for Tactical Movements of UAVs in Disaster
   Scenarios}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned as flexible and fast
   -deploying communication network for disaster scenarios, where the
   typical communication infrastructure is likely to be malfunctioning. A
   few works propose UAVs for building communication links autonomously
   between rescue team's members in disaster scenarios. The techniques used
   are usually based on navigation, positioning, and signal strength
   processing. However, these techniques may not be enough if the objective
   is to provide communication services to the maximum number of victims
   and rescuers and not only to a few rescuers. In this situation,
   dissimilarity metrics, like the Jaccard distance, can provide
   information about whether the conununication service provided to victims
   is efficient or not (e.g., providing a better distribution of the
   victims assigned to each UAV acting as service provider). We propose an
   intelligent strategy that allows UAVs to perform tactical movements in a
   disaster scenario, combining the Jaccard distance and artificial
   intelligence algorithms like hill climbing and simulated annealing. Our
   strategy maximizes the number of victims that are serviced by the UAVs
   while avoiding network disconnections. Also, a mobility model
   specifically developed for modelling the victims' movements within the
   incident site of a disaster scenario is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to all benefits of blasting in mining and civil engineering
   applications, it has some undesirable environmental impacts. Backbreak
   is an unwanted phenomenon of blasting which can cause instability of
   mine walls, decreasing efficiency of drilling, falling down of
   machinery, etc. Recently, the use of new approaches such as artificial
   intelligence (AI) is greatly recommended by many researchers. In this
   paper, a new AI technique namely genetic programing (GP) was developed
   to predict BB. To prepare a sufficient database, 175 blasting works were
   investigated in Sungun copper mine, Iran. In these operations, the most
   influential parameters on BB including burden, spacing, stemming length,
   powder factor and stiffness ratio were measured and used to develop BB
   predictive models. To demonstrate capability of GP technique, a
   non-linear multiple regression (NLMR) model was also employed for
   prediction of BB. Value account for (VAF), root mean square error (RMSE)
   and coefficient of determination (R-2) were used to control the capacity
   performance of the predictive models. The performance indices obtained
   by GP approach indicate the higher reliability of GP compared to NLMR
   model. RMSE and VAF values of 0.327 and 97.655, respectively, for
   testing datasets of GP approach reveal the superiority of this model in
   predicting BB, while these values were obtained as 0.865 and 81.816,
   respectively, for NLMR model.}},

Abstract = {{The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach has had been applied in
   solutions for several problems such as classification, prediction and
   pattern recognition. Mostly, these problems belong to diversified areas
   of knowledge, not necessarily related to Computer Science, e.g. in
   agriculture, specifically in precision agriculture, recognition of
   diseases in plants, among others. Therefore, it is possible to visualize
   the multidisciplinary feature that ANNs have, motivating the development
   of tools for simulating more generic ANN, making its use possible by
   users whose knowledge of this type of methodology isn't deep. Inside
   this context, the just described work has had the goal of developing a
   tool that is part of the BRNeural research project, whose main goal was
   the development of a simulator named BRNeural (Brasil Neural) which is
   focused on the scientific and professional community since one of its
   proposals is to offer a generic environment to aid the creation, train
   and operate with ANNs. This tool consists in a module for training and
   testing ANNs with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) topology and it was
   developed using the ENCOG framework. For validating this module and all
   implemented training algorithms, the simulator was submitted to pattern
   recognition tests using agrometeorological data such as temperature,
   relative humidity, solar radiation, atmospheric pressure, wind
   direction, wind speed and temperature of leaf wetness, comparing the
   results obtained with another simulator which was developed using the
   MLP framework (Medeiros, 2003) with the specific purpose of classifying
   diseases in severity indexes. After validating, the simulator was
   submitted to other pattern recognition tests whose goal was the
   classification of diseases in the wheat like Blight, Spot blotch and
   Mildew in severity indexes through agrometeorological variables, showing
   its features such as output normalizations and the training algorithms
   Backpropagation, Resilient propagation and Quick propagation. The best
   results were obtained with the tests for the classification of diseases
   using severity indexes, 83.63\% correct answers for Blight using the
   Quick propagation training algorithm and Equilateral normalization,
   86.95\% of correct answers for Mildew with Resilient Propagation
   algorithm and OneOf normalization and, for Spot blotch, 91.96\% correct
   answers with Quick and Resilient Propagation algorithms, both using
   Equilateral normalization.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Optimal feature subset selection is an important and a difficult task
   for pattern classification, data mining, and machine intelligence
   applications. The objective of the feature subset selection is to
   eliminate the irrelevant and noisy feature in order to select optimum
   feature subsets and increase accuracy. The large number of features in a
   dataset increases the computational complexity thus leading to
   performance degradation. In this paper, to overcome this problem, angle
   modulation technique is used to reduce feature subset selection problem
   to four-dimensional continuous optimization problem instead of
   presenting the problem as a high-dimensional bit vector. To present the
   effectiveness of the problem presentation with angle modulation and to
   determine the efficiency of the proposed method, six variants of
   Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithms employ angle modulation for
   feature selection. Experimental results on six high-dimensional datasets
   show that Angle Modulated ABC algorithms improved the classification
   accuracy with fewer feature subsets.}},

Journal = {{INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},

Pages = {{185-199}},
Abstract = {{A significant number of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence
   applications are based on descriptors that are extracted from segmented
   objects. One widely used class of such descriptors are the invariant
   moments, with Zernike moments being reported as some of the most
   efficient descriptors. The calculation of image moments requires the
   definition of distance and angle of any pixel from the centroid pixel of
   a specific object. While this is straightforward in images acquired by
   projective cameras, the classic definition of distance and angle may not
   be applicable to omni-directional images obtained by fish-eye cameras.
   In this work, we provide an efficient definition of distance and angle
   between pixels in omni-directional images, based on the calibration
   model of the acquisition camera. Thus, a more appropriate calculation of
   moment invariants from omnidirectional videos is achieved in time
   domain. A large dataset of synthetically generated binary silhouettes,
   as well as segmented human silhouettes from real indoor videos are used
   to assess experimentally the effectiveness of the proposed Zernike
   descriptors in recognising different poses in omni-directional video.
   Comparative numerical results between the traditional Zernike moments
   and the moments based on the proposed corrections of the Zernike
   polynomials are presented. Results from other state of the art image
   descriptors are also included. Results show that the proposed correction
   in the calculation of Zernike moments improves pose classification
   accuracy significantly. The computational complexity of the proposed
   implementation is also discussed.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a novel method based on the voice intensity of a speech
   signal is used for automatic pathology detection with continuous speech.
   The proposed method determines the peaks from the speech signal to form
   a voice contour. The area under the voice contour allows us to
   discriminate between normal and disordered subjects. In the case of
   disordered subjects, the calculated area under the voice contour is
   lower than that for a normal subject due to the malfunctioning of vocal
   folds, which makes the voice weaker and breathier. Some long-term
   features such as shimmer and jitter are based on the accurate estimation
   of fundamental frequency, which is itself a difficult task, especially
   for disordered speech signals. The proposed feature does not need to
   estimate the pitch period or fundamental frequency during the
   calculation of the voice contour and they provide a single value for the
   whole utterance similar to other long-term features. The voice disorder
   database used in this study includes 71 normal subjects and the same
   number of disordered subjects. Each disordered subject has one of the
   following voice disorders: vocal folds cysts, laryngopharyngeal reflux
   disease, vocal folds polyps, unilateral vocal folds paralysis and sulcus
   vocalic. The accuracy of the proposed method is 100\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimizer (CLPSO) is a
   state-of-the-art variant of PSO, which maintains the diversity of its
   swarm by learning from different exemplars on different dimensions.
   Preserving the swarm diversity enables CLPSO to address the premature
   convergence problem associated with the canonical PSO. In this paper,
   the performance of the recently proposed fuzzy-controlled CLPSO
   (FC-CLPSO) is investigated on 24 problems; five of them are real-world
   engineering problems and six high-dimensional problems. In addition, two
   new CLPSO variants inspired by the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm
   are proposed, CLPSO-ABC and FC-CLSPO-ABC. These two methods are compared
   with CLPSO and FC-CLPSO. The results show that FC-CLPSO-ABC outperforms
   the other three methods. FC-CLSPO-ABC is then compared with three other
   state-of-the-art swarm intelligence approaches on 24 problems. The
   results show that FC-CLPSO-ABC generally outperforms the other
   approaches.}},

Title = {{Three-dimensional imputation of missing monthly river flow data}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIA IRANICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-53}},
Abstract = {{Imputation of missing data is a critical part of accurate data analysis
   and modeling. This paper presents 3D imputation as a new data-driven
   methodology to estimate missing values in time series data. The method
   is based on the assumption that all the observed data in a time series
   are related with each other and with data of the some other series. The
   available data is placed in a three-dimensional space so that the
   increasing or decreasing relationships between the observed data are
   appropriately represented. For the estimation of each missing value, the
   method searches and determines the best possible group of estimator data
   within the data space. Different data groups are found and used for the
   estimations of each individual group of missing data. The method is
   validated by removing and estimating all the observed monthly flow data
   of Saraykoy station on Buyuk Menderes River in Turkey. Data of the
   downstream Burhaniye station constituted the second data layer in the
   model. High correlation values were obtained for all years between
   observations and estimations and the missing data of Saraykoy station
   was also estimated by using the proposed method. (C) 2016 Sharif

Journal = {{SCIENTIA IRANICA}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{102-113}},
Abstract = {{This research introduces an approach to predict maximum scour depth,
   scour hole length, and the length of the deepest point of the scour hole
   at equilibrium conditions at downstream of stilling basins by using the
   GEP. Five non-dimensional parameters in terms of physical properties of
   bed sediments, stilling basin length, tail water depth, and discharge of
   spillway were considered as input variables to evaluate the scour hole
   geometry. The GEP model was developed using experimental datasets
   collected from literature. Results of the GEP models were compared with
   those obtained using ANFIS and non-linear regression analysis.
   Performances indicated that the proposed GEP models to characterize
   scour hole geometry produced more accurate results than the other
   methods. In addition, results of sensitivity analysis to define the most
   effective independent parameters on scour hole geometry were reported.
   Finally, proper application of the proposed model has been confirmed as
   the GEP-based best formulation, which is a useful soft computing tool
   for prediction of scour hole geometry at downstream of a stilling basin.

Abstract = {{This paper reports a novel optimization strategy combined with
   artificial intelligence for parameters and location design of precision
   equipment and provides a broader view for traditional passive vibration
   isolation. It also considers ``precision equipment-vibration
   isolators-thin plate foundation{''} as a composite passive vibration
   isolation system and the clamped thin plate. The vibration isolation
   system is considered as four-point support, and the displacement
   amplitude transmissibility from the thin plate to precision equipment is
   derived and based on the analysis of influencing factors of
   transmissibility; subsequently, multi-objective optimization of the
   composite system is performed. A novel swarm intelligence
   multi-objective optimization method-a multi-objective particle swarm
   optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is adopted in this paper which can
   achieve a global optimal solution and by selecting the desired solution
   from an equivalence relation, the whole Pareto set can be avoided. The
   maximum and variance of the four transmitted peak displacements are
   simultaneously considered as fitness functions, and the purpose is to
   reduce the amplitude of the multi-peak isolation system, and in the
   meantime, to allow the plate to be uniformly vibrated as far as
   possible. Moreover, the presented idea is validated numerically, and the
   location research of the precision equipment mounted on the plate is
   also conducted.}},

   motivation for this special issue and summarize the contributions of the
   papers that have been included. The selected papers cover a broad range
   of cross-lingual technologies including machine translation, domain and
   language adaptation for sentiment analysis, cross-language lexical

Title = {{Improving Accuracy and Simplifying Training in Fingerprinting-Based
   Indoor Location Algorithms at Room Level}},
Journal = {{MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Fingerprinting-based algorithms are popular in indoor location systems
   based on mobile devices. Comparing the RSSI (Received Signal Strength
   Indicator) from different radio wave transmitters, such as Wi-Fi access
   points, with prerecorded fingerprints from located points (using
   different artificial intelligence algorithms), fingerprinting-based
   systems can locate unknown points with a few meters resolution. However,
   training the system with already located fingerprints tends to be an
   expensive task both in time and in resources, especially if large areas
   are to be considered. Moreover, the decision algorithms tend to be of
   high memory and CPU consuming in such cases and so does the required
   time for obtaining the estimated location for a new fingerprint. In this
   paper, we study, propose, and validate a way to select the locations for
   the training fingerprints which reduces the amount of required points
   while improving the accuracy of the algorithms when locating points at
   room level resolution. We present a comparison of different artificial
   intelligence decision algorithms and select those with better results.
   We do a comparison with other systems in the literature and draw
   conclusions about the improvements obtained in our proposal. Moreover,
   some techniques such as filtering nonstable access points for improving
   accuracy are introduced, studied, and validated.}},

   framework for decision support for CPS. It enables the development of
   determinate, provable and executable CPS models supported by sound
   semantics strengthening the model-driven approach to CPS design. An
   investigation into the structure of basic description logics (DL) has
   identified the needed semantic extensions to enable the web ontology
   language (OWL) as the ontological language for our framework. The SROIQ
   DL has been found to be the most appropriate logic-based knowledge
   formalism as it maps to OWL 2 and ensures its decidability. Thus,
   correct, stable, complete and terminating reasoning algorithms are
   guaranteed with this SROIQ-backed language. The framework takes
   advantage of the commonality of data and information processing in the
   different domains involved to overcome the barrier of heterogeneity of
   domains and physics in CPS. Rules-based reasoning processes are
   employed. The framework provides interfaces for semantic extensions and
   computational support, including the ability to handle quantities for
   which dimensions and units are semantic parameters in the physical
   world. Together, these capabilities enable the conversion of data to
   knowledge and their effective use for efficient decision making and the
   study of system-level properties, especially safety. We exercise these
   concepts in a traffic light time-based reasoning system. (C) 2016

Title = {{Hybrid Swarm Intelligence Energy Efficient Clustered Routing Algorithm
   for Wireless Sensor Networks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Currently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used in many
   applications, namely, environment monitoring, disaster management,
   industrial automation, and medical electronics. Sensor nodes carry many
   limitations like low battery life, small memory space, and limited
   computing capability. To create a wireless sensor network more energy
   efficient, swarm intelligence technique has been applied to resolve many
   optimization issues in WSNs. In many existing clustering techniques an
   artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is utilized to collect information
   from the field periodically. Nevertheless, in the event based
   applications, an ant colony optimization (ACO) is a good solution to
   enhance the network lifespan. In this paper, we combine both algorithms
   (i.e., ABC and ACO) and propose a new hybrid ABCACO algorithm to solve a
   Nondeterministic Polynomial (NP) hard and finite problem of WSNs. ABCACO
   algorithm is divided into three main parts: (i) selection of optimal
   number of subregions and further subregion parts, (ii) cluster head
   selection using ABC algorithm, and (iii) efficient data transmission
   using ACO algorithm. We use a hierarchical clustering technique for data
   transmission; the data is transmitted from member nodes to the
   subcluster heads and then from subcluster heads to the elected cluster
   heads based on some threshold value. Cluster heads use an ACO algorithm
   to discover the best route for data transmission to the base station
   (BS). The proposed approach is very useful in designing the framework
   for forest fire detection and monitoring. The simulation results show
   that the ABCACO algorithm enhances the stability period by 60\% and also
   improves the goodput by 31\% against LEACH and WSNCABC, respectively.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-68}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Recently, acupuncture of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
   becomes a better method compared with the western medicine for treating
   eye movement disorder. However, because therapeutic mechanism of TCM is
   very complicated, acupuncture of TCM depends on the doctor's experience
   to a large extent.
   INTRODUCTION: A Decision Support System (DSS) is urgently needed to
   carry out Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) in order to provide doctors
   with required clinical reference.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Save the data obtained by diplopia image test
   software to the database, and then upload the data from various data
   centers to the DSS which is based on Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) through the Web
   interface. Train these data to obtain a classification model with high
   accuracy, then download this classification model back to every data
   center to help them make classification prediction for new test samples,
   realizing CAD of eye movement disorder.
   RESULTS: The test software can get the diplopia images and test data
   quickly, and then the test data can be successfully stored to the
   database for future retrieve. Moreover the DSS can achieve the CAD with
   good results.
   DISCUSSION: The rounded software system can realize its expectant
   functions. It can get accurate classification model quickly. The
   accuracy of classification is increased to 62.5\%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility and accuracy of this DSS was proved by
   clinical experiments with good results. So it can be applied to provide
   CAD for eye movement disorder in hospitals.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{With the development of Web 2.0, sentiment analysis has been widely used
   in many domains, such as information retrieval (IR), artificial
   intelligence and social networks. This paper focuses on the task of
   classifying a textual review as expressing a positive or negative
   sentiment, a core task of sentiment analysis called sentiment
   classification. To address this problem, we present a novel sentiment
   classification model based on topic sequence which refers to topics in
   descending order of their distribution probabilities. Topics'
   distribution probabilities are obtained after training the latent
   dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. To the best of our knowledge, previous
   work didn't consider the importance of the order relationships among
   topics. We work on exploiting the order relationships among topics and
   using this information for sentiment classification. Based on it, three
   steps are followed to tackle this task. First, we train the LDA model to
   get the topic distribution. Then, we sort these topics in descending
   order to get the topic sequence, which are used to construct topic
   co-occurrence matrices (positive and negative). Finally we use these two
   matrices to classify the test examples as positive or negative. The
   experiments show that our classification model obtains better results
   than many existing classifiers and the topic sequence plays an important
   role for sentiment classification.}},

Abstract = {{Different from a large number of existing studies in the literature,
   this paper addresses two important issues in managing production lines,
   the problems of line balancing and model sequencing, concurrently. A
   novel hybrid agent-based ant colony optimization-genetic algorithm

   provides ants the opportunity of selecting a random behavior among ten
   heuristics commonly used in the line balancing domain. A numerical
   example is given to illustrate the solution building procedure of the
   algorithm and the evolution of the chromosomes. The performance of the
   developed algorithm is also assessed through test problems and analysis
   of their solutions through a statistical test, namely paired sample t
   test. In accordance with the test results, it is statistically proven

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are networks of nodes equipped with
   cognitive radios that can optimize performance by adapting to network
   conditions. Although various routing protocols incorporating varying
   degrees of adaptiveness and cognition have been proposed for CRNs, these
   works have mostly been limited by their system-level focus (that
   emphasizes optimization at the level of an individual cognitive radio
   system). The vision of CRNs as cognitive networks, however, requires
   that the research focus progresses from its current system-level
   fixation to the a network-wide optimization focus. This motivates the
   development of cognitive routing protocols envisioned as routing
   protocols that fully and seamlessly incorporate artificial intelligence
   (AI)-based techniques into their design. In this paper, we provide a
   self-contained exposition of various decision-theoretic and learning
   techniques from the field of AI and machine-learning that are relevant
   to the problem of cognitive routing in CRNs. Apart from providing
   necessary background, we present for each technique discussed in this
   paper their application in the context of CRNs in general and for the
   routing problem in particular. We also highlight challenges associated
   with these techniques and common pitfalls. Finally, open research issues

Journal = {{CONSTRAINTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-58}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Constrained sampling and counting are two fundamental problems arising
   in domains ranging from artificial intelligence and security, to
   hardware and software testing. Recent approaches to approximate
   solutions for these problems rely on employing SAT solvers and universal
   hash functions that are typically encoded as XOR constraints of length
   n/2 for an input formula with n variables. As the runtime performance of
   SAT solvers heavily depends on the length of XOR constraints, recent
   research effort has been focused on reduction of length of XOR
   constraints. Consequently, a notion of Independent Support was proposed,
   and it was shown that constructing XORs over independent support (if
   known) can lead to a significant reduction in the length of XOR
   constraints without losing the theoretical guarantees of sampling and
   counting algorithms. In this paper, we present the first algorithmic
   procedure (and a corresponding tool, called MIS) to determine minimal
   independent support for a given CNF formula by employing a reduction to
   group minimal unsatisfiable subsets (GMUS). By utilizing minimal
   independent supports computed by MIS, we provide new tighter bounds on
   the length of XOR constraints for constrained counting and sampling.
   Furthermore, the universal hash functions constructed from independent
   supports computed by MIS provide two to three orders of magnitude
   performance improvement in state-of-the-art constrained sampling and
   counting tools, while still retaining theoretical guarantees.}},

Abstract = {{Root causes identification of product infant failure is nowadays one of
   the critical topics in product quality improvements. This paper puts
   forward a novel technical approach for mechanism analysis of product
   infant failure based on domain mapping in Axiomatic Design and the
   quality and reliability data from product lifecycle in the form of
   relational tree. The proposed method could intelligently decompose the
   early fault symptoms into root causes of critical functional parameters
   in function domain, design parameters in physical domain and process
   parameters in process domain successively. More specifically, both
   qualitative and quantitative attributes of quality and reliability types
   are considered for solving the root causes weight computation problem of
   product infant failure, this approach emphasizes the integrated
   application of artificial intelligence techniques of Rough Set and fuzzy
   TOPSIS to compute the weight of root causes. In order to enumerate the
   latent root causes of product infant failure, connotation of product
   infant failure based on the product reliability evolution model in the
   life cycle and data integration model of quality and reliability in
   production based on the extended QR chain are presented firstly. Then, a
   decomposition method for relational tree of product infant failure is
   studied based on domains of functional, physical and process in
   Axiomatic Design. The failure relation weight computation of root causes
   (nodes of relational tree) is considered as multi-criteria decision
   making problem (MCDM) by integrated application of Rough Set and fuzzy
   TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution),
   which the Rough Set is used to mining the quality data and fuzzy TOPSIS
   is adopted to model the computation process of failure relation weight.
   Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified by a case study
   of analyzing a car infant failure about body noise vibration harshness
   complaint, and the result proves that the proposed approach is conducive
   to improve the intelligent level of root causes identification for
   complex product infant failure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the early stage of product design, particularly for consumer
   products, affective design, engineering, and marketing issues must be
   taken into considerationand they are commonly performed respectively by
   product designers, engineers, and marketing personnel. However, they
   have different concerns and focuses with regard to the new product
   design. Thus, these three processes are commonly conducted separately,
   leading to a sub-optimal and even sub-standard design. Such scenario
   indicates the need to incorporate the concerns of the three processes in
   the early stage of product design. However, no study has explored the
   incorporation of the concerns of the three processes into the product
   design. In this paper, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based methodology
   for integrating affective design, engineering, and marketing for
   defining design specifications of new products is proposed by which the
   concerns of the three processes can be considered simultaneously in the
   early design stage. The proposed methodology mainly involves development
   of customer satisfaction and cost models using fuzzy regression,
   generation of product utility functions using chaos-based fuzzy
   regression, formulation of a multi-objective optimization model and its
   solving using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGAII). A
   case study was conducted for electric iron design to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{As one of the most important energy resources, an accurate prediction
   for crude oil price can effectively guarantee a rapid new production
   development with higher production quality and less production cost.
   Accordingly, a novel decomposition-and-ensemble learning paradigm
   integrating ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and extended
   extreme learning machine (EELM) is proposed for crude oil price
   forecasting, based on the principle of ``decomposition and ensemble{''}.
   This novel learning model makes contribution to literature by
   introducing the current powerful artificial intelligent (AI) technique
   of EELM in the ensemble model formulation. In the proposed method, EEMD,
   a competitive decomposition method, is first applied to divide the
   original data of crude oil price time series into a number of relatively
   regular components, for simplicity. Second, EELM, a currently proposed,
   powerful, effective and stable forecasting tool, is implemented to
   predict all components independently. Finally, these predicted results
   are aggregated into an ensemble result as final prediction, using simple
   addition ensemble method. For illustration and verification purposes,
   the proposed learning paradigm is used to predict the crude oil spot
   price of WTI. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed novel
   ensemble learning paradigm statistically outperforms all considered
   benchmark models (including popular single models and similar ensemble
   models) in both prediction accuracy (in terms of level and directional
   measurement) and effectiveness (in terms of time saving and robustness),
   indicating that it is a promising tool to predict complicated time
   series with high volatility and irregularity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Small isolated power systems often experience generator outages, which
   are responsible for the activation of the under-frequency load shedding
   scheme with the corresponding negative impact on electricity consumers
   and, hence, market loss. There are three main causes of this problem:
   the power system's low inertia, the speed governors' low capacity, and a
   poor size-ratio between generator and system. The most extensive
   research line in this area is focused on the optimization of the load
   shedding scheme, which is a partial solution. Another research line is
   presented to solve the problem from the point of view of the system
   operator. This paper proposes an online method to predict and correct
   possible load shedding by redistributing load dispatching. This proposal
   uses artificial intelligence techniques, in particular neural networks,
   and a special-purpose power system simulator. In order to evaluate the
   proposal, the achieved solution is applied to a real case study: the
   island of Gran Canaria. This application shows the improvement that
   might be achieved by implementing this simple method. The method
   proposed in this paper is strongly recommended for regions that have
   suitable geographical sites as well as energy problems similar to those
   of the Canary Islands (see tech. rep. ``Map of the Canary Islands Power
   Systems{''} by Red Electrica de Espana).}},

Abstract = {{DNA microarray is an efficient new technology that allows to analyze, at
   the same time, the expression level of millions of genes. The gene
   expression level indicates the synthesis of different messenger
   ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecule in a cell. Using this gene expression
   level, it is possible to diagnose diseases, identify tumors, select the
   best treatment to resist illness, detect mutations among other
   processes. In order to achieve that purpose, several computational
   techniques such as pattern classification approaches can be applied. The
   classification problem consists in identifying different classes or
   groups associated with a particular disease (e.g., various types of
   cancer, in terms of the gene expression level). However, the enormous
   quantity of genes and the few samples available, make difficult the
   processes of learning and recognition of any classification technique.
   Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computational models in artificial
   intelligence used for classifying, predicting and approximating
   functions. Among the most popular ones, we could mention the multilayer
   perceptron (MLP), the radial basis function neural network (RBF) and
   support vector machine (SVM). The aim of this research is to propose a
   methodology for classifying DNA microarray. The proposed method performs
   a feature selection process based on a swarm intelligence algorithm to
   find a subset of genes that best describe a disease. After that,
   different ANN are trained using the subset of genes. Finally, four
   different datasets were used to validate the accuracy of the proposal
   and test the relevance of genes to correctly classify the samples of the
   disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, a new soft computing framework is developed for
   solving nanofluidic problems based on fluid flow and heat transfer of
   multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) along a flat plate with Navier slip
   boundary with the help of artificial neural networks (ANNs), Genetic
   Algorithms (GAs), Interior-Point Algorithm (IPA), and hybridized
   approach GA-IPA. Original PDEs associated with the problem are
   transformed into system of nonlinear ODEs using similarity
   transformation. Mathematical model of transformed system is constructed
   by exploiting the strength of universal function approximation ability
   of ANNs and an unsupervised error function is formulated for the system
   in a least mean square sense. Learning of the design variable of the
   networks is carried out with GAs supported with IPA for rapid local
   convergence. The design scheme is applied to solve number of variants by
   taking water, engine oil, and kerosene oil as a base fluids mixed with
   different concentrations of MWCNTs. The reliability and effectiveness of
   the design scheme is measured with the help of results of statistical
   analysis based on sufficient large number of independent runs of the
   algorithms rather than single successful run. The comparative studies of
   the proposed solution are made with standard numerical results in order
   to establish the correctness of the given scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel intelligent computational approach is developed
   for finding the solution of nonlinear singular system governed by
   boundary value problems of Flierl-Petviashivili equations using
   artificial neural networks optimized with genetic algorithms, sequential
   quadratic programming technique, and their combinations. The competency
   of artificial neural network for universal function approximation is
   exploited in formulation of mathematical modelling of the equation based
   on an unsupervised error with specialty of satisfying boundary
   conditions at infinity. The training of the weights of the networks is
   carried out with memetic computing based on genetic algorithm used as a
   tool for reliable global search method, hybridized with sequential
   quadratic programming technique used as a tool for rapid local
   convergence. The proposed scheme is evaluated on three variants of the
   two boundary problems by taking different values of nonlinearity
   operators and constant coefficients. The reliability and effectiveness
   of the design approaches are validated through the results of
   statistical analyses based on sufficient large number of independent
   runs in terms of accuracy, convergence, and computational complexity.
   Comparative studies of the proposed results are made with state of the
   art analytical solvers, which show a good agreement mostly and even
   better in few cases as well. The intrinsic worth of the schemes is
   simplicity in the concept, ease in implementation, to avoid singularity
   at origin, to deal with strong nonlinearity effectively, and their
   ability to handle exactly traditional initial conditions along with
   boundary condition at infinity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Slope failures across mountain roads can damage man-made structures,
   interrupt traffic, and give rise to fatal accidents. Disastrous
   consequences of these hazards necessitate the approach for predicting
   their occurrences. In practice, slope collapse prediction can be
   formulated as a classification problem with two class labels: collapse
   and noncollapse. This study aims at proposing a novel approach for slope
   collapse assessment. The newly established method integrates the
   Bayesian framework and the K-nearest neighbor density estimation
   technique. The Bayesian framework is employed to achieve probabilistic
   slope stability estimations. Meanwhile, the K-nearest neighbor technique
   is a nonparametric approach to approximate the conditional probability
   density functions. In addition, a database that contains 211 slope
   evaluation samples has been collected in the Taiwan Provincial Highway
   Nos. 18 and 21 is used to construct and verify the slope assessment
   model. Experimental results point out that the proposed model has
   achieved a roughly 8\% improvement in accuracy rate compared with other
   benchmark methods. Hence, the new method is a promising tool to help
   decision-makers in slope collapse assessment and disaster prevention

Abstract = {{The shear strength of reinforced concrete (RC) deep beams is a dynamic
   phenomenon that varies with many mechanical and geometrical factors.
   Accurately estimating shear strength in RC deep beams is a vital issue
   in engineering design and management. However, prediction accuracy is
   still poor. This study presents a nature-inspired metaheuristic
   regression method for accurately predicting shear strength in RC deep
   beams that combines a novel smart artificial firefly colony algorithm
   (SFA) and least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR). The SFA
   integrates the firefly algorithm (FA), chaotic map (CM), adaptive
   inertia weight (AIW), and Lvy flight (LF). First, an adaptive approach
   and randomization methods (i.e., CM, AIW, and LF) were incorporated in
   FA to construct an effective metaheuristic algorithm for global
   optimization. The SFA was then used to optimize the hyperparameters of
   the LS-SVR model. The proposed model was constructed using a data set
   for RC deep beams which was derived from the literature. Model
   performance was evaluated by comparing results with those of a baseline
   SVR model and with previous methods via a cross validation algorithm.
   Analytical results show that the novel optimized prediction model is
   superior to others in predicting the shear strength of RC deep beams and
   that it can assist civil engineers in designing RC deep beam structures.

   of each driver is analyzed using time simulations where the motor is

Abstract = {{Brain tumor grade identification is an invasive technique and clinicians
   rely on biopsy and spinal tap method. The proposed method takes an
   effort to develop a non-invasive method for the tumor grade (Low/High)

   feature selection and classification. An analysis on the performance of
   the segmentation techniques, feature extraction methods, automatic
   feature selection (SFLA) and constructed classifiers (support vector
   machines, learning vector quantization and Naives Bayes) is done on the
   basis of accuracy, efficiency and elapsed time. This analysis motivates
   towards the accurate determination of tumor grade from MR images instead
   of depending on magnetic resonant spectroscopy and biopsy. Fuzzy c-means
   segmentation outperformed other segmentation techniques, shape and size
   based textural feature promoted the demarcation of tumor grades, Naive
   Bayes classifier succeeded in terms of efficiency, error and elapse time
   when compared with SVM and LVQ The study was carried out with 200 images

Abstract = {{While some computational models of intelligence test problems were
   proposed throughout the second half of the XXth century, in the first
   years of the XXIst century we have seen an increasing number of computer
   systems being able to score well on particular intelligence test tasks.
   However, despite this increasing trend there has been no general account
   of all these works in terms of how they relate to each other and what
   their real achievements are. Also, there is poor understanding about
   what intelligence tests measure in machines, whether they are useful to
   evaluate AI systems, whether they are really challenging problems, and
   whether they are useful to understand (human) intelligence. In this
   paper, we provide some insight on these issues, in the form of nine
   specific questions, by giving a comprehensive account of about thirty
   computer models, from the 1960s to nowadays, and their relationships,
   focussing on the range of intelligence test tasks they address, the
   purpose of the models, how general or specialised these models are, the
   AI techniques they use in each case, their comparison with human
   performance, and their evaluation of item difficulty. As a conclusion,
   these tests and the computer models attempting them show that AI is
   still lacking general techniques to deal with a variety of problems at
   the same time. Nonetheless, a renewed attention on these problems and a
   more careful understanding of what intelligence tests offer for AI may
   help build new bridges between psychometrics, cognitive science, and AI;
   and may motivate new kinds of problem repositories. (c) 2015 Elsevier

Volume = {{230}},
Pages = {{134-172}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel method for building affectively intellignt
   human-interactive agents. The method is based on a key sociological
   insight that has been developed and extensively verified over the last
   twenty years, but has yet to make an impact in artificial intelligence.
   The insight is that resource bounded humans will, by default, act to
   maintain affective consistency. Humans have culturally shared
   fundamental affective sentiments about identities, behaviours, and
   objects, and they act so that the transient affective sentiments created
   during interactions confirm the fundamental sentiments. Humans seek and
   create situations that confirm or are consistent with, and avoid and
   suppress situations that disconfirm or are inconsistent with, their
   culturally shared affective sentiments. This ``affect control
   principle{''} has been shown to be a powerful predictor of human
   behaviour. In this paper, we present a probabilistic and
   decision-theoretic generalisation of this principle, and we demonstrate
   how it can be leveraged to build affectively intelligent artificial
   agents. The new model, called BayesAct, can maintain multiple hypotheses
   about sentiments simultaneously as a probability distribution, and can
   make use of an explicit utility function to make value-directed action
   choices. This allows the model to generate affectively intelligent
   interactions with people by learning about their identity, predicting
   their behaviours using the affect control principle, and taking actions
   that are simultaneously goal-directed and affect-sensitive. We
   demonstrate this generalisation with a set of simulations. We then show
   how our model can be used as an emotional ``plug-in{''} for artificially
   intelligent systems that interact with humans in two different settings:

Abstract = {{Most of the existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for data
   regression commonly assume that the data samples are completely clean
   without noise or worst yet, only the symmetrical noise is in
   considerations. However in the real world applications, this is often
   not the case. This paper addresses a significant note of inefficiency in
   methods for regression when dealing with outliers, especially for cases
   with polarity of noise involved (i.e., one sided noise with either only
   positive noise or negative noise). Using soft margin loss function
   concept, we propose Constrained Optimization method based Extreme
   Learning Machine for Regression, hereafter denoted as CO-ELM-R. The
   proposed method incorporates the two Lagrange multipliers that mimic
   Support Vector Regression (SVR) into the basis of ELM to cope with
   infeasible constraints of the regression optimization problem. Thus,
   CO-ELM-R will complement the recursive iterations of SVR in the training
   phase due to the fact that ELM is much simpler in structure and faster
   in implementation. The proposed CO-ELM-R is evaluated empirically on a
   few benchmark data sets and a real world application of NOx gas emission
   data set collected from one of the power plant in Malaysia. The obtained
   results have demonstrated its validity and efficacy in handling noisy
   data regression problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an artificial bee colony algorithm for the problem of

   honeybees. In this framework, bees produce candidate solutions for the
   problem by exploring the vicinity of food sources. The proposed approach
   exploits useful knowledge of the problem at this neighbourhood
   exploration, considering the partial destruction and heuristical
   reconstruction of selected solutions. We show the effectiveness of our
   model through an empirical analysis where three different contexts are
   considered: easy, challenging, and difficult problem cases. The results
   are compared with those of a genetic algorithm and the current

Title = {{RVIP: an indistinguishable approach to scalable network simulation at

Abstract = {{In the hybrid simulation research, we investigate a new approach to
   build software virtual networks (SVNs) that are indistinguishable from
   their equivalent real live networks (LNs). We define the concept of
   `Network's Interactive Turing Test' based on the similar concept used in
   the artificial intelligence areas. Our goal is to actualize the
   interactive and indistinguishable real-virtual interface pair (RVIP) for
   large-scale computer network simulations. By RVIP's support, a single
   SVN is indistinguishable from its equivalent LN. In the entire hybrid
   system, multiple LNs and multiple SVNs are connected using many RVIPs in
   an arbitrary topology and at real time. To actualize RVIP, the following
   necessary conditions must be satisfied: (i) the performance of the
   underlying simulation platform must be faster than real time; (ii) all
   needed changes incurred by introducing any SVN into an LN scenario are
   put on the simulation's side. To interact with an SVN, RVIP requires
   that no change is made on any live node; (iii) an SVN does not exchange
   simulation events with LNs, that is, only standard IP protocol
   interactions between SVN and LN are allowed. (iv) Any LN can be
   dynamically plugged into the hybrid scenario at real time, just like
   being plugged into an equivalent purely LN. Compared with existing
   hybrid simulation efforts on NS-3, QualNet's EXata and OPNET's
   system-in-the-loop, in this paper, we use the actual RVIP implementation
   to show that RVIP is a better candidate to pass the Network's
   Interactive Turing Test owing to the following two advantages: (i) an
   interactive network tester can easily distinguish the existing hybrid
   networks from the LNs by using a live topology that cannot be simulated,
   for example, by including the entire live Internet. But RVIP is not
   vulnerable to such tests. RVIP can support hybrid scenarios with
   multiple SVNs and multiple LNs connected by an arbitrary network
   topology, and with the LNs on and off at anytime. (ii) Performance-wise,
   our studies show that RVIP provides more efficient support in terms of
   common metrics such as larger throughput limit and smaller extra
   latency; thus, the simulated SVNs are more indistinguishable from their
   live counterparts. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, experiments concerning the prediction of water and
   natural gas consumption are presented, focusing on how to exploit data
   heterogeneity to get a reliable outcome. Prior to this, an up-to-date
   state-of-the-art review on the available datasets and forecasting
   techniques of water and natural gas consumption, is conducted. A
   collection of techniques (Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Belief
   Networks, Echo State Networks, Support Vector Regression, Genetic
   Programming and Extended Kalman Filter-Genetic Programming), partially
   selected from the state-of-the-art ones, are evaluated using the few
   publicly available datasets. The tests are performed according to two
   key aspects: homogeneous evaluation criteria and application of
   heterogeneous data. Experiments with heterogeneous data obtained
   combining multiple types of resources (water, gas, energy and
   temperature), aimed to short-term prediction, have been possible using
   the Almanac of Minutely Power dataset (AMPds). On the contrary, the
   Energy Information Administration (E.I.A.) data are used for long-term
   prediction combining gas and temperature information. At the end, the
   selected approaches have been evaluated using the sole Tehran water
   consumption for long-term forecasts (thanks to the full availability of
   the dataset). The AMPds and E.I.A. natural gas results show a
   correlation with temperature, that produce a performance improvement.
   The ANN and SVR approaches achieved good performance for both
   long/short-term predictions, while the EKF-GP showed good outcomes with
   the E.I.A. datasets. Finally, it is the authors purpose to create a
   valid starting point for future works that aim to develop innovative
   forecasting approaches, providing a fair comparison among different
   computational intelligence and machine learning techniques. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The diversity of solutions is of great importance for multi-objective
   evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, a new multi-objective particle
   swarm optimization algorithm based on decomposition (MPSO/D) is
   proposed. Firstly, the objective space of a multi-objective problem is
   decomposed into a set of sub-regions based on a set of direction
   vectors. Then MPSO/D makes each sub-region have a solution to maintain
   the diversity. Secondly, considering the convergence of solutions,
   MPSO/D uses the crowding distance to calculate the fitness values of the
   reserved solutions for selection operator, and uses the neighboring
   particles of a particle to determine the global best historical position
   (gbest) of the particle. The proposed algorithm has been compared with
   NSGAII, MOEA/D and NNIA on sixteen test sets. The experimental results
   illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms NSGAII, MOEA/D and
   NNIA in terms of convergence and diversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In a multithreaded program, competition of threads for shared resources
   raises the deadlock possibility, which narrows the system liveness.
   Because such errors appear in specific schedules of concurrent
   executions of threads, runtime verification of threads behavior is a
   significant concern. In this study, we extended our previous approach
   for prediction of runtime behavior of threads may lead to an impasse.
   Such a prediction is of importance because of the nondeterministic
   manner of competing threads. The prediction process tries to forecast
   future behavior of threads based on their observed behavior. To this
   end, we map observed behavior of threads into time-series data sets and
   use statistical and artificial intelligence methods for forecasting
   subsequent members of the sets as future behavior of the threads. The
   deadlock prediction is carried out based on probing the allocation graph
   obtained from actual and predicted allocation of resources to threads.
   In our approach, we use an artificial neural network (ANN) because ANNs
   enjoy the applicable performance and flexibility in predicting complex
   behavior. Using three case studies, we contrasted results of the current
   and our previous approaches to demonstrate results. Copyright (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Manufacturing enterprises are socio-technical systems, which necessitate
   overall integration of not only the technical aspects from devices in
   shop-floor to enterprise resources planning vertically and from product
   order to shipment horizontally, but also the social aspects such as
   human interactions and consumers' intentions. Moreover, there is a
   growing need in the use of knowledge in enterprise contexts. To meet
   such needs, wisdom manufacturing (WM) is emerging with advances in the
   Internet and manufacturing as well as intelligence. In this paper, the
   most recently developed manufacturing models such as smart manufacturing
   (SM)/smart factory (SF), cloud manufacturing (CM) and socialised
   enterprise (SE)/Enterprise 2.0 are analysed, and a WM vision is
   presented to aggregate SM, CM, SE and existing intelligent manufacturing
   (IM) that are complementary to each other. Then pathways towards the WM
   vision are addressed in relationship to knowledge, intelligence,
   creativity/innovation, learning and wisdom, especially from DIKW
   (data-information-knowledge-wisdom) and semiotic perspectives as well as
   from the web evolution. And wisdom and realisation towards the WM vision
   are investigated. Finally, a case study is used to illustrate the WM
   vision landscape followed by a conclusion. As a consequence, things,
   computers and humans, ubiquitous, artificial and collective
   intelligence, as well as explicit and tacit knowledge, are integrated as
   a whole in the WM.}},

Abstract = {{This paper shows an improvement of legal decision-making via digitally
   produced verdicts. We investigate the use of Artificial Intelligence
   (AI) in relation to rendering arbitrational verdicts. The data was
   provided by e-Court, the first private online court of the Netherlands.
   In our survey the standard debt collection proceedings under Dutch Civil
   and Procedural law are used as a case study. The introduction of the
   subject matter is followed by an overview of the key-parameters required
   by e-Court for rendering a verdict in default cases. The reasoning
   methodologies of Intelligent Systems in the legal domain are then
   discussed. Following this discussion, we will analyze the nature of the
   e-Court System to understand how it benefits from the various types of
   Intelligent Systems. Subsequently, we will discuss the rationale behind
   the choices made, the legal implications and the handling process within
   the public courts. We review in brief some expectations about the
   further developments and compare them with the current best practices at
   the Dutch e-Court. Our contribution lies also in the investigation of
   the characteristics of the e-Court system for rendering default verdicts
   in debt collection proceedings. In our conclusion we will consider to
   what extent intelligent systems will be used in the contemporary digital
   court houses.}},

Abstract = {{Machine learning is one of the most important subfields of computer
   science and can be used to solve a variety of interesting artificial
   intelligence problems. There are different languages, framework and
   tools to define the data needed to solve machine learning-based
   problems. However, there is a great number of very diverse alternatives
   which makes it difficult the intercommunication, portability and
   re-usability of the definitions, designs or algorithms that any
   developer may create. In this paper, we take the first step towards a
   language and a development environment independent of the underlying
   technologies, allowing developers to design solutions to solve machine
   learning-based problems in a simple and fast way, automatically
   generating code for other technologies. That can be considered a
   transparent bridge among current technologies. We rely on Model-Driven
   Engineering approach, focusing on the creation of models to abstract the
   definition of artifacts from the underlying technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty and inconsistency pervade human knowledge. Possibilistic
   logic, where propositional logic formulas are associated with lower
   bounds of a necessity measure, handles uncertainty in the setting of
   possibility theory. Moreover, central in standard possibilistic logic is
   the notion of inconsistency level of a possibilistic logic base, closely
   related to the notion of consistency degree of two fuzzy sets introduced
   by L. A. Zadeh. Formulas whose weight is strictly above this
   inconsistency level constitute a sub-base free of any inconsistency.
   However, several extensions, allowing for a paraconsistent form of
   reasoning, or associating possibilistic logic formulas with information
   sources or subsets of agents, or extensions involving other possibility
   theory measures, provide other forms of inconsistency, while enlarging
   the representation capabilities of possibilistic logic. The paper offers
   a structured overview of the various forms of inconsistency that can be
   accommodated in possibilistic logic. This overview echoes the rich
   representation power of the possibility theory framework.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we are interested in the fact that relevance and
   trustworthiness of information acquired by an agent X from a source F
   strictly depends and derives from X's trust in F with respect to the
   kind of information. In particular, we are interested in analyzing the
   relevance of F's category as indicator for its trustworthiness with
   respect to the specific informative goals of X. In this article, we
   analyze an interactive cognitive model for searching information in a
   world in which each agent can be considered as belonging to a specific
   agent's category. We also consider variability within the canonical
   categorical behavior and consequent influence on the trustworthiness of
   provided information. The introduced interactive cognitive model also
   allows evaluation of the trustworthiness of a source both on the basis
   of its category and on past direct experience with it, thus selecting
   the more adequate source with respect to the informative goals to
   achieve. We present a computational approach based on fuzzy sets and
   some selected simulation scenarios together with the discussion of their
   more interesting results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the challenging problem of disorientation of
   elderly people living at home. In order to detect confusion, we monitor
   the behaviour of the elderly and identify actions that appear alarming
   in a sensorized and video-controlled smart environment. In the past, our
   research has focused on identifying situations, activities and
   interactions between various actors based on user-understandable models.
   This work addresses the development of a simulation tool capable of
   synthesizing sensor data and low-level/medium-level scene events. The
   tool is of great interest with regard to the design and configuration of
   an elderly disorientation recognition system because it reduces the
   laborious and expensive need for experimentation with real devices. We
   integrate this proposal in a comprehensive framework that distinguishes
   between a recognition line and a simulation line in a potentially
   continuous and closed cycle. The recognition line goes from a
   multisensory monitored scene to its semantic interpretation, which could
   be completed even with only the narration of the facts. In the opposite
   direction, the simulation line goes from the narration of a scene to its
   synthesis with the same semantic content into a 3D simulation and the
   corresponding sensor signals and low/medium events at specific location
   points.}},

Abstract = {{This paper attempts to give a high-level overview of the field of
   artificial and computational intelligence (AI/CI) in games, with
   particular reference to how the different core research areas within
   this field inform and interact with each other, both actually and
   potentially. We identify ten main research areas within this field: NPC
   behavior learning, search and planning, player modeling, games as AI
   benchmarks, procedural content generation, computational narrative,
   believable agents, AI-assisted game design, general game artificial
   intelligence and AI in commercial games. We view and analyze the areas
   from three key perspectives: 1) the dominant AI method(s) used under
   each area; 2) the relation of each area with respect to the end (human)
   user; and 3) the placement of each area within a human-computer
   (player-game) interaction perspective. In addition, for each of these
   areas we consider how it could inform or interact with each of the other
   areas; in those cases where we find that meaningful interaction either
   exists or is possible, we describe the character of that interaction and
   provide references to published studies, if any. We believe that this
   paper improves understanding of the current nature of the game AI/CI
   research field and the interdependences between its core areas by
   providing a unifying overview. We also believe that the discussion of
   potential interactions between research areas provides a pointer to many
   interesting future research projects and unexplored subfields.}},

Abstract = {{Digital games often center on a series of challenges designed to vary in
   difficulty over the course of the game. Designers, however, lack ways to
   ensure challenges are suitably tailored to the abilities of each game
   player, often resulting in player boredom or frustration. Challenge
   tailoring refers to the general problem of matching designer-intended
   challenges to player abilities. We present an approach to predict
   temporal player performance and select appropriate content to solve the
   challenge tailoring problem. Our temporal collaborative filtering
   approach-tensor factorization-captures similarities among players and
   the challenges they face to predict player performance on unseen, future
   challenges. Tensor factorization accounts for varying player abilities
   over time and is a generic approach capable of modeling many kinds of
   players. We use constraint solving to optimize content selection to
   match player skills to a designer-specified level of performance and
   present a model-performance curves-for designers to specify desired,
   temporally changing player behavior. We evaluate our approach in a
   role-playing game through two empirical studies of humans and one study
   using simulated agents. Our studies show tensor factorization scales in
   multiple game-relevant data dimensions, can be used for modestly
   effective game adaptation, and can predict divergent player learning
   trends.}},

Abstract = {{Storytelling plays an important role in human life, from everyday
   communication to entertainment. Interactive storytelling (IS) offers its
   audience an opportunity to actively participate in the story being told,
   particularly in video games. Managing the narrative experience of the
   player is a complex process that involves choices, authorial goals and
   constraints of a given story setting (e.g., a fairy tale). Over the last
   several decades, a number of experience managers using artificial
   intelligence (AI) methods such as planning and constraint satisfaction
   have been developed. In this paper, we extend existing work and propose
   a new AI experience manager called player-specific automated
   storytelling (PAST), which uses automated planning to satisfy the story
   setting and authorial constraints in response to the player's actions.
   Out of the possible stories algorithmically generated by the planner in
   response, the one that is expected to suit the player's style best is
   selected. To do so, we employ automated player modeling. We evaluate
   PAST within a video-game domain with user studies and discuss the
   effects of combining planning and player modeling on the player's
   perception of agency.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a distributed adaptive partitioning algorithm inspired by
   division of labor in honeybees is investigated for its applicability in
   a swarm of underwater robots in one hand and is qualitatively compared
   with the behavior of honeybee colonies on the other hand. The algorithm,
   partitioning social inhibition (PSI), is based on local interactions and
   uses a simple logic inspired from age-polyethism and task allocation in
   honeybee colonies. The algorithm is analyzed in simulation and is
   successfully applied here to partition a swarm of underwater robots into
   groups demonstrating its adaptivity to changes and applicability in real
   world systems. In a turn towards the inspiration origins of the
   algorithm, three honeybee colonies are then studied for age-polyethism
   behaviors and the results are contrasted with a simulated swarm running
   the PSI algorithm. Similar effects are detected in both the biological
   and simulated swarms suggesting biological plausibility of the
   mechanisms employed by the artificial system.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a methodology to teach students to develop
   mechatronic projects. It was taught in higher education schools, in
   different universities in Mexico, in courses such as: Robotics, Control

   intention of this methodology is not only to achieve the integration of
   different subjects but also to accomplish synergy between them so that
   the final result may be the best possible in quality, time and
   robustness. Since its introduction into the educational area, this
   methodology was evaluated and modified for approximately five years,
   were substantial characteristics were adopted. For the next ten years,
   only minor alterations were carried out. Fifteen years of experience
   have proven that the methodology is useful not only for training but
   also for real projects. In this article, we first explain the
   methodology and its main characteristics, as well as a brief history of
   its teaching in different educational programs. Then, we present two
   cases were the methodology was successfully applied. The first project
   consisted in the design, construction and evaluation of a mobile robotic
   manipulator which aims to be used as an explosives ordnance device. In
   the second case, we document the results of a project assignment for
   robotics tasks carried out by students which were formerly taught with

Pages = {{103-128}},

Abstract = {{The intent of this research is to generate a set of non-dominated
   finite-memory policies from which one of two agents (the leader) can
   select a most preferred policy to control a dynamic system that is also
   affected by the control decisions of the other agent (the follower). The
   problem is described by an infinite horizon total discounted reward,
   partially observed Markov game (POMG). For each candidate finite-memory
   leader policy, we assume the follower, fully aware of the leader policy,
   determines a (perfect memory) policy that optimizes the follower's
   (scalar) criterion. The leader-follower assumption allows the POMG to be
   transformed into a specially structured, partially observed Markov
   decision process that we use to determine the follower's best response
   policy for a given leader policy. We then approximate the follower's
   policy by a finite-memory policy. Each agent's policy assumes that the
   agent knows its current and recent state values, its recent actions, and
   the current and recent possibly inaccurate observations of the other
   agent's state. For each leader/follower policy pair, we determine the
   values of the leader's criteria. We use a multi-objective genetic
   algorithm to create the next generation of leader policies based on the
   values of the leader criteria for each leader/follower policy pair in
   the current generation. Based on this information for the final
   generation of policies, we determine the set of non-dominated leader
   policies. We present an example that illustrates how these results can
   be used to support a manager of a liquid egg production process (the
   leader) in selecting a sequence of actions to maximize expected process
   productivity while mitigating the risk due to an attacker (the follower)
   who seeks to contaminate the process with a chemical or biological
   toxin.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a leader-follower partially observed Markov game (POMG) and
   analyze how the value of the leader's criterion changes due to changes
   in the leader's quality of observation of the follower. We give
   conditions that insure improved observation quality will improve the
   leader's value function, assuming that changes in the observation
   quality do not cause the follower to change its policy. We show that
   discontinuities in the value of the leader's criterion, as a function of
   observation quality, can occur when the change of observation quality is
   significant enough for the follower to change its policy. We present
   conditions that determine when a discontinuity may occur and conditions
   that guarantee a discontinuity will not degrade the leader's
   performance. We show that when the leader and the follower are
   collaborative and the follower completely observes the leader's initial
   state, discontinuities in the leader's value function will not occur.
   However, examples show that improving observation quality does not
   necessarily improve the leader's criterion value, whether or not the

Abstract = {{An application of machine intelligence technique for the identification
   of micro-Doppler features from an airborne pulsed-Doppler radar sensor
   is developed. The key challenges for surveillance mode are the dynamic
   nature of the wind farm clutters, short-CPI length, and lack of prior
   information on the specific wind turbine (WT) in the site. The
   micro-Doppler spectrum segments based on short CPIs are used as the
   fundamental feature vectors for detection and classification. Both
   supervised and unsupervised approaches, including artificial neural
   network and random forest, are applied to airborne plan position
   indicator scan outputs. A simulator for airborne pulsed-Doppler radar
   operation over wind farm is used with realistic WT scattering
   signatures, platform motion impacts as well as the terrain clutter
   impacts. Based on the clutter identification result, the feasibility of
   detecting small moving targets in the presence of WT clutter is
   discussed.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ant colony optimization (ACO) has been successfully applied to
   classification, where the aim is to build a model that captures the
   relationships between the input attributes and the target class in a
   given domain's dataset. The constructed classification model can then be
   used to predict the unknown class of a new pattern. While artificial
   neural networks are one of the most widely used models for pattern
   classification, their application is commonly restricted to fully
   connected three-layer topologies. In this paper, we present a new
   algorithm, ANN-Miner, which uses ACO to learn the structure of
   feed-forward neural networks. We report computational results on 40
   benchmark datasets for several variations of the algorithm. Performance
   is compared to the standard three-layer structure trained with two
   different weight-learning algorithms (back propagation, and the
   algorithm), and also to a greedy algorithm for learning NN structures. A
   nonparametric Friedman test is used to determine statistical
   significance. In addition, we compare our proposed algorithm with NEAT,
   a prominent evolutionary algorithm for evolving neural networks, as well
   as three different well-known state-of-the-art classifiers, namely the
   C4.5 decision tree induction algorithm, the Ripper classification rule

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Blockmodel problem (BMP) deals with identifying structural similarities
   or equivalences among entities which, in turn, provide many insights
   into the structures or patterns of complex networks such as social
   networks. The objective of this problem is to find a small number of
   large blocks containing structural similarities or equivalences among
   entities in a given graph representing a complex network. In this paper,
   we present an evolutionary approach and a swarm intelligence approach
   for the BMP. The evolutionary approach consists of a steady-state
   grouping genetic algorithm (GA), whereas the swarm intelligence approach
   is based on the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. The BMP is a
   grouping problem, i.e., a problem whose objective is to find an optimal
   assignment of entities according to a given fitness function into
   different groups subject to some constraints. Grouping GAs are
   especially designed to handle grouping problems as the traditional GA
   suffers from the problem of redundancy, context insensitivity, and
   schema disruption while handling grouping problems. Our ABC algorithm is
   also designed in such a manner that it tries to preserve grouping
   information as far as possible in order to find high-quality solutions.
   To our knowledge, this is the first application of the ABC algorithm for
   a problem with a variable number of groups. Computational results show
   the effectiveness of our approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Bayesian network (BN) has been adopted as the underlying model for
   representing and inferring uncertain knowledge. As the basis of
   realistic applications centered on probabilistic inferences, learning a
   BN from data is a critical subject of machine learning, artificial
   intelligence, and big data paradigms. Currently, it is necessary to
   extend the classical methods for learning BNs with respect to
   data-intensive computing or in cloud environments. In this paper, we
   propose a parallel and incremental approach for data-intensive learning
   of BNs from massive, distributed, and dynamically changing data by
   extending the classical scoring and search algorithm and using
   MapReduce. First, we adopt the minimum description length as the scoring
   metric and give the two-pass MapReduce-based algorithms for computing
   the required marginal probabilities and scoring the candidate graphical
   model from sample data. Then, we give the corresponding strategy for
   extending the classical hill-climbing algorithm to obtain the optimal
   structure, as well as that for storing a BN by <key, value> pairs.
   Further, in view of the dynamic characteristics of the changing data, we
   give the concept of influence degree to measure the coincidence of the
   current BN with new data, and then propose the corresponding two-pass
   MapReduce-based algorithms for BNs incremental learning. Experimental
   results show the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of our
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Competitive models offer superiority in maximizing only a buyer's
   profit, and do not satisfy all members in a supply chain. However,
   coordinative models give benefit to the whole supply chain. Research has
   been carried out the application of these two types of models in the
   supplier selection problems. In this study, we have considered
   coopetition in a supply chain, with the objective of selecting a
   supplier from a pool of suppliers and allocating optimal order
   quantities for the acquisition of a firm's total requirements for a
   particular product. The competition in a one buyer- multiple suppliers
   system in the supplier selection process has been considered by applying
   mixed-integer nonlinear programming in first phase. On the other hand,
   the total cost to the whole supply chain is minimized rather than only
   for the buyer. Genetic Algorithm, Artificial Bee Colony, and Chaotic Bee
   Colony are used separately in the second phase as optimization
   techniques. We find that the All Units discount scheme is more
   preferable than the Incremental Units discount scheme. However, in the
   case for different values of the discount percentage and levels, or when
   supplier provides different type of scheme, other policies need to be
   explored. Finally, the proposed model is illustrated by a numerical
   example from the literature. A better result is found for the buyer's
   cost by applying the proposed two-phase method, while the result is
   comparable result for the supply chain cost.}},

Abstract = {{Guided by a polymath approach-encompassing neuroscience, philosophy,
   psychology and computer science, this article describes a novel
   `cognitive' computational mind framework for text comprehension in terms
   of Minsky's `Society of Mind' and `Emotion Machine' theories. Observing
   a top-down design method, we enumerate here the macrocosmic elements of
   the model-the `agencies' and memory constructs, followed by an
   elucidation on the working principles and synthesis concerns. Besides
   corroboration of results of a dry-run test by thoughts generated by
   random human subjects; the completeness of the conceptualized framework
   has been validated as a consequence of its total representation of `text
   understanding' functions of the human brain, types of human memory and
   emulation of the layers of the mind. A brief conceptual comparison,
   between the architecture and existing `conscious' agents, has been
   included as well. The framework, though observed here in its capacity as
   a text comprehender, is capable of understanding in general. A cognitive
   model of text comprehension, besides contributing to the `thinking
   machines' research enterprise, is envisioned to be strategic in the
   design of intelligent plagiarism checkers, literature genre-cataloguers,
   differential diagnosis systems, and educational aids for children with
   reading disorders. Turing's landmark 1950 article on computational
   intelligence is the principal motivator behind our research initiative.}},

Title = {{Modeling nonlinear behavior of Buckling-Restrained Braces via different
   artificial intelligence methods}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{923-938}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Five AI models are presented to model the dynamic nonlinear behavior of
   Buckling-Restrained Braces (BRBs). The AI techniques utilized in the
   models are: Time-Delayed Neural Networks (TDNN), Nonlinear
   Auto-Regressive exogenous (NARX) neural networks, Gaussian-Mixture
   Models Regression (GMMR), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS)
   and Polynomial Classifier Regression (PCR). The models are developed
   using time-delayed brace displacements inputs and brace force outputs to
   predict updated brace forces during load reversals. The training and
   testing of the AI models are performed using experimental data from BRB
   specimens tested at the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER)
   Center. The training stage for every method makes use of the
   experimental data from one specimen. In order to assess the models'
   learning and generalization capabilities, three sets of experimental
   data for different specimens are used. To arrive at an optimized
   architecture that best models the phenomenon, the model performance with
   different parameters is evaluated. The brace force predicted by the
   proposed model shows excellent resemblance to the experimental results
   for the training sample, for all techniques. The predicted behavior of
   the testing samples shows noticeable accuracy and further demonstrates
   the generalization and prediction capability of the proposed modeling
   techniques. The various techniques are compared on the basis of selected
   performance criteria. It is found that the performance of two AI
   techniques standout among the others: the NARX and the PCR. Although the
   NARX demonstrates a slight advantage in the prediction accuracy over the
   PCR, the latter is far more superior in terms of computational
   efficiency. Thus, the PCR would be recommended for scenarios where
   online training is needed. The BRB design and performance investigation
   processes can be facilitated by the developed modeling techniques thus
   minimizing the need for, and extent of, experimental testing. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the number of digital images has increased so that the
   management of this volume of data needs an efficient system for
   browsing, categorising and searching. Automatic image annotation is
   designed for assigning tags to images for more accurate retrieval.
   Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) is a traditional machine
   learning technique for decomposing a matrix into a set of basis and
   coefficients under the non-negative constraints. In this study, the
   authors propose a two-step algorithm for designing an automatic image
   annotation system that employs the NMF framework for its first step and
   a variant of K-nearest neighbourhood as its second step. In the first
   step, a new multimodal NMF algorithm is proposed to extract the latent
   factors which reflect the content of images. This is done by jointly
   factorising the visual and textual data feature matrices so that they
   have close representation, although not necessarily the same. In the
   second step, after mapping images to the latent factors space a few tags
   are predicted for the new images based on a weighted average of similar
   data. They evaluated the performance of the proposed method and compared
   it to the state-of-the-art literature. Comparison results demonstrate
   the effectiveness and potential of the proposed method in image
   annotation applications.}},

Abstract = {{Machine Learning algorithms have a broad applicability, although
   generally a huge effort is necessary to find a good configuration for a
   given task. The tuning of free parameters, for example, is a task that
   directly affects the algorithm's performance but is often carried out as
   an ad hoc process. An alternative approach is to define the problem as a
   search in the parameters space, which can be computationally expensive
   and slow. Furthermore, to apply an algorithm to a different problem, all
   the work must be done from scratch. Transfer learning can be used to
   avoid this rework. In this paper we propose an approach to tune the
   parameter by means of transfer learning. The idea is to use data
   complexity characterization measures to evaluate the similarity among
   datasets and evaluate whether they share similar configurations of good
   parameters. To compare our approach, four performance measures were
   used: area under ROC Curve (AUC), accuracy, F1 and area under
   Precision-Recall Curve. Results show that the proposed approach may
   reduce the search space for the parameter tuning by exploiting parameter
   recommendation of similar datasets and provide competitive performance
   compared to other widely used techniques.}},

   and service robots}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},

Abstract = {{Scientific competitions are becoming more common in many research areas
   of artificial intelligence and robotics, since they provide a shared
   testbed for comparing different solutions and enable the exchange of
   research results: Moreover, they are interesting for general audiences
   and industries. Currently, many major research areas in artificial
   intelligence and robotics are organizing multiple-year competitions that
   are typically associated with scientific conferences.
   One important aspect of such competitions is that they are organized for
   many years. This introduces a temporal evolution that is interesting to
   analyze. However, the problem of evaluating a competition over many
   years remains unaddressed. We believe that this issue is critical to
   properly fuel changes over the years and measure the results of these
   decisions. Therefore, this article focuses on the analysis and the
   results of evolving competitions.
   In this article, we present the ROBOCUP@HOME competition, which is the
   largest worldwide competition for domestic service robots, and evaluate
   its progress over the past seven years. We show how the definition of a
   proper scoring system allows for desired functionalities to be related
   to tasks and how the resulting analysis fuels subsequent changes to
   achieve general and robust solutions implemented by the teams. Our
   results show not only the steadily increasing complexity of the tasks
   that ROBOCUP@HOME robots can solve but also the increased performance
   for all of the functionalities addressed in the competition.
   We believe that the methodology used in ROBOCUP@HOME for evaluating
   competition advances and for stimulating changes can be applied and
   extended to other robotic competitions as well as to multi-year research
   projects involving Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Currently, visual inspection is performed in order to evaluate damage in
   structures. This approach is affected by the constraints of time and the
   availability of qualified personnel. Thus, new approaches to damage
   identification that provide faster and more accurate results are
   pursued. A promising approach to damage evaluation and detection
   utilizes artificial neural networks (ANNs) in solving these two
   problems. ANNs are a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) technique
   that have received wide acceptance in predicting the extent and location
   of damage in structures. In this study, the fundamental strategy for
   developing ANNs to predict the severity and location of double-point
   damage cases from the measured data of the dynamic behavior of the
   structure in I-beam structures is considered. ANNs are trained using
   vibration data consisting of natural frequencies and mode shapes
   obtained from experimental modal analysis and finite element simulations
   of intact and damaged I-beam structures. By using ANNs, some significant
   problems of conventional damage identification approaches can be
   overcome and damage detection accuracy can be improved. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Theory of constraints (TOC) has emerged as an effective management
   philosophy suggesting practical solutions to various complex problems
   including product mix problem. Scholars have shown the superiority of
   various optimization (and artificial intelligence) approaches over the
   TOC-based heuristic to a ``static{''} product mix problem, but have
   failed to see TOC as a whole, i.e. to take into consideration the impact
   of resource inter-dependencies, feedback loops, and importantly,
   statistical fluctuations ever present in any dynamic business
   environment. We proposed a system dynamics (SD.) based simulation model
   to investigate product-mix problem under stochastic demand and scrap
   rates. We analyzed various scenarios by employing the drum-buffer-rope
   approach and constraint focused systematic scrap rate reduction
   approach, and importantly, evaluating performance using throughput
   accounting based global measures such as throughput and inventory. We
   conclude this paper by suggesting that future research efforts should be
   directed to develop an enabling hybrid expert simulation system to learn
   fundamental and powerful concepts underlying the theory of constraints.

   identify and analyze the complete spectrum of compromise aggregation
   operators that can be used to model the various attitudes that
   decision-making agents can have toward risk in aggregation. In this
   paper, we extend these operators to deal with aggregation when the
   ratings have different degrees of importance. Specifically, we
   generalize the method of weighted uninorms to handle this issue. We
   choose this approach because uninorm compromise operators are a kind of
   common ones, and their weighted counterparts, which are widely accepted,
   can cover other common operators, such as weighted t-norms and
   t-conorms, as special cases. As per the analysis of weighted uninorms,
   we identify common properties that the weighting operators of the
   various compromise operators should satisfy, and in so doing, we
   introduce the concept of a general weighting operator for compromise
   operators and reveal the different properties that a specific type of
   weighting operator should obey. This, in turn, defines the concepts of
   the various weighting operators of the various compromise operators. We
   then go onto discuss the construction issue of weighting operators
   associated with the various compromise operators.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{233-244}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A new hybrid assembly line design, called parallel U-shaped assembly
   line system, is introduced and characterised along with numerical
   examples for the first time. Different from existing studies on U-shaped
   lines, we combine the advantages of two individual line configurations
   (namely parallel lines and U-shaped lines) and create an opportunity for
   assigning tasks to multi-line workstations located in between two
   adjacent U-shaped lines with the aim of maximising resource utilisation.
   Utilisation of crossover workstations, in which tasks from opposite
   areas of a same U-shaped line can be performed, is also one of the main
   advantages of the U-shaped lines. As in traditional U-shaped line
   configurations, the newly proposed line configuration also supports the
   utilisation of crossover workstations. An efficient heuristic algorithm
   is developed to find well-balanced solutions for the proposed line
   configurations. Test cases derived from existing studies and modified in
   accordance with the proposed system in this study are solved using the
   proposed heuristic algorithm. The comparison of results obtained when
   the lines are balanced independently and when the lines are balanced
   together (in parallel to each other) clearly indicates that the
   parallelisation of U-shaped lines helps decrease the need for workforce
   significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An important goal in both artificial life and biology is uncovering the
   most general principles underlying life, which might catalyze both our
   understanding of life and engineering lifelike machines. While many such
   general principles have been hypothesized, conclusively testing them is
   difficult because life on Earth provides only a singular example from
   which to infer. To circumvent this limitation, this article formalizes
   an approach called radical reimplementation. The idea is to investigate
   an abstract biological hypothesis by intentionally reimplementing its
   main principles to diverge maximally from existing natural examples. If
   the reimplementation successfully exhibits properties resembling
   biology, it may support the underlying hypothesis better than an
   alternative example inspired more directly by nature. The approach
   thereby provides a principled alternative to a common tradition of
   defending and minimizing deviations from nature in artificial life. This
   work reviews examples that can be interpreted through the lens of
   radical reimplementation to yield potential insights into biology
   despite having purposely unnatural experimental setups. In this way,
   radical reimplementation can help renew the relevance of computational
   systems for investigating biological theory and can act as a practical
   philosophical tool to help separate the fundamental features of
   terrestrial biology from the epiphenomenal.}},

Abstract = {{We present a robotic platform based on the open source RepRap 3D printer
   that can print and maintain chemical artificial life in the form of a
   dynamic, chemical droplet. The robot uses computer vision, a
   self-organizing map, and a learning program to automatically categorize
   the behavior of the droplet that it creates. The robot can then use this
   categorization to autonomously detect the current state of the droplet
   and respond. The robot is programmed to visually track the droplet and
   either inject more chemical fuel to sustain a motile state or introduce
   a new chemical component that results in a state change (e.g.,
   division). Coupling inexpensive open source hardware with sensing and
   feedback allows for replicable real-time manipulation and monitoring of
   nonequilibrium systems that would be otherwise tedious, expensive, and
   error-prone. This system is a first step towards the practical
   confluence of chemical, artificial intelligence, and robotic approaches
   to artificial life.}},

Abstract = {{Learning Management Systems (LMSs) under blended (b-) learning modality
   can efficiently support Online Learning Environments (OLEs) at Higher
   Education Institutions (HEIs). Mining of LMS users' data, involving
   artificial intelligence and incertitude modeling, e.g., via fuzzy logic,
   is a fundamental challenge. This study addresses the hypothesis that the
   structural characteristics of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can
   efficiently model the way LMS users interact with it, by estimating
   their Quality of Interaction (QoI) within a b-learning context. This
   study introduces the FCM-QoI model (combined with a model visualizer)
   consisting of 14 input-one output concepts, dependences and trends,
   considering one academic year of the LMS use from 75 professors and 1037
   students at a HEI. The experimental findings have shown that the
   proposed FCM-QoI model can provide concepts interconnection and causal
   dependencies representation of Moodie LMS users' QoI, revealing
   perspectives of its evolution both at a micro and macro analysis level.
   Moreover, the FCM-QoI model significantly adds to the evaluation and
   analysis of the QoI influential concepts' contribution to self-sustained
   cycles (static analysis) and their alterations, when the time period of
   the LMS use is considered (dynamic analysis), showing potential to
   increase the flexibility and adaptivity of the QoI modeling and feedback
   approaches. Clearly, based on the FCM-QoI model, pedagogical instructors
   and decision-makers of HEls could be assisted to holistically visualize,
   understand and assess OLEs stakeholders' needs within the teaching and
   learning practices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is an important research subject for the fields of cybernetics,
   robotics and artificial intelligence science that on the basis of
   neurophysiology and neuroanatomy, simulates and replicates the
   cerebellar sensorimotor control system for the robots. Around this theme
   and based on Hoff and Arbib's control theory of the minimum jerk, this
   paper presents a new control model with cerebellar-like structure which
   can account for the temporal coordination of arm transport and hand
   preshape during reach and grasp tasks. And it has also been suggested
   that how the structure could learn the two key functions required in the
   Hoff-Arbib theory, namely state look-ahead and TTG (time-to-go)
   estimation. By the simulation for two-dimensional motion of arm
   transport and hand preshape, the results demonstrate that some key
   features of human reach-grasp kinematics obtained by Hoff-Arbib model
   can be achieved by the cerebellum control model and some performances
   are even better. In a word, by learning and training, the model can
   obtain the accurate smooth motor trajectory. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Deployment of Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) in the United States
   transmission grid has brought a new data stream to be processed and an
   opportunity to improve situational awareness on the grid. This new data
   stream offers opportunity for a faster detection and response algorithm
   to minimize wide spread outages. High rate of data collection of PMU
   systems has also brought a challenge on how to extract information from
   fast moving PMU data stream in real time to improve situational
   awareness inside a control room. Despite the fact that mathematical and
   probabilistic methods are the most accurate methods of stability
   analysis, online decision making algorithms cannot afford the latency
   brought by those methods. Traditional batch processing Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) techniques have been extensively studied as potential
   replacements for these approaches, however conventional AI techniques do
   not deal with continuous streams of fast moving phasor data. This paper
   presented a novel application of the stream mining algorithms for
   synchrophasor data to meet quick decision making requirement of future
   situational awareness applications in power systems. To prove that the
   proposed methods are efficient and capable of handling huge amounts of
   data with reasonable accuracy and within limited resources of memory and
   computational power, four different experiments with different
   conditions (changing/unchanging the load conditions of Real Power and
   Reactive Power, fixing the size of memory, and comparing the performance
   of non-adaptive Hoeffding tree with traditional decision tree
   algorithms) were conducted. The algorithms discussed in this paper
   support decisions inside the control rooms helping stakeholders make
   informed decisions to improve reliability of the future smart grid. (C)

Journal = {{Computer Networks}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{196-224}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio (CR) is the next-generation wireless communication
   system that allows unlicensed users (or secondary users, SUs) to exploit
   the underutilized spectrum (or white spaces) in licensed spectrum while
   minimizing interference to licensed users (or primary users, PUs). This
   article proposes a SpectruM-Aware clusteR-based rouTing (SMART) scheme
   that enables SUs to form clusters in a cognitive radio network (CRN) and
   enables each SU source node to search for a route to its destination
   node on the clustered network. An intrinsic characteristic of CRNs is
   the dynamicity of operating environment in which network conditions
   (i.e., PUs' activities) change as time goes by. Based on the network
   conditions, SMART enables SUs to adjust the number of common channels in
   a cluster through cluster merging and splitting, and searches for a
   route on the clustered network using an artificial intelligence approach
   called reinforcement learning. Simulation results show that SMART
   selects stable routes and significantly reduces interference to PUs, as
   well as routing overhead in terms of route discovery frequency, without
   significant degradation of throughput and end-to-end delay. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The demand for better intrusion detection systems, especially anomaly
   intrusion detection, increases daily, as new attacks arise and Internet
   speeds increase. The criterion for a good intrusion detection system is
   to detect emerging attacks with high accuracy at line rates. Existing
   systems suffer from high false positives and negatives, and are unable
   to handle increasing traffic rates. This paper applies artificial bee
   colony for anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. In addition, it
   uses two feature selection techniques to reduce the amount of data used
   for detection and classification. KDD Cup 99 dataset was used to
   evaluate the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that
   artificial bee colony achieves average accuracy rate of 97.5\% for known
   attacks and 93.2\% overall for known and unknown attacks. The new
   algorithm outperforms all methods reported in the literature. Copyright

Abstract = {{An intelligent method is proposed in this study to predict one-day-ahead
   hourly photovoltaic (PV) power generation. The proposed method comprises
   data classification, training, forecasting and forecasting updating
   stages. In the first stage, a fuzzy k-means algorithm is used to
   classify the historical data of daily PV power generation into various
   weather types. In the second stage, five training models are
   established, according to the verbal weather forecast of the Taiwan
   Central Weather Bureau (TCWB), in terms such as the sunny, sunny and
   cloudy, cloudy, cloudy and rainy and rainy. Each training model is
   constructed using a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), for
   which the parameters of each RBFNN, including the position of the radial
   basis function (RBF) centres, the width of the RBFs and the weights
   between the hidden and the output layers, are optimised using a harmony
   search algorithm (HSA). In the forecasting stage, fuzzy inference is
   used to select an adequate forecasting model from the trained models. To
   cope with the possible fluctuation of PV power generation, the forecasts
   are updated every 3 h, according to the updated weather forecasts of the
   TCWB. The proposed approach is tested on a practical PV power generation
   system. The results show that the proposed method provides better
   forecasting results than the existing methods over 1-year testing data.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the condition monitoring of high voltage equipment
   (HVE) and risk assessment in transmission power systems. Artificial
   intelligence is applied to use the currently available information to
   calculate operational risk, and take appropriate operational measures to
   deal with the upcoming system states. The study presents a method based
   on the thermographic approach for determining urgency of intervention of
   HVE. Age of the HVE, voltage level, overheating temperature of the hot
   spot, temperature of the previous overheating, dissolved gas analysis,
   frequency response analysis, temperature of oil insulation, the number
   and time of operations and gas leaking have been used as the reference
   inputs for the designed fuzzy controller. The results of such methods
   have been combined with economic factors and applied in risk maps. The
   method of minimal paths and method of minimal cross-section are modified
   to use fuzzy numbers. These methods are used to analyse the performance
   of high voltage substations. System performance index is calculated to
   make a proper decision about reconfiguration and maintenance planning.
   The results might serve as a good orientation in the HVE condition
   monitoring and they are implemented in the asset management of
   transmission power systems using risk map.}},

Abstract = {{A computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system for effective and accurate
   pulmonary nodule detection is required to detect the nodules at early
   stage. This paper proposed a novel technique to detect and classify
   pulmonary nodules based on statistical features for intensity values
   using support vector machine (SVM). The significance of the proposed
   technique is, it uses the nodules features in 2D \& 3D and also SVM for
   the classification that is good to classify the nodules extracted from
   the image. The lung volume is extracted from Lung CT using thresholding,
   background removal, hole-filling and contour correction of lung lobe.
   The candidate nodules are extracted and pruned using the rules based on
   ground truth of nodules. The statistical features for intensity values
   are extracted from candidate nodules. The nodule data are up-samples to
   reduce the biasness. The classifier SVM is trained using data samples.
   The efficiency of proposed CAD system is tested and evaluated using Lung
   Image Consortium Database (LIDC) that is standard data-set used in CAD
   Systems for Lungs Nodule classification. The results obtained from
   proposed CAD system are good as compare to previous CAD systems. The
   sensitivity of 96.31\% is achieved in the proposed CAD system.}},

Abstract = {{The scour depth that develops around bridge piers is known to be related
   to flow intensity, particle size of bed sediment, and pier dimensions.
   Earlier approaches to this issue have mainly relied on empirical
   formulas. Even numerical simulations have not been so successful due to
   problems associated with interactions between water flow and streambed
   morphology. This necessitates the application of an artificial
   intelligence (AI)-type approach to understanding the effects of local
   scour around bridge piers. Although previous studies reported that
   AI-based models are better predictors, they do not predict field-scale
   local scour well. Motivated by this, the present study reports on the
   use of data quality assessment with an artificial neural network (ANN)
   model for predicting field-scale scour depth around bridge piers. Both
   univariate and multivariate methods were applied and the predicted
   results are compared. For the multivariate method, the Euclidean
   distance method and Mahalanobis distance method were used and the
   predicted results are compared. The ANN model was first trained and
   validated using laboratory data and the model was applied to data
   obtained in laboratory experiments. The model was then applied to field
   data. Quantitative descriptions are given on how much the data quality
   assessment improves predictions based on the use of the ANN model.}},

   artificial intelligences are developed in order to be used for a
   specific purpose within a particular software. However, this paper
   stands as the first step of a research in progress whose final objective
   is to design an artificial intelligence adjustable to every types of
   problems without any modification in its source code. The present work
   focuses on a framework of such an artificial intelligence and is
   conducted in the context of video games. This framework, composed of
   three layers, would be re-usable for all types of game.}},

Abstract = {{Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is an important technique in artificial
   intelligence, which has been applied to various kinds of problems in a
   wide range of domains. Selecting case representation formalism is
   critical for the proper operation of the overall CBR system. In this
   paper, we survey and evaluate all of the existing case representation
   methodologies. Moreover, the case retrieval and future challenges for
   effective CBR are explained. Case representation methods are grouped in
   to knowledge-intensive approaches and traditional approaches. The first
   group overweight the second one. The first methods depend on ontology
   and enhance all CBR processes including case representation, retrieval,
   storage, and adaptation. By using a proposed set of qualitative metrics,
   the existing methods based on ontology for case representation are
   studied and evaluated in details. All these systems have limitations. No
   approach exceeds 53\% of the specified metrics. The results of the
   survey explain the current limitations of CBR systems. It shows that
   ontology usage in case representation needs improvements to achieve
   semantic representation and semantic retrieval in CBR system.}},

Abstract = {{The authors of this article deals with the implementation of a
   combination of techniques of the fuzzy system and artificial
   intelligence in the application area of non-linear noise and
   interference suppression. This stricture used is called an Adaptive
   Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). This system finds practical use
   mainly in audio telephone (mobile) communication in a noisy environment
   (transport, production halls, sports matches, etc). Experimental methods
   based on the two-input adaptive noise cancellation concept was dearly
   outlined. Within the experiments carried out, the authors created, based
   on the ANFIS structure., a comprehensive system for adaptive suppression
   of unwanted background interference that occurs in audio communication
   and degrades the audio signal. The system designed has been tested on
   real voice signals. This article presents the investigation and
   comparison amongst three distinct approaches to noise cancellation in
   speech; they are LMS (least mean squares) and RLS (recursive least
   squares) adaptive ``filterilig mid ANFIS. A careful review of
   literatures indicated the import once of non-h near adaptive algorithms
   over linear ones in noise cancellation. It was concluded that the AN EIS
   approach had the overall best performance as it efficiently cancelled
   noise even in highly noise-degraded speech. Results were drawn from the
   successful experimentation, subjective-based tests were used to analyse
   their comparative performance while objective tests were used to
   validate them. Implementation of algorithms was experimentally carried
   out in Matlab to justify the claims and determine their relative
   performances.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, several modeling approaches have been proposed and
   applied to estimate the high-performance concrete (HPC) slump flow.
   While HPC is a highly complex material, modeling its behavior is a very
   difficult issue. Thus, the selection and application of proper modeling
   methods remain therefore a crucial task. Like many other applications,
   HPC slump flow prediction suffers from noise which negatively affects
   the prediction accuracy and increases the variance. In the recent years,
   ensemble learning methods have introduced to optimize the prediction
   accuracy and reduce the prediction error. This study investigates the
   potential usage of bagging (Bag), which is among the most popular
   ensemble learning methods, in building ensemble models. Four well-known
   artificial intelligence models (i.e., classification and regression
   trees CART, support vector machines SVM, multilayer perceptron MLP and
   radial basis function neural networks RBF) are deployed as base learner.
   As a result of this study, bagging ensemble models (i.e., Bag-SVM,
   Bag-RT, Bag-MLP and Bag-RBF) are found superior to their base learners
   (i.e., SVM, CART, MLP and RBF) and bagging could noticeable optimize
   prediction accuracy and reduce the prediction error of proposed
   predictive models.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new multi-objective uniform-diversity differential
   evolution (MUDE) algorithm is proposed and used for Pareto optimum
   design of mechanisms. The proposed algorithm uses a diversity preserving
   mechanism called the epsilon-elimination algorithm to improve the
   population diversity among the obtained Pareto front. The proposed
   algorithm is firstly tested on some constrained and unconstrained
   benchmarks proposed for the special session and competition on
   multi-objective optimizers held under IEEE CEC 2009. The inverted
   generational distance (IGD) measure is used to assess the performance of
   the algorithm. Secondly, the proposed algorithm has been used for
   multi-objective optimization of two different combinatorial case
   studies. The first case contains a two-degree of freedom leg mechanism
   with springs. Three conflicting objective functions that have been
   considered for Pareto optimization are namely, leg size, vertical
   actuating force, and the peak crank torque. The second case is a
   two-finger robot gripper mechanism with two conflicting objectives which
   are the difference between the maximum and minimum-gripping force and
   the transmission ratio of actuated and experienced gripper forces.
   Comparisons of obtained Pareto fronts using the method of this work with
   those obtained in other references show significant improvements.}},

Abstract = {{In last decade, intensive research on emotional intelligence has
   advanced significantly from its theoretical basis, analytical studies
   and processing technology to exploratory applications in a wide range of

   overview of the state-of-the-art in emotional intelligence research with
   emphasis on emotional agents. A wide range of applications in different
   areas like modeling emotional agents, aspects of learning in emotional
   environments, interactive emotional systems and so on are presented.
   After that we suggest a systematic order of research steps with the idea
   of proposing an adequate framework for several possible real-life
   applications of emotional agents. We recognize that it is necessary to
   apply specific methods for dynamic data analysis in order to identify
   and discover new knowledge from available emotional information and data
   sets. The last part of the paper discusses research activities for
   designing an agent-based architecture, in which agents are capable of

Abstract = {{Path-planning is a well-known studied problem in Artificial
   Intelligence. Given two points in a map, path-planning algorithms search
   for a path that joins those two points, avoiding obstacles. It is a
   challenging problem with important practical applications in a wide
   range of applications: autonomous mobile robotics, logistics or video
   games, just to mention some of them. Given its importance, it has
   attracted much research, resulting in a large number of algorithms, some
   classical, such as A{*}, other more specialized, such as swarms.
   However, despite all the literature dedicated to this problem, the
   statistics used to analyze experimental results in most cases are na <
   ve. In this paper, we position in favor of the need of incorporating
   stronger statistical methods in path-planning empirical research and
   promote a debate in the research community. To this end, we analyze some
   2D-grid classical path-planning algorithms in discrete domains (i.e.
   A{*} and A{*} with post-processing) and more recent algorithms in
   continuous domains (i.e. Theta{*} and S-Theta{*}). Given the differences
   of these algorithms, we study them under different criteria: Run-time,
   number of heading changes, number of expanded vertices and path-length.}},

Abstract = {{Multiuser museum interactives are computer systems installed in museums
   or galleries which allow several visitors to interact together with
   digital representations of artefacts and information from the museum's
   collection. In this paper, we describe WeCurate, a socio-technical
   system that supports cobrowsing across multiple devices and enables
   groups of users to collaboratively curate a collection of images,
   through negotiation, collective decision making and voting. The
   engineering of such a system is challenging since it requires to address
   several problems such as: distributed workflow control, collective
   decision making and multiuser synchronous interactions. The system uses
   a peer-to-peer Electronic Institution (El) to manage and execute a
   distributed curation workflow and models community interactions into
   scenes, where users engage in different social activities. Social
   interactions are enacted by intelligent agents that interface the users
   participating in the curation workflow with the El infrastructure. The
   multiagent system supports collective decision making, representing the
   actions of the users within the El, where the agents advocate and
   support the desires of their users e.g. aggregating opinions for
   deciding which images are interesting enough to be discussed, and
   proposing interactions and resolutions between disagreeing group
   members. Throughout the paper, we describe the enabling technologies of
   WeCurate, the peer-to-peer El infrastructure, the agent collective
   decision making capabilities and the multi-modal interface. We present a
   system evaluation based on data collected from cultural exhibitions in
   which WeCurate was used as supporting multiuser interactive. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Each year, more than 400 natural disasters hit the world. To be more
   responsive, humanitarians organize stocks of relief items. It is an
   issue to know the quantity of items to be stored and where they should
   be positioned. Many authors have tried to address this issue both in
   industrial and humanitarian environments. However, humanitarian supply
   chains today do not perform correctly, particularly as regards
   resilience and efficiency. This is mainly due to the fact that when a
   disaster occurs, some hazards can strongly impact the network by
   destroying some resources or collapsing infrastructure. The expected
   performance of the relief response is consequently strongly decreased.
   The problem statement of our research work consists in proposing a
   decision-making support model in artificial intelligence dedicated to
   the humanitarian world and capable of designing a coherent network that
   is still able to adequately manage the response to a disaster despite
   failures or inadequacies of infrastructure and potential resources. This
   contribution is defined through a Stochastic Multi-Scenarios Program as
   a core and a set of extensions. A real-life application case based on
   the design of a humanitarian supply chain in Peru is developed in order
   to highlight the benefits and limits of the proposition. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the methods in decision-support systems for crisis

   constructing an intelligent decision-support system for crisis response
   management. A novel framework for crisis response decision-making system
   under the assumption of openness to various kinds of uncertainties,
   reasoning and learning with real-time response is proposed. We applied
   the Non-Axiomatic Logic in representing and reasoning the uncertainty
   knowledge in the framework and demonstrated the reasoning and learning
   mechanisms of the framework through an application in a case study in
   the field of urban firefighting. The results show that the framework

   spectra, which exploits artificial intelligence and offers the advantage
   of global optimization. Because the scattering effect is considered when
   the fitness function is established, almost all of the quantitative
   errors are below 2\%. Furthermore, optimal values of the crossover and
   mutation probabilities were selected considering their effects on the
   quantitative error and time used. The GA was found to be superior to the
   least-squares method for quantitative analysis of mixtures using their
   terahertz absorption spectra because of its excellent nonlinear
   discrimination ability and higher accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Drive cycle identification and future energy demand prediction are
   advantageous when developing hybrid propulsion systems. They are
   applicable to vehicles that are driven along the same route every day,
   such as busses, refuse-collecting vehicles (RCVs), or delivery vehicles.
   Drive cycle identification can be used to identify what power transients
   can be expected to prepare the power train to operate under these
   conditions. If the energy management algorithm of a hybrid vehicle can
   account for future energy demand, then it can be arranged in such a way
   that the non-fossil-fuel energy sources are fully depleted at the end of
   the drive cycle. Given that RCVs always drive in similar drive cycles, a
   drive cycle has been modeled and its main characteristics parameterized.
   The model is separated into different drive cycles that are related to
   different power consumption modes. In this paper, a new method to
   identify drive cycles and the energy left to finish a route is proposed.
   The drive cycle identification is based on artificial intelligence
   algorithms, which have been trained and tested with real data with an
   average efficiency in drive cycle identification of over 90\%. The
   energy necessary to finish the route is based on vehicle energy models
   and statistical analysis. This method can be used in the daily
   management of fleet vehicles to replace fossil fuel by electric energy,
   as is demonstrated in the proposed examples.}},

Abstract = {{Current challenges demand a profound restructuration of the global
   healthcare system. A more efficient system is required to cope with the
   growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is
   associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders
   such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this
   demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of
   Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually
   in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's
   clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices
   such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge
   amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also
   at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into
   intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening
   conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical
   deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A
   major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing
   resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient
   participates actively in disease management via combined objective
   device-and self-assessment and by sharing information within both
   medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing
   wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD,
   with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift
   in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new acoustic emission (AE) sensor-based planetary
   gearbox (PGB) fault diagnosis method is presented. The method includes a
   heterodyne-based AE data acquisition system, empirical mode
   decomposition (EMD)-based AE signal analysis method, and computation of
   condition indicators (CIs) for PGB fault diagnosis. The heterodyne
   technique is hardware-implemented to downshift the sampling frequency of
   AE signals at a rate compatible to vibration analysis. The sampled AE
   signals are processed using EMD to extract PGB fault features and
   compute the CIs. The CIs are input into supervised learning algorithms
   for PGB fault diagnosis. The method is validated on a set of seeded
   localised faults on all gears: sun gear, planetary gear, and ring gear.
   The validation results have shown a promising PGB fault diagnostic
   performance using the presented method.}},

Abstract = {{Ball bearings are considered as a critical element in various mechanical
   systems. Vibration signal analysis is very effective method for finding
   bearing fault. Accelerometers are used to capture the multi-component
   vibration signal generated in the machine when it is in use. Various
   methods based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) have been used for
   ball bearing fault diagnosis. EMD method usually suffered from the
   boundary distortion of intrinsic mode function. Classification of ball
   bearing fault is one of the challenging tasks in the field of mechanical
   systems. Various classification schemes such as support vector machine
   (SVM), K-means clustering, extreme learning machine (ELM) have been used
   for the classification of ball bearing fault. In this study, footprint
   analysis of Hilbert transform along with the neural network has been
   done for ball bearing fault analysis. A comparative analysis of the
   proposed research study has been done with available methods such as SVM
   and ELM. A high fault classification accuracy has been achieved using
   the proposed method for detection of ball bearing fault.}},

   behavior. A unique aspect of this architecture is to include a
   distributed inductive engine for learning the local dynamics of
   generators and loads in the micro-grid. It generates feedback laws that
   are adapted to the current status of the micro-grid, and responds to
   anomalous events in a resilient manner. An important novelty is that
   control laws are extracted online for bidirectional discontinuous
   nonlinear loads by mean field methods from physics outside the standard
   design methodologies for piecewise linear quadratic controls.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The main objective of the metamodelling is replacing the model of
   analysed process by its simple (with respect to the computation time)
   approximation. Metamodel gives a significant reduction of computation
   time of considered process simulation, as well as its further analysis
   (sensitivity analysis, optimization, etc.). The paper discusses the idea
   of metamodelling and compares the effectiveness of three techniques:
   Response Surface Methodology (RSM), Kriging method and Artificial Neural
   Network (ANN) applied to the benchmark functions. An example of the use
   of the considered metamodelling techniques in optimization of the
   problem of laminar cooling of rolled Dual Phase (DP) steel strips is
   presented. Metamodelling and optimization of a real industrial metal
   forming problems seems a novel approach in the field of research on

   in electricity markets}},
Journal = {{DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The energy sector has suffered a significant restructuring that has
   increased the complexity in electricity market players' interactions.
   The complexity that these changes brought requires the creation of
   decision support tools to facilitate the study and understanding of
   these markets. The Multiagent Simulator of Competitive Electricity
   Markets (MASCEM) arose in this context, providing a simulation framework
   for deregulated electricity markets. The Adaptive Learning strategic
   Bidding System (ALBidS) is a multiagent system created to provide
   decision support to market negotiating players. Fully integrated with
   MASCEM, ALBidS considers several different strategic methodologies based
   on highly distinct approaches. Six Thinking Hats (STH) is a powerful
   technique used to look at decisions from different perspectives, forcing
   the thinker to move outside its usual way of thinking. This paper aims
   to complement the ALBidS strategies by combining them and taking
   advantage of their different perspectives through the use of the STH
   group decision technique. The combination of ALBidS' strategies is
   performed through the application of a genetic algorithm, resulting in
   an evolutionary learning approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Emulating the human brain is one of the core challenges of computational
   intelligence, which entails many key problems of artificial
   intelligence, including understanding human language, reasoning, and
   emotions. In this work, computational intelligence techniques are
   combined with common-sense computing and linguistics to analyze
   sentiment data flows, i.e., to automatically decode how humans express
   emotions and opinions via natural language. The increasing availability
   of social data is extremely beneficial for tasks such as branding,
   product positioning, corporate reputation management, and social media
   marketing. The elicitation of useful information from this huge amount
   of unstructured data, however, remains an open challenge. Although such
   data are easily accessible to humans, they are not suitable for
   automatic processing: machines are still unable to effectively and
   dynamically interpret the meaning associated with natural language text
   in very large, heterogeneous, noisy, and ambiguous environments such as
   the Web. We present a novel methodology that goes beyond mere word-level
   analysis of text and enables a more efficient transformation of
   unstructured social data into structured information, readily
   interpretable by machines. In particular, we describe a novel paradigm
   for real-time concept-level sentiment analysis that blends computational
   intelligence, linguistics, and common-sense computing in order to
   improve the accuracy of computationally expensive tasks such as polarity
   detection from big social data. The main novelty of the paper consists
   in an algorithm that assigns contextual polarity to concepts in text and
   flows this polarity through the dependency arcs in order to assign a
   final polarity label to each sentence. Analyzing how sentiment flows
   from concept to concept through dependency relations allows for a better
   understanding of the contextual role of each concept in text, to achieve
   a dynamic polarity inference that outperforms state-of-the-art
   statistical methods in terms of both accuracy and training time.}},

Abstract = {{We present a preliminary framework for reasoning with possibilistic
   description logics ontologies with disjunctive assertions (PoDLoDA
   ontologies for short). Given a PoDLoDA ontology, its terminological box
   is expressed in the description logic programming fragment but its
   assertional box allows four kinds of statements: an individual is a
   member of a concept, two individuals are related through a role, an
   individual is a member of the union of two or more concepts or two
   individuals are related through the union of two or more roles. Axioms
   and statements in PoDLoDA ontologies have a numerical certainty degree
   attached. A disjunctive assertion expresses a doubt respect to the
   membership of either individuals to union of concepts or pairs of
   individuals to the union of roles. Because PoDLoDA ontologies allow to
   represent incomplete and potentially inconsistent information, instance
   checking is addressed through an adaptation of Bodanza's Suppositional
   Argumentation System that allows to reason with modus ponens and
   constructive dilemmas. We think that our approach will be of use for
   implementers of reasoning systems in the Semantic Web where uncertainty
   of membership of individuals to concepts or roles is present.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical Relational AI-the science and engineering of making
   intelligent machines acting in noisy worlds composed of objects and
   relations among the objects-is currently motivating a lot of new AI
   research and has tremendous theoretical and practical implications.
   Theoretically, combining logic and probability in a unified
   representation and building general-purpose reasoning tools for it has
   been the dream of AI, dating back to the late 1980s. Practically,
   successful statistical relational AI tools enable new applications in
   several large, complex realworld domains including those involving big
   data, natural text, social networks, the web, medicine and robotics,
   among others. Such domains are often characterized by rich relational
   structure and large amounts of uncertainty. Logic helps to faithfully
   model the former while probability helps to effectively manage the
   latter. Our intention here is to give a brief (and necessarily
   incomplete) overview and invitation to the emerging field of Statistical
   Relational AI from the perspective of acting optimally and learning to
   act.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{With over 50 billion downloads and more than 1.3 million apps in
   Google's official market, Android has continued to gain popularity among
   smartphone users worldwide. At the same time there has been a rise in
   malware targeting the platform, with more recent strains employing
   highly sophisticated detection avoidance techniques. As traditional
   signature-based methods become less potent in detecting unknown malware,
   alternatives are needed for timely zero-day discovery. Thus, this study
   proposes an approach that utilises ensemble learning for Android malware
   detection. It combines advantages of static analysis with the efficiency
   and performance of ensemble machine learning to improve Android malware
   detection accuracy. The machine learning models are built using a large
   repository of malware samples and benign apps from a leading antivirus
   vendor. Experimental results and analysis presented shows that the
   proposed method which uses a large feature space to leverage the power
   of ensemble learning is capable of 97.3-99\% detection accuracy with
   very low false positive rates.}},

Abstract = {{Data mining is the process of determining new, unanticipated, valuable
   patterns from existing databases by considering historical and recent
   developments in statistics, artificial intelligence, and machine
   learning. It can help companies focus on the most important information
   in their data warehouses. Association rule mining is one of the most
   highly researched and popular data mining techniques for finding
   associations between items in a set. It is frequently used in marketing,
   advertising, and inventory control. Typically, association rules only
   consider items in transactions (positive association rules). They do not
   consider items that do not occur together, which can be used to create
   rules that are also useful for market basket analysis. Also, existing
   algorithms often generate too many candidate itemsets when mining the
   data and scan the database multiple times. To resolve these issues in
   association rule mining algorithms, we propose SARIC (set particle swarm
   optimization for association rules using the itemset range and
   correlation coefficient). Our method uses set particle swarm
   optimization to generate association rules from a database and considers
   both positive and negative occurrences of attributes. SARIC applies the
   itemset range and correlation coefficient so that we do not need to
   specify the minimum support and confidence, because it automatically
   determines them quickly and objectively. We verified the efficiency of
   SARIC using two differently sized databases. Our simulation results
   demonstrate that SARIC generates more promising results than Apriori,
   Eclat, HMINE, and a genetic algorithm.}},

Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{228}},
Pages = {{95-128}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying semantic similarity between linguistic items lies at the
   core of many applications in Natural Language Processing and Artificial
   Intelligence. It has therefore received a considerable amount of
   research interest, which in its turn has led to a wide range of
   approaches for measuring semantic similarity. However, these measures
   are usually limited to handling specific types of linguistic item, e.g.,
   single word senses or entire sentences. Hence, for a downstream
   application to handle various types of input, multiple measures of
   semantic similarity are needed, measures that often use different
   internal representations or have different output scales. In this
   article we present a unified graph-based approach for measuring semantic
   similarity which enables effective comparison of linguistic items at
   multiple levels, from word senses to full texts. Our method first
   leverages the structural properties of a semantic network in order to
   model arbitrary linguistic items through a unified probabilistic
   representation, and then compares the linguistic items in terms of their
   representations. We report state-of-the-art performance on multiple
   datasets pertaining to three different levels: senses, words, and texts.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a joint segmentation and classification
   framework for sentence-level sentiment classification. It is widely
   recognized that phrasal information is crucial for sentiment
   classification. However, existing sentiment classification algorithms
   typically split a sentence as a word sequence, which does not
   effectively handle the inconsistent sentiment polarity between a phrase
   and the words it contains, such as \{{''}not bad,{''} ``bad{''}\} and
   \{{''}a great deal of,{''} ``great{''}\}. We address this issue by
   developing a joint framework for sentence-level sentiment
   classification. It simultaneously generates useful segmentations and
   predicts sentence-level polarity based on the segmentation results.
   Specifically, we develop a candidate generation model to produce
   segmentation candidates of a sentence; a segmentation ranking model to
   score the usefulness of a segmentation candidate for sentiment
   classification; and a classification model for predicting the sentiment
   polarity of a segmentation. We train the joint framework directly from
   sentences annotated with only sentiment polarity, without using any
   syntactic or sentiment annotations in segmentation level. We conduct
   experiments for sentiment classification on two benchmark datasets: a
   tweet dataset and a review dataset. Experimental results show that: 1)
   our method performs comparably with state-of-the-art methods on both
   datasets; 2) joint modeling segmentation and classification outperforms
   pipelined baseline methods in various experimental settings.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{269-282}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Corneal images can be acquired using confocal microscopes which provide
   detailed views of the different layers inside a human cornea. Some
   corneal problems and diseases can occur in one or more of the main
   corneal layers: the epithelium, stroma and endothelium. Consequently,
   for automatically extracting clinical information associated with
   corneal diseases, identifying abnormality or evaluating the normal
   cornea, it is important to be able to automatically recognise these
   layers reliably. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches can provide
   improved accuracy over the conventional processing techniques and save a
   useful amount of time over the manual analysis time required by clinical
   experts. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), adaptive neuro fuzzy
   inference systems (ANFIS) and a committee machine (CM) have been
   investigated and tested to improve the recognition accuracy of the main
   corneal layers and identify abnormality in these layers. The performance
   of the CM, formed from ANN and ANFIS, achieves an accuracy of 100\% for
   some classes in the processed data sets. Three normal corneal data sets
   and seven abnormal corneal images associated with diseases in the main
   corneal layers have been investigated with the proposed system.
   Statistical analysis for these data sets is performed to track any
   change in the processed images. This system is able to pre-process
   (quality enhancement, noise removal), classify corneal images, identify
   abnormalities in the analysed data sets and visualise corneal stroma
   images as well as each individual keratocyte cell in a 3D volume for
   further clinical analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to technological improvements, the number and volume of datasets are
   considerably increasing and bring about the need for additional memory
   and computational complexity. To work with massive datasets in an
   efficient way; feature selection, data reduction, rule based and
   exemplar based methods have been introduced. This study presents a
   method, which may be called joint generalized exemplar (JGE), for
   classification of massive data sets. This method aims to enhance the
   computational performance of NGE by working against nesting and
   overlapping of hyper-rectangles with reassessing the overlapping parts
   with the same procedure repeatedly and joining non-overlapped
   hyper-rectangle sections that falling within the same class. This
   provides an opportunity to have adaptive decision boundaries, and also
   employing batch data searching instead of incremental searching. Later,
   the classification was done in accordance with the distance between each
   particular query and generalized exemplars. The accuracy and time
   requirements for classification of synthetic datasets and a benchmark
   dataset obtained by JGE, NGE and other popular machine learning methods
   were compared and the achieved results by JGE found acceptable. (C) 2015

Pages = {{641-655}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Electrocardiogram is the most commonly used tool for the diagnosis of
   cardiologic diseases. In order to help cardiologists to diagnose the
   arrhythmias automatically, new methods for automated, computer aided ECG
   analysis are being developed. In this paper, a Modified Artificial Bee
   Colony (MABC) algorithm for ECG heart beat classification is introduced.
   It is applied to ECG data set which is obtained from MITBIH database and
   the result of MABC is compared with seventeen other classifier's
   accuracy.
   In classification problem, some features have higher distinctiveness
   than others. In this study, in order to find higher distinctive
   features, a detailed analysis has been done on time domain features. By
   using the right features in MABC algorithm, high classification success
   rate (99.30\%) is obtained. Other methods generally have high
   classification accuracy on examined data set, but they have relatively

Abstract = {{Recently, sensors and actuators have quickly spread throughout our
   everyday life. These devices are robust, cheap, accessible, connected to
   the Internet, etc. With the growing needs in terms of human and medical
   resources to help cognitively-impaired people to remain at home,
   researchers are investing in new ways to exploit this technology with
   artificial intelligence, in order to build expert systems to assist the
   residents in their daily activities. Several systems have been proposed
   in the last few years, mostly based on binary sensors, cameras and other
   sensors such as Radio-frequency identification (REID) tags. Cameras are
   very intrusive, binary sensors (such as movement detectors) give only
   basic information, and other types of sensors (such as RFID) need
   complex deployment. In this context, this paper presents a new assistive
   expert system based on electric device identification to address the
   problem of guidance and supervision in the performance of activities for
   people with cognitive disorders living in a smart home. This system is
   solely based on a single power analyzer placed in the electric panel. We
   propose an algorithmic approach used to recognize erratic behaviors
   related to cognitive deficits and provides cues to guide the person in
   the completion of an ongoing task. This is achieved through load
   signatures study of appliances represented by three features (active
   power (P), reactive power (Q) and line-to-neutral), which allows to
   determine the errors committed by the resident. We implemented this
   system within a genuine smart-home prototype equipped with household
   appliances used by the patient during his morning routines. Different
   multimedia prompting devices (iPad, screen, speakers, etc.) were used.
   We tested the system with real-case scenarios modeled from former
   clinical trials, allowing demonstration of accuracy and effectiveness of
   our system in assisting a cognitively-impaired resident in the
   completion of daily activities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{6674-6685}},

Abstract = {{Earthworks involve the leveling or shaping of a target area through the
   moving or processing of the ground surface. Most construction projects
   require earthworks, which are heavily dependent on mechanical equipment
   (e.g., excavators, trucks and compactors). Often, earthworks are the
   most costly and time-consuming component of infrastructure constructions
   (e.g., road, railway and airports) and current pressure for higher
   productivity and safety highlights the need to optimize earthworks,
   which is a non-trivial task. Most previous attempts at tackling this
   problem focus on single-objective optimization of partial processes or
   aspects of earthworks, overlooking the advantages of a multi-objective
   and global optimization. This work describes a novel optimization system
   based on an evolutionary multi-objective approach, capable of globally
   optimizing several objectives simultaneously and dynamically. The
   proposed system views an earthwork construction as a production line,
   where the goal is to optimize resources under two crucial criteria
   (costs and duration) and focus the evolutionary search (non-dominated
   sorting genetic algorithm-II) on compaction allocation, using linear
   programming to distribute the remaining equipment (e.g., excavators).
   Several experiments were held using real-world data from a Portuguese
   construction site, showing that the proposed system is quite competitive
   when compared with current manual earthwork equipment allocation. (C)

Title = {{Frontiers for propositional reasoning about fragments of probabilistic

Journal = {{THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{603}},
Pages = {{111-131}},

Abstract = {{Conditional independence provides an essential framework to deal with
   knowledge and uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, and is fundamental
   in probability and multivariate statistics. Its associated implication
   problem is paramount for building Bayesian networks. Unfortunately, the
   problem does not enjoy an axiomatization, by a finite set of Horn rules,
   and is already coNP-complete to decide for some fragments of conditional
   independencies. Saturated conditional independencies form an important
   fragment whose implication problem is decidable in almost linear time.
   We establish an axiomatization, by a finite set of Horn rules, for the
   fragment of generalized saturated conditional independencies. These
   state the conditional independence between finitely many sets of random
   variables. The special case of two sets captures Geiger and Pearl's
   finite axiomatization for saturated conditional independencies. Even for
   this special case, our completeness proof is new. The proof argument
   utilizes special probability models where two events have probability
   one half. Special probability models allow us to establish an
   equivalence between the implication of generalized saturated conditional
   independencies and that of formulae in a Boolean propositional fragment.
   This duality is then extended to a trinity including the implication
   problem of Delobel's full first-order hierarchical database
   decompositions. Already for the independence between two sets of random
   variables, the dualities cannot be extended to cover conditional
   independencies in general, or first-order hierarchical decompositions.

Abstract = {{Utilities typically depend on customers to call and inform them of the
   service interruptions due to outages by entering their addresses. After
   sufficient calls are received, the utility is able to pinpoint the
   location of outages. It is essential for the utility to have a good idea
   on the location of outages before sending crew for restoration work to
   optimally utilize their resources. This article uses an idiotypic immune
   system to model and simulate radial distribution system to identify the
   operated protective devices due to outages. The incoming calls are
   modeled as antigens, and the protective devices are modeled as
   antibodies. Using a differential equation describing dynamics of the
   immune system, the operated protective devices in the network are
   identified. A pre-processing technique is presented to handle cases with
   multiple outages within the same period. Different threshold values for
   call grouping are tested to determine the most suitable values. Several
   real-life examples are considered to demonstrate that the proposed
   method is able to identify the correct protective devices.}},

Abstract = {{The hybrid artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm with differential
   evolution (DE) techniques (HABCwDE) is proposed for numerical
   optimization in this paper. The HABCwDE adopts multiple candidate
   solution generation strategies (CSGSes) from DE techniques to generate
   new solutions in the framework of the ABC algorithm. In the HABCwDE
   algorithm, three CSGSes and three groups of parameter settings are
   employed. The performance of HABCwDE and some other evolutionary
   algorithms are tested on 26 state-of-the-art benchmark functions.
   Experimental results demonstrate that HABCwDE is very competitive, and
   that it is an effective way to improve the performance of ABC algorithm
   by employing CSGSes from DE techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Situated in the wake of the first and second waves of the Digital
   Humanities, the Digital Literary Atlas of Ireland, 1922-1949 website
   provides interactive mapping and timeline features for academics and
   members of the public who are interested in the intersection of Irish
   literary culture, history, and environment. The site hosts Google Earth
   software produced interfaces with the EXHIBIT Timeline functions made
   available by the Semantic Interoperability of Metadata and Information
   in unLike Environments (SIMILE) project, developed and hosted by the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Computer Science and
   Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Library. This paper's
   case study maps the biographical lifepath of the writer Samuel Beckett
   using digital humanities techniques such as ergodicity, and deformance.
   The geodigital-timeline mapping of his biography allows us to visualize
   the shift in Beckett's literary perspective from a latent Cartesian
   verisimilitude to more phenomenological and fragmented, existential
   impressions of time and place. The atlas's visualizations of his
   Wanderjahre years in various European metropoles chart the intellectual
   and aesthetic influences shaping the Beckettian literary landscapes of
   his later and better-known works, such as En Attendant Godot (1953).
   Beckett's thought, works, and shifts in perception provide insight into
   how digital cultural mapping practices and third wave digital humanities
   methodologies and tools can be conceptualized and operationalized.}},

Abstract = {{Endmember extraction (EE) is an important process in hyperspectral image
   processing, and swarm intelligence algorithms have been developed to
   provide effective solutions for EE. However, these algorithms have
   limitations in terms of their calculation efficiency. To increase the
   computing speed of these algorithms by fully utilizing their potential
   parallel nature, this paper uses the artificial bee colony (ABC)
   algorithm to develop a multiagent system (MAS) for extracting endmembers
   from hyperspectral images. In this paper, EE is described as an
   optimization problem that involves the simplex volume and
   root-mean-square error (RMSE), and the ABC algorithm is used to obtain
   the optimal solution to the problem. To accelerate the execution of the
   ABC algorithm, it is incorporated into an established MAS platform that
   provides the advantages of high parallel computing efficiency, flexible
   system architecture, and responsive fault tolerance. Artificial bees and
   food sources, which are the two key components of the ABC algorithm, are
   implemented as standalone software agents. Different agents cooperate
   with each other via communication and produce the optimal solution.
   Comparative experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the
   agent-based ABC approach. The results indicate that the proposed
   agent-based ABC method can effectively solve the EE problem in
   distributive and high-speed computing environments.}},

Abstract = {{Technological developments towards vehicle automation have been taking
   place for years. Satellite navigation, cruise control and anti-lock
   braking systems (ABS) are well-known examples of automation technology
   used in everyday cars. The trend of automation technology being used in
   vehicles is expected to move closer to full autonomy through
   technological advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence. As a
   result, our daily lives will become more and more dependent on
   digitally-controlled devices and vehicle systems (partially or highly
   automated). On the other hand, computing and digital systems also have a
   tendency to become more fragile and susceptible to faults and failures
   because of cyber-attacks and software and hardware defects, as well as
   accidental defects introduced by developers. Therefore, autonomous
   vehicle systems must be developed to bear such dangers in mind and must
   be equipped with defensive capabilities and measures such that they can
   be able to respond automatically and dynamically to both accidental and
   deliberate defects and attacks. In this study, autonomous and unmanned
   vehicle systems are examined for their cyber-security vulnerabilities.
   Threats and attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities are identified and
   classified. Development guidelines and a mitigation strategy to be used
   in the development of autonomous and unmanned vehicle systems are
   proposed and discussed in the final section.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we evaluate citation networks of authors, publications and
   journals, constructed from the 151 Web of Science database (Computer
   Science categories). Our aim was to find a method with which to rank
   authors of scientific papers so that the most important occupy the top
   positions. We utilized a hand-made list of authors, each of whom have
   received an ACM Fellowship or have been awarded by an ACM SIG
   (Artificial Intelligence or Hardware categories). The developed method
   also included the adoption of the PageRank algorithm, which can be
   considered a measure of prestige, as well as other measures of
   significance (h-index, publication count, citation count, publication's
   author count), with these measures analyzed regarding their influence on
   the final rankings.
   Our main objective, to determine whether a better author ranking can be
   obtained using journal values, was achieved. The best of our author
   ranking systems was obtained by using journal impact values in PageRank,
   which was applied to a citation network of publications. The
   effectiveness of the ranking system was confirmed after calculations
   were carried out involving authors who were awarded after the final year
   used in our dataset or who were awarded in selected categories. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The most important meteorological variables influencing plant growth are
   temperature, moisture, and solar radiation. Because it is scarcely
   gauged at meteorological stations in Turkey, solar radiation is commonly
   estimated by artificial neural networks (ANN), adaptive network-fuzzy
   inference system (ANFIS), multiple linear regression (MLR) models, or by
   empirical equations relating it to available meteorological data at
   monthly periods composed differently for each one of 12 months. In
   general, the explanatory meteorological data comprise month number,
   extraterrestrial radiation, average air temperature, average relative
   humidity, average sunshine duration, and daylight hours. Such data
   together with solar radiation measured by the Turkish State
   Meteorological Service (MGM) at 163 stations having records of at least
   20 years are used in monthly units in developing the models. First, as a
   result of a variance inflation factors analysis, calendar month number
   (M), extraterrestrial radiation (R-a), average air temperature (T-mean),
   and average relative humidity (RHmean) are determined to be meaningful
   explanatory variables for estimation of solar radiation. Second, various
   combinations of input variables are dissected using the ANFIS and ANN
   models. Next, the accuracies of the ANFIS, ANN, and MLR models, and of
   Angstrom, Abdalla, Bahel, and Hargreaves-Samani empirical equations are
   compared with each other. The final results show that the ANN model
   performs better than the ANFIS and MLR models and the empirical
   equations in estimating solar radiation in Turkey. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Multi-agent based simulation has been widely used in behavior finance,
   and several single-processed simulation platforms with Agent-Based
   Modeling (ABM) have been proposed. However, traditional simulations of
   stock markets on single processed computers are limited by the computing
   capability since financial researchers need larger and larger number of
   agents and more and more rounds to evolve agents' intelligence and get
   more efficient data. This paper introduces a distributed multi-agent
   simulation platform, named PSSPAM, for stock market simulation focusing
   on large scale of parallel agents, communication system and simulation
   scheduling. A logical architecture for distributed artificial stock
   market simulation is proposed, containing four loosely coupled modules:
   agent module, market module, communication system and user interface.
   With the customizable trading strategies inside, agents are deployed to
   multiple computing nodes. Agents exchange messages with each other and
   with the market based on a customizable network topology through a
   uniform communication system. With a large number of agent threads, the
   round scheduling strategy is used during the simulation, and a worker
   pool is applied in the market module. Financial researchers can design
   their own financial models and run the simulation through the user
   interface, without caring about the complexity of parallelization and
   related problems. Two groups of experiments are conducted, one with
   internal communication between agents and the other without
   communication between agents, to verify PSSPAM to be compatible with the
   data from Euronext-NYSE. And the platform shows fair scalability and
   performance under different parallelism configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Find new islands of tractability, that is classes of CSP instances for
   which polytime algorithms exist, is a fundamental task in the study of
   constraint satisfaction problems. The concept of hybrid tractable class,
   which allows to deal simultaneously with the restrictions of languages
   and, for example, the satisfaction of structural properties, is an
   approach which has already shown its interest in this domain. Here we
   study a hybrid class for non-binary CSP instances. With this aim in
   view, we consider the Broken Triangle Property (BTP) introduced in
   Cooper et al. (Artificial Intelligence, 174, 570-584 2010). While this
   tractable class has been defined for binary instances, the authors have
   suggested to extend it to instances with constraints of arbitrary
   arities, using the dual representation of such CSPs. We develop this
   idea by proposing a new definition without exploiting the dual
   representation, but using a semantic property associated to the
   compatibility relations of the constraints. This class is called DBTP
   for Dual Broken Triangle Property. We study it in depth, firstly to show
   that it is tractable. Then we compare it to some known classes. In
   particular, we prove that DBTP is incomparable with BTP and that it
   includes some well known tractable classes of CSPs such as beta-acyclic
   CSPs. Then, we compare it with the Hyper-k-Consistency, which allows us
   to also present new results for BTP. Finally, we analyse DBTP from a
   practical viewpoint, by first highlighting that some benchmarks which
   are classically used to compare the solvers are included in DBTP and
   then by explaining the efficiency of solvers of the state of the art on
   such instances thanks to their membership of the DBTP class.}},

Abstract = {{Organizations require empowered Information Systems (IS) and Knowledge
   Management Systems (KMS) to support several user's knowledge-tasks and
   decision-making responsibilities. Gradually, some KMS applications
   founded on Artificial Intelligence and semantic technology
   (ontology-based) have emerged to accomplish more suitable KMS under
   appropriate quality levels. In parallel, the previous IS/KMS success
   frameworks commonly used to evaluate the demanded quality levels are
   just based on taxonomy of quality dimensions. In this work, we have
   suggested a novel Process-based KMS Success Framework which is enhanced
   by Ontology Learning technology. Thus, this new framework is based on a
   rationale combination of some quality and user dimensions of prior KMS
   Success Frameworks that are reinforced by a systemic hierarchy of
   Knowledge processes and their cyclical behaviour. Concretely, we propose
   a new KMS success framework that makes the best of the Ontology Learning
   (OL) technology to enhance the associated knowledge-process performance
   of this kind of KMS. A knowledge engineering case study has been
   included to illustrate the systemic enhancement and the results for the
   OL application under a specific domain using this novel framework. The
   OL methodological resources (MRs) such as methods, techniques, and tools
   used to introduce changes and to reach an empowered KMS implementation
   have been completed by applying an OL methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Protein folding is a fundamental topic in molecular biology.
   Conventional experimental techniques for protein structure
   identification or protein folding recognition require strict laboratory
   requirements and heavy operating burdens, which have largely limited
   their applications. Alternatively, computer-aided techniques have been
   developed to optimize protein structures or to predict the protein
   folding process. In this paper, we utilize a 3D off-lattice model to
   describe the original protein folding scheme as a simplified
   energy-optimal numerical problem, where all types of amino acid residues
   are binarized into hydrophobic and hydrophilic ones. We apply a
   balance-evolution artificial bee colony (BE-ABC) algorithm as the
   minimization solver, which is featured by the adaptive adjustment of
   search intensity to cater for the varying needs during the entire
   optimization process. In this work, we establish a benchmark case set
   with 13 real protein sequences from the Protein Data Bank database and
   evaluate the convergence performance of BE-ABC algorithm through strict
   comparisons with several state-of-the-art ABC variants in short-term
   numerical experiments. Besides that, our obtained best-so-far protein
   structures are compared to the ones in comprehensive previous
   literature. This study also provides preliminary insights into how
   artificial intelligence techniques can be applied to reveal the dynamics
   of protein folding.}},

Abstract = {{It is very challenging to accurately detect smoke from images because of
   large variances of smoke colour, textures, shapes and occlusions. To
   improve performance, the authors combine dual threshold AdaBoost with
   staircase searching technique to propose and implement an image smoke
   detection method. First, extended Haar-like features and statistical
   features are efficiently extracted from integral images from both
   intensity and saturation components of RGB images. Then, a dual
   threshold AdaBoost algorithm with a staircase searching technique is
   proposed to classify the features of smoke for smoke detection. The
   staircase searching technique aims at keeping consistency of training
   and classifying as far as possible. Finally, dynamic analysis is
   proposed to further validate the existence of smoke. Experimental
   results demonstrate that the proposed system has a good robustness in
   terms of early smoke detection and low false alarm rate, and it can
   detect smoke from videos with size of 320 x 240 in real time.}},

   three-dimensional (3D) vision sensing is a very active orientation.
   Furthermore, weld pool description model and characteristic parameter
   model are also discussed, where intelligent algorithms were used
   generally. Besides, dynamic modeling and penetration control strategies,

   robotics, industrial manufacturing, and security. The very nature of the
   subject of image analysis determines its close relations to various
   facets of artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional approaches, which
   are based on continuous models requiring float arithmetic computations
   and rounding, ``combinatorial{''} (or ``discrete{''}) approaches are
   based on studying combinatorial properties of discrete structures. They
   provide models and algorithms, which often appear to be more efficient
   and accurate than those based on continuous models. Some recent
   combinatorial approaches aim at constructing a self-contained digital
   topology and geometry, which might be of interest and importance not
   only for image analysis, but also as independent mathematical
   disciplines.}},

Abstract = {{Enabled to provide pervasive access to distributed resources in parallel
   ways, heterogeneous scheduling is extensively applied in large-scaled
   computing system for high performance. Conventional real-time scheduling
   algorithms, however, either disregard applications' security needs and
   thus expose the applications to security threats or run applications at
   inferior security levels without optimizing security performance. In
   recognition of high reliability, a security-aware model is firstly
   presented via quantization of security overheads of heterogeneous
   systems. Secondly, inspired by multi disciplines, the meta-heuristic is
   addressed based on the supercomputer hybrid architecture. On the other
   hand, some technological breakthroughs are achieved, including boundary
   conditions for different heterogeneous computing and cloud scheduling
   and descriptions of real-time variation of scheduling indexes (stringent
   timing and security constraints). Extensive simulator and simulation
   experiments highlight higher efficacy and better scalability for the
   proposed approaches compared with the other three meta-heuristics; the
   overall improvements achieve 8 \%, 12 \% and 14 \% for high-dimension

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is applied to invert surface wave
   phase velocities. The ABC algorithm, one of swarm intelligence-based
   algorithms, is inspired from the particular intelligent foraging
   behavior of a honeybee swarm in nature. To facilitate convergence to an
   optimal solution, global exploration and local exploitation processes
   are carried out simultaneously in a robust ABC search process. Using
   synthetic and observed Rayleigh wave data, we examined the effectiveness
   and applicability of the ABC scheme in deducing an S-wave velocity
   profile for near-surface applications. Furthermore, we compared the
   performance of ABC to those of genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm
   optimization (PSO). We demonstrated that the ABC algorithm outperforms
   the standard binary-coded GA and the basic PSO, and it can be
   effectively used to interpret surface wave dispersion data with the
   great advantage of employing fewer control parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Estimates of suspended sediment concentrations and transport are an
   important part of any marine environment assessment study because these
   factors have a direct impact on the life cycle and survival of marine
   ecosystems. This paper proposes to implement a combined methodology to
   tackle these estimates. The first component of the methodology comprised
   two numerical current and wave models, while the second component was
   based on the artificial intelligence technique of neural networks (ANNs)
   used to reproduce values of sediment concentrations observed at two
   sites. The ANNs were fed with modelled currents and waves and trained to
   produce area-specific concentration estimates. The trained ANNs were
   then applied to predict sediment concentrations over an independent
   period of observations. The use of a data set that merged together
   observations from both the mentioned sites provided the best ANN testing
   results in terms of both the normalised root mean square error (0.13)
   and the mean relative error (0.02). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Immune-UUV is exploited based on IMASN by information procession and

Abstract = {{In the last few years, the video surveillance system is ubiquitous and
   can be found in many sectors (banking, transport, industry) or living
   areas (cities, office building, and store). Unfortunately, this
   technology has several drawbacks such as the violation of individual
   freedom and the inability to prevent malicious acts (stealing, crime,
   and terrorist attack... etc.). The authors' work deals on the
   development of a new video surveillance system to detect suspicious
   person based on their gestures instead of their faces, using a new
   artificial haemostasis system composed of four steps: pre-processing
   (pre-haemostasis) for digitalization of images using a novel technique
   of representation called n-gram pixel, and the weighting normalized term
   frequency; Each image vector passes through three filters: primary
   detection (primary haemostasis), secondary detection (secondary
   haemostasis) and the final detection (fibrinolysis), with an
   identification step (plasminogen activation) to evaluate the malicious
   degree of the person presents in this image; the results obtained by
   their system are promising compared to the performance of classical
   machine learning algorithms (C4.5 and KNN). The authors' system is
   composed of a visualization tool in order to see the results with more
   realism using the functionality of zooming and rotating. Their
   objectives are to help the justice in its investigations and ensure the

   The principal subject is the implementation, simulation and testing of

   driving. The design of the whole ISD system is a result of a thorough
   modelling of human psychology based on an extensive literature study.
   Concepts somehow similar to the ISD system can be found in the
   literature (Muhlestein in Cognit Comput 5(1):99-105, 2012; Wiggins in
   Cognit Comput 4(3):306-319, 2012), but there are no reports of a system

Abstract = {{Rising complexity within multi-tier computing architectures remains an
   open problem. As complexity increases, so do the costs associated with
   operating and maintaining systems within these environments. One
   approach for addressing these problems is to build self-healing systems
   (i.e. frameworks) that can autonomously detect and recover from faulty
   states. Self-healing systems often combine machine learning techniques
   with closed control loops to reduce the number of situations requiring
   human intervention. This is particularly useful in situations where
   human involvement is both costly to develop, and a source of potential
   faults. Therefore, a survey of self-healing frameworks and methodologies
   in multi-tier architectures is provided to the reader. Uniquely, this
   study combines an overview of the state of the art with a comparative
   analysis of the computing environment, degree of behavioural autonomy,
   and organisational requirements of these approaches. Highlighting these
   aspects provides for an understanding of the different situational
   benefits of these self-healing systems. We conclude with a discussion of
   potential and current research directions within this field. Copyright

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm represents one of the most-studied
   swarm intelligence algorithms. Since the original ABC has been found to
   be very effective, today there are a lot of improved variants of ABC
   algorithm used to solve a wide range of hard optimization problems. This
   paper describes a novel artificial bee colony algorithm for constrained
   optimization problems. In the proposed algorithm, five modifications are
   introduced. Firstly, to improve the exploitation abilities of ABC, two
   different modified ABC search operators are used in employed and
   onlooker phases, and crossover operator is used in scout phase instead
   of random search. Secondly, modifications related to dynamic tolerance
   for handling equality constraints and improved boundary
   constraint-handling method are employed. The experimental results,
   obtained by testing on a set of 24 well-known benchmark functions and
   four widely used engineering design problems, show that the proposed
   approach can outperform ABC-based approaches for constrained
   optimization problems in terms of the quality of the results, robustness
   and convergence speed. Additionally, it provides better results in most
   cases compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, meta-heuristic intelligent approaches are developed for
   handling nonlinear oscillatory problems with stiff and non-stiff
   conditions. The mathematical modeling of these oscillators is
   accomplished using feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the
   form of an unsupervised manner. The accuracy as well as efficiency of
   the model is subject to the tuning of adaptive parameters for ANNs that
   are highly stochastic in nature. These optimal weights are carried out
   with swarm intelligence and pattern search methods hybridized with an
   efficient local search technique based on constraints minimization known
   as active set algorithm. The proposed schemes are validated on various
   stiff and non-stiff variants of the oscillator. The significance,
   applicability and reliability of the proposed scheme are well
   established based on comparison made with the results of standard
   numerical solver.}},

Title = {{Application of acoustic directional data for audio event recognition via
   HMM/CRF in perimeter surveillance systems}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{15-28}},

Abstract = {{Audio event detection (AED) and recognition is a signal processing and
   analysis domain used in a wide range of applications including
   surveillance, home automation and behavioral assessment. The field
   presents numerous challenges to the current state-of-the-art due to its
   highly nonlinear nature. High false alarm rates (FARs) in such
   applications particularly limit the capabilities of vision-based
   perimeter monitoring systems by inducing high operator dependence. On
   the other hand, conventional fence-based vibration detectors and
   pressure-driven ``taut wires{''} offer high sensitivity at the cost of a
   high FAR due to debris, animals and weather.
   This work reports an audio event identification methodology implemented
   as a test-bed system for a surveillance application to reduce FAR,
   maximize blind-spot coverage and improve audio event classification
   accuracy. The first phase utilizes a nonlinear autoregressive classifier
   to locate and classify discrete audio events via an exogenous sound
   direction variable to improve classifier confidence. The second phase
   implements a time-series-based system to recognize various audio
   activity groups from nominal everyday sound events such as traffic and
   muffled speech. The discretely labeled data is thus trained with HMM and
   Conditional Random Field classifiers and reports a substantial
   improvement in classification accuracies of indoor human activities. (C)

Abstract = {{Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is one of the swarm intelligence
   algorithms; it has been introduced by Karaboga in 2005. It is a
   meta-heuristic optimization search algorithm inspired from the
   intelligent foraging behavior of the honey bees in nature. Its unique
   search process made it as one of the most competitive algorithm with
   some other search algorithms in the area of optimization, such as
   Genetic algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). However,
   the ABC performance of the local search process and the bee movement or
   the solution improvement equation still has some weaknesses. The ABC is
   good in avoiding trapping at the local optimum but it spends its time
   searching around unpromising random selected solutions. Inspired by the
   PSO, we propose a Hybrid Particle-movement ABC algorithm called HPABC,
   which adapts the particle movement process to improve the exploration of
   the original ABC algorithm. Numerical benchmark functions were used in
   order to experimentally test the HPABC algorithm. The results illustrate
   that the HPABC algorithm can outperform the ABC algorithm in most of the
   experiments (75\% better in accuracy and over 3 times faster).}},

Abstract = {{Given the recent developments in alternative authentication interfaces
   for smartphones, tablets and touchscreen laptops, one of the mostly
   selected method is the pattern passwords. Basically, the users that
   prefer this method, draw a pattern between the nodes to open the lock in
   lieu of entering an alphanumeric password. Although drawing a pattern
   seems easier than typing a password, it has a major security drawback
   since it can be very easy to be stolen. Therefore, this paper proposes
   some novel theoretical ideas with artificial intelligence methods, to
   improve security of pattern password authentication, using touching
   durations as biometric traits. What we put forward is the utilization of
   three different neural network based algorithms to verify logins with
   one novel histogram-based technique in a hidden interface for
   enrollment, training and verification.
   Inspired by the keystroke recognition models, the touch time and
   durations are extracted to create a ghost password. Moreover, the nodes
   are colored depending on the touch duration in the hidden interface and
   subsequently the colored images are exported. As a result of training
   session, the system discriminates real attempts from frauds using
   artificial neural networks (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems
   (ANFIS) and Red-Green-Blue (RGB) Histogram methods in verification
   phase. The results are greatly encouraging that we reached 0\% of false
   accept rate (FAR) for 80 fraud attacks with 16.5\% false reject rate
   (FRR) of unsuccessful authentication for the 80 real attempts when
   started with interval checking algorithm. Moreover, to reduce this FRR,
   we utilized neural network based systems and consequently with ANN, we
   achieved 8.75\% equal error rate (EER), with ANFIS, 2.5\% EER for 85\%
   proximity and finally with RGB Histogram method, we attained 7.5\% EER.

Abstract = {{Grid computing is considered a promising trend, which enables the
   sharing of a wide variety of computational and storage resources
   geographically distributed. Despite the advantages of such paradigm,
   several problems have emerged during the last decade; most of them
   caused by an inefficient utilization of grid resources. The present
   contribution proposes an approach to improve the grid resources
   selection process. An optimization model for choosing grid resources in
   an intelligent way has been designed. A mathematical formulation to
   monitor the resources efficiency has also been established. Furthermore,
   the model provides a self-adaptive capability to grid applications,
   enhancing them for dealing with the changing environmental conditions.
   The model applies an artificial intelligence algorithm for ensuring an
   efficient selection. In particular, three different versions have been
   implemented. Each of them uses a different algorithm. Finally, during
   the evaluation phase of the model, the experimental tests were performed
   in a real grid infrastructure. The results show that the model improves
   the infrastructure throughput, by increasing the finished tasks rate and
   by reducing the applications execution time. Copyright (C) 2014 John

Abstract = {{Microbioreactors with immobilized cells or enzymes are normally packed
   uniformly. However, uniform packing is good only when the flow is
   uniform throughout the microtube. In real situations this is not true.
   For such cases it was shown recently that, although radial variations
   may be ignored, a topologically optimized longitudinal distribution of
   immobilized pellets generated higher outputs of glucoamylase by a
   recombinant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, topology
   optimization (or any equation-based method) requires a good (and
   preferably simple) mathematical model. Such models are difficult to
   formulate for real nonideal conditions. Hence, a recent article by this
   author employed an expert system that selected between two artificial
   intelligence (AI) methods to determine the better method over successive
   intervals of time. However, such a switching strategy is complex and
   practically difficult. The present work, therefore, investigates a
   corresponding set of single (standalone) AI methods, each incorporating
   more biological information than earlier methods. For the same S.
   cerevisiae strain, it was seen that expressing the two input
   variables-feed concentration of glucose and the lengthwise distribution
   of immobilized cells-by genetic algorithms allowed greater flexibility
   and resulted in higher production rates of recombinant glucoamylase than
   all the methods used previously. This method is also easier to implement
   than topology optimization and the variable AI method.}},

Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{The quantised kernel least mean square (QKLMS) is a simple yet efficient
   online learning algorithm, which reduces the computational cost
   significantly by quantising the input space to constrain the growth of
   network size. The QKLMS considers only the input space compression and
   assumes that the desired outputs of the quantised data are equal to
   those of the closest centres. In many cases, however, the outputs in a
   neighbourhood may have big differences, especially when the underlying
   system is disturbed by impulsive noises. Such fluctuation in desired
   outputs may seriously deteriorate the learning performance. To address
   this issue, a simple online method is proposed to smooth the desired
   signal within a neighbourhood corresponding to a quantisation region.
   The resulting algorithm is referred to as the QKLMS with desired signal
   smoothing. The desirable performance of the new algorithm is confirmed
   by Monte Carlo simulations.}},

   Purcell factor are first identified and considered as the main
   objectives when designing such LEDs. These two objectives are then
   optimised simultaneously even though both are in conflict. The proposed
   method is developed within a framework and applied to a case study. A
   comparative study shows that the optimised PhC LEDs completely
   outperform current works in the literature. These results are obtained
   by just tuning the PhC structural parameters, which can be considered as
   a substantial achievement in this field.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on direction finding of a signal source using
   time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements at a 3-D acoustic sensor
   array. Two evolutionary computation methods are proposed to solve the
   direction finding problem, which are the genetic algorithm and the
   particle swarm optimization algorithm. Sound speed is used in the
   development of the algorithms, which is estimated based on observed
   weather parameters and initial direction estimation results from the
   least square (LS) estimator which is presently the key method in
   TDOA-based direction finding. All reference-free TDOA measurements are
   adopted in defining cost function to improve performance. To guarantee
   fast convergence, an LS estimator is also utilized to provide initial
   direction estimates for the two swarm intelligent algorithms. Simulation
   results demonstrate that the proposed methods with a full TDOA set are
   superior to the Cramer Rao lower bound with a limited set of
   referencebased TDOA measurement, significantly outperforming the LS
   estimator. Extensive field experiments were conducted and there is good
   agreement between the experimental results and simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{The smart electricity grid enables a two-way flow of power and data
   between suppliers and consumers in order to facilitate the power flow
   optimization in terms of economic efficiency, reliability and
   sustainability. This infrastructure permits the consumers and the
   micro-energy producers to take a more active role in the electricity
   market and the dynamic energy management (DEM). The most important
   challenge in a smart grid (SG) is how to take advantage of the users'
   participation in order to reduce the cost of power. However, effective
   DEM depends critically on load and renewable production forecasting.
   This calls for intelligent methods and solutions for the real-time
   exploitation of large volumes of data generated by the vast amount of
   smart meters. Hence, robust data analytics, high performance computing,
   efficient data network management, and cloud computing techniques are
   critical towards the optimized operation of SGs. This research aims to
   highlight the big data issues and challenges faced by the DEM employed
   in SG networks. It also provides a brief description of the most
   commonly used data processing methods in the literature, and proposes a
   promising direction for future research in the field. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The volume of information used in the Emergency Coordination Center
   (1-1-2 CECOES), which depends on the Canary Government, during and after
   any adverse weather phenomenon (FMA in Spanish) is now significantly
   greater than before, The amount of bulletins warnings and forecasts
   about FMA sent by the Meteorological Agency (AEMET), and received at the
   1-1-2 CECOES, is really considerable. The information should be treated
   as soon as possible in order to generate the corresponding pre-alerts
   and notifications, as well as public notices to the citizens.
   The rule-based expert systems can overcome the human capacity, for
   example, when required to analyze a large volume of data in a limited
   period of time, as in the emergency services. Moreover, Fuzzy Logic is
   an artificial intelligence methodology that is effective when dealing
   with vagueness or ambiguity, erroneous or absence of information,
   something that the emergency services are used to: for example, ``It
   rains a lot{''}, ``the storm is far away{''}, ``it is windy{''} and ``we
   have low temperatures{''}, are typical responses given by some callers
   when they alert 1-1-2. Finally, Weather Forecasts usually work with
   imprecise concepts such as: possibility, (when the probability that a
   weather phenomenon occurs is between 10 and 40\%) and probability, (when
   between 40 and 70\%).
   We have primarily developed an expert helping-system for decision-making
   based on an inference engine implemented with Fuzzy Logic in CECOES
   1-1-2. This system is able to provide clear answers at the inaccuracy or
   lack of information, and if trained with real cases, it can improve
   human behavior giving a quick and effective response.}},

Abstract = {{A behavioral paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) systems is

   outline of the state of art in the field of behavioral models of

   semantically interpreted behavioral metamodel in the form of a
   domain-independent reference ontology and its extensions for two
   particular practically important classes of applications are proposed.
   The first class of applications deals with the team work of underwater
   robots autonomously inspecting underwater space in order to ensure its
   security. The second one corresponds to self-organizing systems composed
   of a large number of small satellites that autonomously communicate,

   the main AI and NL components, which were developed over multiple
   phases. The first phase focuses on enabling core functionality such as
   effectively finding programs matching the user's intent. The second
   phase focuses on enabling dialogue with the user. Finally, we present

   accumulated customer reviews are available. These are for example
   yelp.com, tripadviser.com and tophotels.ru, etc. To see and show the
   efficacy of the proposed approach, we have carried out experiments on
   hotel client satisfaction. The results have proven the effectiveness of
   the proposed approach to decision support in product quality management

Abstract = {{Most image compression algorithms suffer from several drawbacks:
   high-computational complexity, moderate reconstructed picture qualities,
   and a variable bit rate. In this paper, an efficient color image
   quantization technique that depends on an optimized Fuzzy C-means (OFCM)
   algorithm is proposed. It exploits the optimization capability of the
   improved artificial fish swarm algorithm to overcome the shortage of
   Fuzzy C-means algorithm. It uses error diffusion algorithms to obtain
   perceptually better images after quantization. Experiments are carried
   out to estimate the performance of the proposed OFCM algorithm in image
   compression using standard image set. The results indicate that the
   algorithm can decrease effectively the mean square deviation of color
   quantization, keep overall arrangement of ideas and part characteristic
   detail in image reconstruction. The performance efficiency of the
   proposed technique is compared with those of three other quantization
   algorithms. The Comparative results confirmed that the OFCM has
   potential in terms of both accuracy and perceptual quality as compared
   to recent methods of the literature.}},

Title = {{A wrapper-based approach for feature selection and classification of
   major depressive disorder-bipolar disorders}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{127-137}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Feature selection (FS) and classification are consecutive artificial
   intelligence (Al) methods used in data analysis, pattern classification,
   data mining and medical informatics. Beside promising studies in the
   application of Al methods to health informatics, working with more
   informative features is crucial in order to contribute to early
   diagnosis. Being one of the prevalent psychiatric disorders, depressive
   episodes of bipolar disorder (BD) is often misdiagnosed as major
   depressive disorder (MDD), leading to suboptimal therapy and poor
   outcomes. Therefore discriminating MDD and BD at earlier stages of
   illness could help to facilitate efficient and specific treatment. In
   this study, a nature inspired and novel FS algorithm based on standard
   Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), called improved ACO (IACO), was used to
   reduce the number of features by removing irrelevant and redundant data.
   The selected features were then fed into support vector machine (SVM), a
   powerful mathematical tool for data classification, regression, function
   estimation and modeling processes, in order to classify MDD and BD
   subjects. Proposed method used coherence, a promising quantitative
   electroencephalography (EEG) biomarker, values calculated from alpha,
   theta and delta frequency bands. The noteworthy performance of novel
   IACO-SVM approach stated that it is possible to discriminate 46 BD and
   55 MDD subjects using 22 of 48 features with 80.19\% overall
   classification accuracy. The performance of IACO algorithm was also
   compared to the performance of standard ACO, genetic algorithm (GA) and
   particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms in terms of their
   classification accuracy and number of selected features. In order to
   provide an almost unbiased estimate of classification error, the
   validation process was performed using nested cross-validation (CV)
   procedure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tuning game difficulty prior to release requires careful consideration.
   Players can quickly lose interest in a game if it is too hard or too
   easy. Assessing how players will cope prior to release is often
   inaccurate. However, modern games can now collect sufficient data to
   perform large scale analysis postdeployment and update the product based
   on these insights. AI Factory Spades is currently the top rated Spades
   game in the Google Play store. In collaboration with the developers, we
   have collected gameplay data from 27 592 games and statistics regarding
   wins/losses for 99 866 games using Google Analytics. Using the data
   collected, this study analyses the difficulty and behavior of an
   Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search player we developed and deployed
   in the game previously. The methods of data collection and analysis
   presented in this study are generally applicable. The same work-flow
   could be used to analyze the difficulty and typical player or opponent
   behavior in any game. Furthermore, addressing issues of difficulty or
   nonhuman-like opponents postdeployment can positively affect player
   retention.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed information infrastructures are increasingly used in the
   geospatial domain. In the infrastructures, data are being collected by
   distributed sensor services, served by distributed geospatial data
   services, transformed by processing services and workflows, and consumed
   by smart clients. Consequently, Geographical Information Systems (GISs)
   are moving from GISystems to GIServices. Intelligent GIServices are
   enriched with new capabilities including knowledge representation,
   semantic reasoning, automatic workflow composition, and quality and
   traceability. Such Intelligent GIServices facilitate information
   discovery and integration over the network and automate the assembly of
   GIServices to provide value-added products. This paper provides an
   overview of intelligent GIServices. The concept of intelligent
   GIServices is described, followed by a review of the state-of-the-art
   technologies and methodologies relevant to intelligent GIServices.
   Visions on how GIServices can perceive, reason, learn, and act
   intelligently are highlighted. The results can provide better services
   for big data processing, semantic interoperability, knowledge discovery,
   and cross-discipline collaboration in Earth science applications.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Textual Case-Based Reasoning (TCBR) is an artificial intelligence
   approach to problem solving and learning in which textual expertise is
   collected in a library of past cases. One of the critical application
   domains is the Islamic Fatawa (religious verdict) domain, which refers
   to seeking a legal ruling for religious issues that Muslims all over the
   globe pose on a daily basis. Official religious organizations like
   Egypt's Dar al-Ifta(1) is responsible for receiving and answering
   people's religious inquiries daily. Due to the enormous number of
   inquiries Dar al-Ifta receives every day, it cannot he handled at the
   same time. This task actually requires a certain smart system that can
   help in fulfilling people's needs for answers. However, applying TCBR in
   the domain of issuing Fatawa faces several challenges related to the
   language syntax and semantics. The contribution of this paper is to
   propose an intelligent fatwa Questions Answering (QA) system that can
   overcome the challenges and respond to a user's inquiry through
   providing semantically closest inquiries that previously answered.
   Moreover, the paper shows how the proposed system can learn when a new
   inquiry arrives. Finally, results will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Automation of engineering procedures for the development of new
   manufacturing processes is of great importance in modern competitive
   conditions. For example, metalworking companies would greatly benefit
   from the development of methods for automatic generation, testing and
   optimization of part programs for machining operations. Indeed, the
   generation of part programs-even by using CAM software-does still
   require strong human intervention and it is basically a best guess
   approach with minimum optimization. Moreover, further refinement and
   correction of the part program on the machine tool is often necessary.
   Machining operations are generally based on a large number of parameters
   and therefore optimization strategies should be able to deal with
   high-dimensional spaces and disjoint domains. In this paper, two swarm
   intelligence optimization algorithms-particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   and artificial bee colony (ABC)-have been applied for optimizating the
   part program of a complex turning part. The optimizers were implemented
   in a framework for automatic part program generation, realistic
   simulation, and feasibility analysis. The results evidenced that both
   approaches were capable of optimizing efficiently the part program, and
   that the optimization time of the PSO approach on modern computers may
   be suitable for application in production.}},

   Radial Basis Function Neural Network}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Scouring of bridge piers is a major cause of bridge failure worldwide.
   Thus, designing safe depths for new bridge foundations and
   assessing/monitoring the safety of existing bridge foundations are
   critical to reducing the risk of bridge collapse and the subsequent
   potential losses in terms of life and property. This paper develops and
   tests the evolutionary radial basis function neural network (ERBFNN) as
   a model to forecast scour depth at bridge piers. The ERBFNN is an
   artificial intelligence (AI) inference model that integrates the radial
   basis function neural network (RBFNN) and the artificial bee colony
   (ABC). In the ERBFNN, the RBFNN handles the learning and fitting curves
   and ABC uses optimization to search for the optimal hidden neuron number
   N-n and width sigma of the Gaussian function. The performance of the
   ERBFNN is compared with four other AI techniques, including the
   back-propagation neural network (BPNN), genetic programming (GP), M5
   regression tree (M5), and support vector machine (SVM). Further, the
   prediction accuracy of the ERBFNN is bench-marked against four prevalent
   mathematical methods, including the HEC-18 method, Mississippi's method,
   Laursen and Toch's method, and Froehlich's method. Results of these
   comparisons demonstrate that the ERBFNN predicts scour depth at bridge
   piers with a degree of accuracy that is significantly better than
   current, widely used methods. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm has been emerged as one of the
   latest Swarm Intelligence based algorithm. Though, ABC is a competitive
   algorithm as compared to many other optimization techniques, the
   drawbacks like preference on exploration at the cost of exploitation and
   skipping the true solution due to large step sizes, are also associated
   with it. In this paper, two modifications are proposed in the basic
   version of ABC to deal with these drawbacks: solution update strategy is
   modified by incorporating the role of fitness of the solutions and a
   local search based on greedy logarithmic decreasing step size is
   applied. The modified ABC is named as accelerating ABC with an adaptive
   local search (AABCLS). The former change is incorporated to guide to not
   so good solutions about the directions for position update, while the
   latter modification concentrates only on exploitation of the available
   information of the search space. To validate the performance of the
   proposed algorithm AABCLS, benchmark optimization problems of different
   complexities are considered and results comparison section shows the
   clear superiority of the proposed modification over the Basic ABC and
   the other recent variants namely, Best-So-Far ABC (BSFABC), Gbest guided
   ABC (GABC), Opposition based levy flight ABC (OBLFABC) and Modified ABC

Abstract = {{Direct matrix converter (DMC) is an AC-AC converter which supplies power
   flow between AC power supply and the load for changing voltage and

   control structures provide considerable advantages to itself with
   respect to the classical AC-AC converter topologies. In this article,
   the new control method based on swarm optimization is suggested and
   analyzed comparatively for 3-phase DMC to improve the robustness of DMC
   control system. The switching generator designed with this control
   method generates optimal switching states using swarm intelligence-based
   optimization algorithm and also applies them to the DMC. To compare the
   control performance of the method for this type of operating conditions,
   chaotic-based particle swarm optimization and artificial bee colony
   algorithms are used since their relatively short program codes and
   superior optimization performances. The results of this study show that
   the proposed control method can be applied to the DMC control system
   successfully as a new control technique.}},

Abstract = {{Many real-world problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) as well as in
   other areas of computer science and engineering can be efficiently
   modeled and solved using constraint programming techniques. In many
   real-world scenarios the problem is partially known, imprecise and
   dynamic such that some effects of actions are undesired and/or several
   unforeseen incidences or changes can occur. Whereas expressivity,
   efficiency, and optimality have been the typical goals in the area,
   there are several issues regarding robustness that have a clear
   relevance in dynamic Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). However,
   there is still no clear and common definition of robustness-related
   concepts in CSPs. In this paper, we propose two clearly differentiated
   definitions for robustness and stability in CSP solutions. We also
   introduce the concepts of recoverability and reliability, which arise in
   temporal CSPs. All these definitions are based on related well-known
   concepts, which are addressed in engineering and other related areas.}},

Abstract = {{The present research is focused on the object tracking domain based upon
   a new probabilistic estimation approach. This is realized through a
   generalization of the particle filter framework (PFF), in association
   with a neural network, namely an intelligence-based PFF (IPFF). In this
   idea, a number of appropriate features of mobile objects should first be
   considered for use in the process of IPFF realization to make the
   estimation and better performance. The applicability of the proposed
   approach has been considered though three separated scenarios, including
   non-stationary, stationary/non-stationary and finally stationary
   objects, as long as the standard mean shift object tracking approach is
   realized as a benchmark approach. The experimental results verify the
   approach performance improvement.}},

Abstract = {{In typhoon-prone areas, in order to announce catastrophe warnings in
   advance accurate storm-intensity prediction is essential. In this study,
   forecasting typhoon intensity with their characteristics has been
   supported by two different artificial intelligence methods, a simple
   artificial neural network (ANN) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
   system (ANFIS) based on genetic algorithm (GA). The data used throughout
   this paper are from the reanalysis data set of the National Centers for
   Environmental Prediction and the best track database of the National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The typhoons selected for this
   study happened during 1985-2008 over the South China Sea. By comparing
   the results from these two methods, their advantages and dis-advantages
   were investigated. The results of the study confirm the superiority of
   the ANFIS-GA method, because its root mean square error was 3.78, which
   is significantly lower than the value of 6.11 for the ANN method in the
   best experiments. Considering the literature in typhoon intensity
   prediction by ANN and ANFIS models, the contribution of this paper is to
   investigate whether or not these methods are able to forecast typhoon
   intensity. The study represents that the ANFIS model can produce more
   applicable predictions for typhoon intensity than the ANN model.}},

Abstract = {{Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a popular population based approach
   used to solve nonlinear and complex optimization problems. It is simple
   to implement and swarm based probabilistic algorithm but, it also has
   drawbacks like it easily falls into local optima and suffers from slow
   convergence in the later stages. In order to reduce the chance of
   stagnation, while improving the convergence speed, a new position
   updating phase is incorporated with PSO, namely fitness based position
   updating in PSO. The proposed phase is inspired from the onlooker bee
   phase of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. In the proposed position
   updating phase, solutions update their positions based on probability
   which is a function of fitness. This strategy provides more position
   updating chances to the better solutions in the solution search process.
   The proposed algorithm is named as fitness based particle swarm
   optimization (FPSO). To show the efficiency of FPSO, it is compared with
   standard PSO 2011 and ABC algorithm over 15 well known benchmark
   problems and three real world engineering optimization problems.}},

Abstract = {{An important consideration during product development is the
   sustainability level of a product. Thus, several tools and methods have
   been developed to assess product sustainability. However, most of
   current tools focus only on the environmental element without
   considering two important sustainability elements such economic and
   social elements. Other tools are limited to the cradle-to-gate system
   boundary, which covers two phases of the product life cycle from raw
   material extraction to the end of the manufacturing stage. Users need to
   understand the mathematical calculations and tools needed to achieve
   this purpose. Hence, this paper developed a comprehensive method for
   assessing the sustainability of product development considering all
   sustainability elements from cradle-to-grave. A graphical user interface
   (GUI) was developed for ease of use from the structured methodology. The
   developed GUI was embedded with the fuzzy logic calculation under the
   Matlab GUI platform with codes and callback functions by using fuzzy
   linguistics. The GUI presented is a user friendly assessment since users
   no need to understand the mathematical equation embedded. A product was
   selected as a case study to demonstrate the use of the GUI. The

Abstract = {{With the advancement in the field of Artificial Intelligence, there have
   been considerable efforts to develop technologies for pattern
   recognition related to medical diagnosis. Artificial Neural Networks
   (ANNs), a significant piece of Artificial Intelligence forms the base
   for most of the marvels in the former field. However, ANNs face the
   problem of premature convergence at a local minimum and inability to set
   hyper-parameters (like the number of neurons, learning rate, etc.) while
   using Back Propagation Algorithm (BPA). In this paper, we have used the
   Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the evolution of the ANN, which overcomes the
   limitations of the BPA. Since GA alone cannot fit for a
   high-dimensional, complex and multi-modal optimization landscape of the
   ANN, BPA is used as a local search algorithm to aid the evolution. The
   contributions of GA and BPA in the resultant approach are adjudged to
   determine the magnitude of local search necessary for optimization,
   striking a clear balance between exploration and exploitation in the
   evolution. The algorithm was applied to deal with the problem of Breast
   Cancer diagnosis. Results showed that under optimal settings, hybrid
   algorithm performs better than BPA or GA alone.}},

Abstract = {{Sentiment analysis mainly focuses on the study of one's opinions that
   express positive or negative sentiments. With the explosive growth of
   web documents, sentiment analysis is becoming a hot topic in both
   academic research and system design. Fine-grained sentiment analysis is
   traditionally solved as a 2-step strategy, which results in cascade
   errors. Although joint models, such as joint sentiment/topic and maximum
   entropy (MaxEnt)/latent Dirichlet allocation, are proposed to tackle
   this problem of sentiment analysis, they focus on the joint learning of
   both aspects and sentiments. Thus, they are not appropriate to solve the
   cascade errors for sentiment analysis at the sentence or subsentence
   level. In this article, we present a novel jointly fine-grained
   sentiment analysis framework at the subsentence level with Markov logic.
   First, we divide the task into 2 separate stages (subjectivity
   classification and polarity classification). Then, the 2 separate stages
   are processed, respectively, with different feature sets, which are
   implemented by local formulas in Markov logic. Finally, global formulas
   in Markov logic are adopted to realize the interactions of the 2
   separate stages. The joint inference of subjectivity and polarity helps
   prevent cascade errors. Experiments on a Chinese sentiment data set
   manifest that our joint model brings significant improvements.}},

Abstract = {{A physical habitat simulation is a useful tool for assessing the impact
   of river development or restoration on river ecosystem. Conventional
   methods of physical habitat simulation use the habitat suitability index
   models and their success depends largely on how well the model reflects
   monitoring data. One of preferred habitat suitability index models is
   habitat suitability curves, which are normally constructed based on
   monitoring data. However, these curves can easily be affected by the
   subjective opinion of the expert. This study introduces the ANFIS method
   for predicting the composite suitability index for use in physical
   habitat simulations. The ANFIS method is a hybrid type of artificial
   intelligence technique that combines the artificial neural network and
   fuzzy logic. The method is known to be a powerful approach especially
   for developing nonlinear relationships between input and output
   datasets.
   In this study, the ANFIS method was used to predict the composite
   suitability index for the physical habitat simulation of a 2.5 km long
   reach of the Dal River in Korea. Zacco platypus was chosen as the target
   fish of the study area. A 2D hydraulic simulation was performed, and the
   hydraulic model was validated by comparing the measured and predicted
   water surface elevations. The distribution of the composite suitability
   index predicted by the ANFIS model was compared with that using the
   habitat suitability curves. The comparisons reveal that the two
   distributions are similar for various flows. In addition, the
   distribution of the composite suitability index of the Dal River is
   computed by the ANFIS method using monitoring data for the other
   watersheds, namely the Hongcheon River, the Geum River, and the Chogang
   Stream. The monitoring data for the Chogang Stream, correlation pattern
   of which was the most similar to that of the Dal River, yielded the
   distribution of the composite suitability index, which was very close to
   that obtained using data for the Dal River. This is also supported by
   the mean absolute percentage error for the difference in the weighted
   usable areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The facts show that multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning plays a
   pivotal role in Artificial Intelligence studies. Evidently, the MIML
   learning introduces a framework in which data is described by a bag of
   instances associated with a set of labels. In this framework, the
   modeling of the connection is the challenging problem for MIML. The RBF
   neural network can explain the complex relations between the instances
   and labels in the MIMLRBF. The parameters estimation of the RBF network
   is a difficult task. In this paper, the computational convergence and
   the modeling accuracy of the RBF network has been improved. The present
   study aimed to investigate the impact of a novel hybrid algorithm
   consisting of Gases Brownian Motion optimization (GBMO) algorithm and
   the gradient based fast converging parameter estimation method on
   multi-instance multi-label learning. In the current study, a hybrid
   algorithm was developed to estimate the RBF neural network parameters
   (the weights, widths and centers of the hidden units) simultaneously.
   The algorithm uses the robustness of the GBMO to search the parameter
   space and the efficiency of the gradient. For this purpose, two
   real-world MIML tasks and a Corel dataset were utilized within a
   two-step experimental design. In the first step, the GBMO algorithm was
   used to determine the widths and centers of the network nodes. In the
   second step, for each molecule with fixed inputs and number of hidden
   nodes, the parameters were optimized by a structured nonlinear parameter
   optimization method (SNPOM). The findings demonstrated the superior
   performance of the hybrid algorithmic method. Additionally, the results
   for training and testing the dataset revealed that the hybrid method
   enhances RBF network learning more efficiently in comparison with other
   conventional RBF approaches. The results obtain better modeling accuracy
   than some other algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In last decades, lots of nature-inspired optimization algorithms are
   developed and presented to the literature for solving optimization
   problems. Generally, these optimization algorithms can be grouped into
   two categories: evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence methods.
   Evolutionary methods try to improve the candidate solutions
   (chromosomes) using evolutionary operators such as crossover, mutation.
   The methods in swarm intelligence category use differential position
   update rules for obtaining new candidate solutions. The popularity of
   the swarm intelligence methods has grown since 1990s due to their
   simplicity, easy adaptation to the problem and effectiveness in solving
   the nonlinear optimization problems. One of the popular members of swarm
   intelligence algorithms is artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm which
   simulates the intelligent behaviors of real honey bees and uses
   differential position update rule. When food sources which present
   possible solutions for the optimization problems gather on the similar
   points within the search space, differential position update rule can
   cause a stagnation behavior in the algorithm during the search process.
   In this paper, a distribution-based solution update rule is proposed for
   the basic ABC algorithm instead of differential update rule to overcome
   stagnation behavior of the algorithm. Distribution-based update rule
   uses the mean and standard deviation of the selected two food sources to
   obtain a new candidate solution without using any differential-based
   processes. This approach is therefore prevents the stagnation in the
   population. The proposed approach is tested on 18 benchmark functions
   with different characteristics and compared with the basic variants of
   ABC algorithm and some nature-inspired methods. The experimental results
   show that the proposed approach produces acceptable and comparable
   solutions for the numeric problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel heuristic based adaptive control technique
   (ACT) for improved compensation capability of the unified power quality
   conditioner (UPQC). The compensation capability of UPQC is enhanced by
   the optimal regulation of DC link voltage. Among all power quality (PQ)
   distortions, voltage sag is the severe PQ problem that significantly
   deteriorates the regulation of DC link voltage. The conventional
   approaches utilize a fixed gain PI controller that increases the error
   between the reference and actual DC link voltage under sag condition.
   This ultimately results in poor compensation of PQ distortions at the
   point of common coupling. To enhance compensation capability, the
   performance of ACT is examined with analytical and artificial
   intelligence techniques. The model reference adaptive system (MRAS) is
   used in the analytical method for online self tuning PI controller. For
   artificial intelligence technique, the off-line trained ANFIS is
   processed in the simulation studies. The performance of ACT based UPQC
   is validated in Matlab/Simulink and the obtained results are compared
   with conventional scheme. To substantiate theoretical results of the
   proposed approach, the algorithm is tested in real time Xilinx system

Abstract = {{The process of high speed milling is regarded as one of the most
   sophisticated and complicated manufacturing operations. In the past four
   decades, many investigations have been conducted on this process, aiming
   to better understand its nature and improve the surface quality of the
   products as well as extending tool life. To achieve these goals, it is
   necessary to form a general descriptive reference model of the milling
   process using experimental data, thermomechanical analysis, statistical
   or artificial intelligence (AI) models. Moreover, increasing demands for
   more efficient milling processes, qualified surface finishing, and
   modeling techniques have propelled the development of more effective
   modeling methods and approaches. In this paper, an extensive literature
   survey of the state-of-the-art modeling techniques of milling processes
   will be carried out, more specifically of recent advances and
   applications of AI-based modeling techniques. The comparative study of
   the available methods as well as the suitability of each method for
   corresponding types of experiments will be presented. In addition, the
   weaknesses of each method as well as open research challenges will be
   presented. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of recent developments

Abstract = {{Robotic intelligence has recently received significant attention in the
   research community. Application of such artificial intelligence can be
   used to perform automatic document retrieval and interpretation by a
   robot through query. So, it is necessary to extract the key information
   from the document based on the query to produce the desired feedback.
   For this purpose, in this paper we propose a system for automatic date
   field extraction from multi-lingual (English, Devnagari and Bangla
   scripts) handwritten documents. The date is a key piece of information,
   which can be used in various robotic applications such as date-wise
   document indexing/retrieval. In order to design the system, first the
   script of the document is identified, and based on the identified
   script, word components of each text line are classified into month and
   non-month classes using word-level feature extraction and
   classification. Next, non-month words are segmented into individual
   components and labelled into one of text, digit, punctuation or
   contraction categories. Subsequently, the date patterns are searched
   using the labelled components. Both numeric and semi-numeric regular
   expressions have been used for date part extraction. Dynamic Time
   Warping (DTW) and profile feature-based approaches are used for
   classification of month/non-month words. Other date components such as
   numerals and punctuation marks are recognised using a gradient-based
   feature and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The experiments are
   performed on English, Devnagari and Bangla document datasets and the
   encouraging results obtained from the system indicate the effectiveness
   of the proposed system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Global warming is one of the most serious issues faced by today's world.
   The increase in world population and adoption of modern lifestyle have
   dramatically increased the demand for energy. Over the last decade
   Higher Educational Institution (HEI) buildings have seen massive
   increase in energy consumption due to increased use of IT equipments,
   longer occupancy and increased use of Heating Ventilation and Air
   Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Current Building Management Systems (BMS)
   fail to optimize energy consumption of HVAC systems in commercial and
   educational buildings. In this paper we present an intelligent agent
   based system to optimize energy consumption of HVAC system in HEI
   buildings. The system employs artificial intelligence techniques to
   predict the demand of the system and optimize energy consumption of the
   HVAC system. The experimental results have shown that the deployment of
   the system has resulted in 3\% reduction in energy consumption of HVAC.

Abstract = {{Assembly lines are usually constructed as the last stage of the entire

   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first formal presentation of

   solve the problem with a GA-based approach in the literature. The
   proposed approach is illustrated with an example to explain the
   procedures of the algorithm. Test problems are solved and promising
   results are obtained. Statistical tests are designed to analyse the
   advantage of line parallelisation in two-sided assembly lines through
   obtained test results. The response of the overall system to the changes

   when it is required to be a polytree. Polynomial-time algorithms are
   known only for rare special cases, perhaps most notably for branchings,
   that is, polytrees in which the in-degree of every node is at most one.
   In this paper, we generalize this polynomial-time result to polytrees
   that can be turned into a branching by deleting a constant number of
   arcs. Our algorithm stems from a matroid intersection formulation. As
   the order of the polynomial time bound depends on the number of deleted
   arcs, the algorithm does not establish fixed-parameter tractability when
   parameterized by that number. We show that certain additional
   constraints on the sought polytree render the problem fixed-parameter
   tractable. We contrast this positive result by showing that if we
   parameterize by the number of deleted nodes, a somewhat more powerful
   parameter, the problem is not fixed-parameter tractable, subject to a
   complexity-theoretic assumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Classification of psychiatric disorders is becoming one of the major
   focuses of research using artificial intelligence approach. The
   combination of feature selection and classification methods generates
   satisfactory outcomes using biological biomarkers. The use of
   quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) cordance has enhanced the
   clinical utility of the EEG in psychiatric and neurological subjects.
   Trichotillomania (TTM), a kind of body focused repetitive behavior, is
   defined as a disorder characterized by repetitive hair pulling that
   results in noticeable hair loss. Phenomenological observations underline
   similarities between hair-pulling behaviors and compulsions seen in
   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Despite the recognized similarities
   between OCD and TTM, there is evidence of important differences between
   these two disorders. In order to dichotomize the subjects of each
   disorder, artificial intelligence approach was employed using
   quantitative EEG (QEEG) cordance values with 19 electrodes from 10 brain
   regions (prefrontal, frontocentral, central, left temporal, right
   temporal, left parietal, occipital, midline, left frontal and right
   frontal) in 4 frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and beta). Machine
   learning methods, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector
   machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and Naive Bayes (NB), were used
   in order to classify 39 TTM and 40 OCD patients. SVM, with its
   relatively better performance, was then combined with an improved ant
   colony optimization (IACO) approach in order to select more informative
   features with less iterations. The noteworthy performance of the hybrid
   approach underline that it is possible to discriminate OCD and TTM
   subjects with 81.04\% overall accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Although emergency department visit forecasting can be of use for nurse
   staff planning, previous research has focused on models that lacked
   sufficient resolution and realistic error metrics for these predictions
   to be applied in practice. Using data from a 1100-bed specialized care
   hospital with 553 000 patients assigned to its healthcare area,
   forecasts with different prediction horizons, from 2 to 24 weeks ahead,
   with an 8-hour granularity, using support vector regression, M5P, and
   stratified average time-series models were generated with an open-source
   software package. As overstaffing and understaffing errors have
   different implications, error metrics and potential personnel monetary
   savings were calculated with a custom validation scheme, which simulated
   subsequent generation of predictions during a 4-year period. Results
   were then compared with a generalized estimating equation regression.
   Support vector regression and M5P models were found to be superior to
   the stratified average model with a 95\% confidence interval. Our
   findings suggest that medium and severe understaffing situations could
   be reduced in more than an order of magnitude and average yearly savings
   of up to euro 683 500 could be achieved if dynamic nursing staff
   allocation was performed with support vector regression instead of the
   static staffing levels currently in use.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the representation of magnetic resonances of
   different parts of the human body, such as knees, spinal column, arms,
   elbows, etc., using ontologies. First, it maps the resonance images in a
   multimedia database. Then, automatically, using the SIFT pattern
   recognition algorithm, descriptors of the images stored in the database
   are extracted in order to recover useful data for the user; it uses the
   ontologies as an artificial intelligence tool and, in consequence,
   reduces generation of useless data. Why do we think this is an
   interesting task? Because, if the user requires information about any
   topics or (s) he has some illness or needs to undergo magnetic
   resonance, this tool will show him/her images and text to convey a
   better understanding, helping to obtain useful conclusions. Artificial
   intelligence techniques are used, such as machine learning, knowledge
   representation, and pattern recognition.
   The ontological relations introduced here are based on the common
   representation of language, using definition dictionaries, Roget's
   thesaurus, synonym dictionaries, and other resources The system
   generates an output in the OM ontological language {[}1]. This language
   represents a structure where our system adds the data scanned by the
   SIFT algorithm. The tests have been made in Spanish; however, thanks to
   the portability of our system, it is possible to extend the method to
   any language.}},

Title = {{Development of a self-healing soft pneumatic actuator: a first concept}},
Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Inspired by the intrinsic softness and the corresponding embodied
   intelligence principles, soft pneumatic actuators (SPA) have been
   developed, which ensure safe interaction in unstructured, unknown
   environments. Due to their intrinsic softness, these actuators have the
   ability to resist large mechanical impacts. However, the soft materials
   used in these structures are in general susceptible to damage caused by
   sharp objects found in the unstructured environments. This paper
   proposes to integrate a self-healing (SH-) mechanism in SPAs, such that
   cuts, tears and perforations in the actuator can be self-healed.
   Diels-Alder (DA-) polymers, covalent polymer network systems based on
   the thermoreversible DA-reaction, were selected and their mechanical, as
   well as SH-properties, are described. To evaluate the feasibility of
   developing an SPA constructed out of SH-material, a single cell
   prototype, a SH-soft pneumatic cell (SH-SPC), was constructed entirely
   out of DA-polymers. Exploiting the SH-property of the DA-polymers, a
   completely new shaping process is presented in this paper, referred to
   as `shaping through folding and self-healing'. 3D polygon structures,
   like the cubic SH-SPC, can be constructed by folding SH-polymer sheet.
   The sides of the structures can be sealed and made airtight using a
   SH-procedure at relatively low temperatures (<90 degrees C). Both the
   (thermo) mechanical and SH-properties of the SH-SPC prototype were
   experimentally validated and showed excellent performances. Macroscopic
   incisions in the prototype were completely healed using a SH-procedure
   (<70 degrees C). Starting from this single-cell prototype, it is
   straight-forward to develop a multi-cell prototype, the first SPA ever
   built completely out of SH-polymers.}},

Abstract = {{Although robotics has progressed to the extent that it has become
   relatively accessible with low-cost projects, there is still a need to
   create models that accurately represent the physical behavior of a
   robot. Creating a completely virtual platform allows us to test behavior
   algorithms such as those implemented using artificial intelligence, and
   additionally, it enables us to find potential problems in the physical
   design of the robot. The present work describes a methodology for the
   construction of a kinematic model and a simulation of the autonomous
   robot, specifically of an omni-directional wheeled robot. This paper
   presents the kinematic model development and its implementation using
   several tools. The result is a model that follows the kinematics of a
   triangular omni-directional mobile wheeled robot, which is then tested
   by using a 3D model imported from 3D Studio (R) and Matlab (R) for the
   simulation. The environment used for the experiment is very close to the
   real environment and reflects the kinematic characteristics of the
   robot.}},

Abstract = {{An advanced artificial intelligence (a ``superintelligence{''}) could
   pose a significant existential risk to humanity. Several research
   institutes have been set-up to address those risks. And there is an
   increasing number of academic publications analysing and evaluating
   their seriousness. Nick Bostrom's superintelligence: paths, dangers,
   strategies represents the apotheosis of this trend. In this article, I
   argue that in defending the credibility of AI risk, Bostrom makes an
   epistemic move that is analogous to one made by so-called sceptical
   theists in the debate about the existence of God. And while this analogy
   is interesting in its own right, what is more interesting are its
   potential implications. It has been repeatedly argued that sceptical
   theism has devastating effects on our beliefs and practices. Could it be
   that AI-doomsaying has similar effects? I argue that it could.
   Specifically, and somewhat paradoxically, I argue that it could amount
   to either a reductio of the doomsayers position, or an important and
   additional reason to join their cause. I use this paradox to suggest
   that the modal standards for argument in the superintelligence debate

Abstract = {{Can we sensibly attribute some of the happenings in our world to the
   agency of some of the things around us? We do this all the time, but
   there are conceptual challenges purporting to show that attributable
   agency, and specifically one of its most important subspecies, human
   free agency, is incoherent. We address these challenges in a novel way:
   rather than merely rebutting specific arguments, we discuss a concrete
   model that we claim positively illustrates attributable agency in an
   indeterministic setting. The model, recently introduced by one of the
   authors in the context of artificial intelligence, shows that an agent
   with a sufficiently complex memory organization can employ
   indeterministic happenings in a meaningful way. We claim that these
   considerations successfully counter arguments against the coherence of
   libertarian (indeterminism-based) free will.}},

Abstract = {{Machine learning models appear to be an attractive route towards
   tackling high-dimensional problems, particularly in areas where a lack
   of knowledge exists regarding the development of effective algorithms,
   and where programs must dynamically adapt to changing conditions. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of three machine
   learning tools for predicting stand volume of fast-growing forest
   plantations, based on statistical vegetation metrics extracted from an
   Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) survey. The forests used in this study
   were composed of 1138 ha of commercial plantations that consisted of
   hybrids of Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urophylla, managed for pulp
   production. Three machine learning tools were implemented: neural
   network (NN), random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SV); and
   their performance was compared to a regression model (RM). The RE and
   the RM presented an RMSE in the leave-one-out cross-validation of 31.80
   and 30.56 m(3) ha(-1) respectively. The NN and SV presented a higher
   RMSE than the others, equal to 64.44 and 65.30 m(3) ha(-1). The
   coefficient of determination and bias were similar to all modeling
   techniques. The ranking of ALS metrics based on their relative
   importance for the estimation of stand volume showed some differences.
   Rather than being limited to a subset of predictor variables, machine
   learning techniques explored the complete metrics set, looking for
   patterns between them and the dependent variable. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Along with the development of smart grids, the wide adoption of electric
   vehicles (EVs) is seen as a catalyst to the reduction of CO2 emissions
   and more intelligent transportation systems. In particular, EVs augment
   the grid with the ability to store energy at some points in the network
   and give it back at others and, therefore, help optimize the use of
   energy from intermittent renewable energy sources and let users refill
   their cars in a variety of locations. However, a number of challenges
   need to be addressed if such benefits are to be achieved. On the one
   hand, given their limited range and costs involved in charging EV
   batteries, it is important to design algorithms that will minimize costs
   and, at the same time, avoid users being stranded. On the other hand,
   collectives of EVs need to be organized in such a way as to avoid peaks
   on the grid that may result in high electricity prices and overload
   local distribution grids. In order to meet such challenges, a number of
   technological solutions have been proposed. In this paper, we focus on
   those that utilize artificial intelligence techniques to render EVs and
   the systems that manage collectives of EVs smarter. In particular, we
   provide a survey of the literature and identify the commonalities and
   key differences in the approaches. This allows us to develop a
   classification of key techniques and benchmarks that can be used to
   advance the state of the art in this space.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an advanced hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm (HMA) to
   solve the vehicle routing problem with backhauls and time windows
   (VRPBTW). The VRPBTW is an extension of the vehicle routing problem with
   time windows (VRPTW) and the vehicle routing problem with backhauls
   (VRPB) that includes capacity, backhaul and time window constraints. In
   this problem, the customers are divided into two subsets consisting of
   linehaul and backhaul customers. Each vehicle starts from the depot, and
   goods are delivered from the depot to the linehaul customers. Goods are
   subsequently returned to the depot from the backhaul customers. The
   objective is to minimize the total distance that satisfies all of the
   constraints. The proposed meta-heuristic method is tested on a problem
   data set obtained from Solomon's VRPTW benchmark problems which includes
   25, 50 and 100 demand nodes. The results of the computational studies
   show that the HMA outperforms the existing studies and provides better
   solutions than the best known solutions in practical computational

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{713-724}},

Abstract = {{Preferences play a crucial role in the theory of rationality, and
   therefore also to computational social choice and artificial
   intelligence. In formal models it is usually assumed that preferences
   are primitive objects, and little concern is devoted to the question of
   how they are formed or where they come from. Recent work in rational
   choice theory challenges this assumption, however, and aims to give more
   internal structure to the notion of a preference. The focus so far has
   been on modeling faculties of individual agents, such as their mood,
   mindset, and motivating reasons. In this paper we contribute to this
   development by developing a modal logic for reasoning about preferences
   that depend on a set of motivationally salient properties. The main
   result is a translation showing how reasoning in this logic can be
   captured by reasoning in a standard modal logic (KT with universal
   modality). It follows that reasoning systems and algorithms developed
   for modal logic (with universal modality) can be employed for reasoning
   about reason-based preferences. We then discuss how the approach can be
   generalised to the multi-agent case, and allows us to reason about
   agents who disagree because they are motivated by different factors, and
   who might be able to reach consensus simply by changing their
   perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Since the advent of artificial intelligence, researchers have been
   trying to create machines that emulate human behaviour. Back in the
   1960s however, Licklider (IRE Trans Hum Factors Electron 4-11, 1960)
   believed that machines and computers were just part of a scale in which
   computers were on one side and humans on the other (human computation).
   After almost a decade of active research into human computation and
   crowdsourcing, this paper presents a survey of crowdsourcing human
   computation systems, with the focus being on solving micro-tasks and
   complex tasks. An analysis of the current state of the art is performed
   from a technical standpoint, which includes a systematized description
   of the terminologies used by crowdsourcing platforms and the
   relationships between each term. Furthermore, the similarities between
   task-oriented crowdsourcing platforms are described and presented in a
   process diagram according to a proposed classification. Using this
   analysis as a stepping stone, this paper concludes with a discussion of
   challenges and possible future research directions.}},

Abstract = {{Game tree search is a classical problemin the field of game theory and
   artificial intelligence. Fast game tree search algorithm is critical for
   computer games asking for real-time responses. In this paper, we focus
   on how to leverage massive parallelism capabilities of GPU to accelerate
   the speed of game tree search algorithms and propose a concise and
   general parallel game tree search algorithm on GPU. The performance
   model of our algorithm is presented and analyzed theoretically. We
   implement the algorithm for two real computer games called Connect6 and
   Chess. We also use these two games to verify the effectiveness and
   efficiency of our algorithm. Experiments support our theoretical results
   and show good performance of our approach. Compared to classical
   CPU-based game tree search algorithms, our algorithm can achieve
   speedups of 89.95x for Connect6 and 11.43x for Chess, in case of no
   pruning. When pruning is considered, which means the practical
   performance of our algorithm, the speedup can reach about 10.58x for
   Connect6 and 7.26x for Chess. The insight of our work is that using GPU
   is a feasible way to improve the performance of game tree search
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Emotions play an important role in human interactions. They can be
   integrated into the computer system to make human-computer interaction
   (HCI) more effective. Affective computing is an innovative computational
   modeling and detecting user's emotions to optimize system responses in
   HCI. However, there is a trade-off between recognition accuracy and
   real-time performance in some of the methods such as processing the
   facial expressions, human voice and body gestures. Other methods lack
   efficiency and usability in real-world applications such as natural
   language processing and electroencephalography signals. To accomplish a
   reliable, usable and high-performance system, this paper proposes an
   intelligent hybrid approach to recognize users' emotions by using easily
   accessible and low computational cost input devices including keyboard,
   mouse (touch pad: single touch) and touch screen display (single touch).
   Using the proposed approach, the system is developed and trained in a
   supervised mode by artificial neural network and support vector machine
   (SVM) techniques. The result shows an increase in accuracy of 6 \%
   (93.20 \%) by SVM in comparison with the currently existing methods. It
   is a significant contribution to show new directions of future research
   in emotion recognition, user modeling and emotional intelligence.}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on the use of an Ant colony optimization (ACO) based
   approach to the problem of 3D object segmentation. The ACO metaheuristic
   uses a set of agents (artificial ants) to explore a search space. This
   kind of metaheuristic can be classified as a Natural computing
   non-deterministic technique, which is frequently used when the size of
   the search space makes the use of analytic mathematical tools
   unaffordable. The exploration is influenced by heuristic information,
   determined by each particular problem. Agents communicate with each
   other through the pheromone trails, which act as the common memory for
   the colony. In the approach presented, the agents start their
   exploration at the outer contour of an object. The final result is given
   after a certain number of generations, when the particular solutions of
   the agents converge to create the global paths followed by the colony.
   These paths coherently connect the object's high curvature areas,
   facilitating the segmentation process. The advantage of this convergence
   mechanism is that it avoids the problem of over-segmentation by
   detecting regions based on the global structure of the object and not
   just on local information.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a methodology for the analysis of functional changes
   in brain activity across different conditions and different groups of
   subjects. This analysis is based on the recently proposed NeuCube
   spiking neural network (SNN) framework and more specifically on the
   analysis of the connectivity of a NeuCube model trained with
   electroencephalography (EEG) data. The case study data used to
   illustrate this method is EEG data collected from three groups subjects
   with opiate addiction, patients undertaking methadone maintenance
   treatment, and non-drug users/healthy control group. The proposed method
   classifies more accurately the EEG data than traditional statistical and
   artificial intelligence (AI) methods and can be used to predict response
   to treatment and dose-related drug effect. But more importantly, the
   method can be used to compare functional brain activities of different
   subjects and the changes of these activities as a result of treatment,
   which is a step towards a better understanding of both the EEG data and
   the brain processes that generated it. The method can also be used for a
   wide range of applications, such as a better understanding of disease
   progression or aging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As an effective way for crowd control and management, crowd density
   estimation is an important research topic in artificial intelligence
   applications. Since the existing methods are hard to satisfy the
   accuracy and speed requirements of engineering applications, we propose
   to estimate crowd density by an optimized convolutional neural network
   (ConvNet). The contributions are twofold: first, convolutional neural
   network is first introduced for crowd density estimation. The estimation
   speed is significantly accelerated by removing some network connections
   according to the observation of the existence of similar feature maps.
   Second, a cascade of two ConvNet classifier has been designed, which
   improves both of the accuracy and speed. The method is tested on three
   data sets: PETS\_2009, a Subway image sequence and a ground truth image
   sequence. Experiments confirm the good performance of the method on the
   same data sets compared with the state of the art works. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Research on Engineering Knowledge Management (EKM) has identified
   challenges with the systematic source of engineering knowledge for the
   design process optimisation. In this context, Knowledge-Based
   Engineering (KBE) is acknowledged as a key area within the EKM field and
   designated by the research community as a potential solution to carry
   out the effective capture and reuse of expert knowledge. However, papers
   on KBE for knowledge sourcing are not abundant in the literature and
   they are also dispersed. From this perspective, this research is an
   effort to further consolidate the learning gained on industrial practice
   on how engineering knowledge can be effectively sourced. This is
   achieved by realising a research survey, where using the resulting
   insights KBE practice reaching aerospace engineering offices shall be
   more efficiently delivered through fast and accurate knowledge
   extraction and encoding into usable methods and tools. The research
   findings provided by literature survey confirmed the existence of a
   research gap on knowledge sourcing; and more precisely they underlined
   the need for an extended KBE development process which integrates
   Artificial Intelligence (Al) tools and expert intervention to
   systematically manage the knowledge (using the KM methods and tools)
   efficiently captured and modelled (employing Al algorithms and expert
   involvement). Therefore, this paper concludes that there is a need for
   further research on the knowledge sourcing KBE aspect and presents the
   integration of KBE systems and Al implementations as a potential
   solution to develop the extended KBE development process requested by
   the industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The continuous artificial bee colony algorithm for binary optimization}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{15-23}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, one of the swarm intelligence
   algorithms, has been proposed for continuous optimization, inspired
   intelligent behaviors of real honey bee colony. For the optimization
   problems having binary structured solution space, the basic ABC
   algorithm should be modified because its basic version is proposed for
   solving continuous optimization problems. In this study, an adapted
   version of ABC, ABC(bin) for short, is proposed for binary optimization.
   In the proposed model for solving binary optimization problems, despite
   the fact that artificial agents in the algorithm works on the continuous
   solution space, the food source position obtained by the artificial
   agents is converted to binary values, before the objective function
   specific for the problem is evaluated. The accuracy and performance of
   the proposed approach have been examined on well-known 15 benchmark
   instances of uncapacitated facility location problem, and the results
   obtained by ABC(bin), are compared with the results of continuous
   particle swarm optimization (CPSO), binary particle swarm optimization
   (BPSO), improved binary particle swarm optimization (IBPSO), binary
   artificial bee colony algorithm (binABC) and discrete artificial bee
   colony algorithm (DisABC). The performance of ABC(bin) is also analyzed
   under the change of control parameter values. The experimental results
   and comparisons show that proposed ABC(bin) is an alternative and simple
   binary optimization tool in terms of solution quality and robustness.

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{310}},
Pages = {{130-148}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{Analysis and detection of human behaviors from video sequences has
   became recently a very hot research topic in computer vision and
   artificial intelligence. Indeed, human behavior understanding plays a
   fundamental role in several innovative application domains such as smart
   video surveillance, ambient intelligence and content-based video
   information retrieval. However, the uncertainty and vagueness that
   typically characterize human daily activities make frameworks for human
   behavior analysis (HBA) hard to design and develop. In order to bridge
   this gap, this paper proposes a hierarchical architecture, based on a
   tracking algorithm, time-delay neural networks and fuzzy inference
   systems, aimed at improving the performance of current MBA systems in
   terms of scalability, robustness and effectiveness in behavior
   detection. Precisely, the joint use of the aforementioned methodologies
   enables both a quantitative and qualitative behavioral analysis that
   efficiently face the intrinsic people/objects tracking imprecision and
   provide context aware and semantic capabilities for better identifying a
   given activity. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed framework
   have been verified by using the well-known CAVIAR dataset and comparing
   our system's performance with other similar approaches working on the

Abstract = {{Accurate simulation of the effects of integrating new technologies into
   a complex system is critical to the modernisation of large
   infrastructure problems. This is especially true in the modernisation of
   our antiquated air traffic system, where there exist many layers of
   interacting procedures, controls, and automation all designed to
   cooperate with human operators. Additions of even simple new
   technologies may result in unexpected emergent behaviour due to complex
   human/machine interactions. One approach is to create high-fidelity
   human models coming from the field of human factors that can simulate a
   rich set of behaviours. However, such models are difficult to produce,
   especially to show unexpected emergent behaviour coming from many human
   operators interacting simultaneously within a complex system. Instead,
   we introduce an alternate approach. Instead of engineering complex human
   models, we directly model the emergent behaviour with relatively simple
   goal-directed agents. In this model, each autonomous agent in a system
   pursues individual goals, and the high-level behaviour of the system
   emerges from the interactions, foreseen or unforeseen, between the
   agents/actors. We show that this method is capable of reflecting the
   integration of new technologies in a historical case, and apply the same
   methodology for a possible future technology. Finally, we show how these
   high-level simulated behaviours compare to actual deployed air traffic
   control mechanisms in use today.}},

Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{159}},

Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{The bee colony optimization (BCO) algorithm is proved to be one of the
   fast, robust and efficient global search heuristics in tackling
   different practical problems. Considering BCO algorithm in this paper,
   we utilize it for the data clustering, a fundamental problem that
   frequently arises in many applications. However, we discovered some
   obstacles in directly applying the ancient BCO to address the clustering
   problem and managed to change some basic behaviors of this swarm
   algorithm. In particular, we present an improved bee colony optimization
   algorithm, dubbed IBCO, by introducing cloning and fairness concepts
   into the BCO algorithm and make it more efficient for data clustering.
   These features give BCO very powerful and balanced exploration and
   exploitation capabilities to effectively guide the search process toward
   the proximity of the high quality solutions. In particular, the cloning
   feature allows it to take advantage of experiences gained from previous
   generations when generating new solutions. The problem of getting stuck
   in local optima still laid bare in the proposed improved version. As a
   result, to overcome the shortage of this swarm algorithm in searching
   locally, we hybridize it with the k-means algorithm to take advantage of
   fine tuning power of the widely used k-means algorithm which
   demonstrates good result in local searches. We propose four different
   hybridized algorithms based on IBCO and k-means algorithms and
   investigate the clustering results and convergence behavior of them. We
   empirically demonstrate that our hybrid algorithms alleviate the problem
   of sticking in a local solution even for large and high dimensional data
   sets such as document clustering. The results show that proposed
   algorithms are robust enough to be used in many applications compared to
   k-means and other recently proposed evolutionary based clustering
   algorithms including genetic, particle swarm optimization, ant colony,
   and bee based algorithms. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The task of design, planning and operation of manufacturing networks is

   a toolbox approach. The Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing
   metaheuristic methods are used together with an Artificial Intelligence
   method, called Intelligent Search Algorithm. A multi-criteria decision
   making procedure is carried out for the evaluation of the quality of
   alternative manufacturing network configurations using multiple
   conflicting criteria including dynamic complexity, reliability, cost,
   time, quality and environmental footprint. A comparison of the
   performance of each method based on the quality of the solutions that it
   provided is carried out. The statistical design of experiments robust
   engineering technique is used for the calibration of the adjustable
   parameters of the methods. Moreover, the impact of demand fluctuation to
   the operational performance of the alternative networks, expressed
   thorough a dynamic complexity indicator, is investigated through
   simulation. The developed framework is validated through a real life

Abstract = {{Metacognition has been used in artificial intelligence to increase the
   level of autonomy of intelligent systems. However the design of systems
   with metacognitive capabilities is a difficult task due to the number
   and complexity of processes involved. This paper presents a
   domain-specific visual language specifically developed for modeling
   metacognition in intelligent systems called M++. In M++ the
   specifications of the cognitive level (object-level) and metacognitive
   level (meta-level) are supported in a metamodel configured according to
   the standard Meta-Object Facility (MOF) of Model-Driven Architecture
   (MDA) methodology. M++ allows the generation of metacognitive diagrams
   in a visual editor named Meta Think. A validation process was conducted
   to ensure the reliability of M++ in terms of quality of the notation and
   consistency of generated models. The validation was performed using two
   techniques: (i) empirical study and (ii) model tracing. The results
   given in the experimental study demonstrate that M++ is a useful
   notation for the process of modeling metacognitive components in
   intelligent systems. Metacognitive models generated from the validation
   process using the Tracing technique were consistent with the MOF-based
   metannodel. M++ contribute to cognitive architecture research adding
   precision to metacognitive concepts and enabling cognitive architecture
   researchers to do fast and exploratory prototyping of nnetacognitive
   systems using Meta Think tool. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this article, Load Frequency Control (LFC) of three area unequal
   interconnected thermal, wind and Hydro power generating units has been
   developed with Proportional-Integral (PI) controller under
   MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. Further, the PI controller gains values
   that optimized using trial and error method with two different objective
   functions, namely the Integral Time Square Error (ITSE) and the Integral
   Time Absolute Error (ITAE). The performance of ITAE objective function
   based PI controller is compared with the ITSE objective function
   optimized PI controller. Analysis reveals that the ITSE optimized
   controller gives more superior performance than ITAE based controller
   during one percent Step Load Perturbation (1\% SLP) in area 1 (thermal
   area). In addition, Proportional-Integral -Derivative (PID) controller
   is employed to improve the same power system performance. The controller
   gain values are optimized using Artificial Intelligence technique based
   Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. The simulation performance
   compares the ACO-PID controller to the conventional PI. The results
   proved that the proposed optimization technique based the ACO-PID
   controller provides a superior control performance compared to the PI
   controller. As the system using the ACO-PID controller yield minimum
   overshoot, undershoot and settling time compared to the conventional PI
   controlled equipped system performance.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is a serious disease across the world, and it is one of
   the largest causes of cancer death for women. The traditional diagnosis
   is not only time consuming but also easily affected. Hence, artificial
   intelligence (AI), especially neural networks, has been widely used to
   assist to detect cancer. However, in recent years, the computational
   ability of a neuron has attracted more and more attention. The main
   computational capacity of a neuron is located in the dendrites. In this
   paper, a novel neuron model with dendritic nonlinearity (NMDN) is
   proposed to classify breast cancer in the Wisconsin Breast Cancer
   Database (WBCD). In NMDN, the dendrites possess nonlinearity when
   realizing the excitatory synapses, inhibitory synapses, constant-1
   synapses and constant-0 synapses instead of being simply weighted.
   Furthermore, the nonlinear interaction among the synapses on a dendrite
   is defined as a product of the synaptic inputs. The soma adds all of the
   products of the branches to produce an output. A back-propagation-based
   learning algorithm is introduced to train the NMDN. The performance of
   the NMDN is compared with classic back propagation neural networks
   (BPNNs). Simulation results indicate that NMDN possesses superior
   capability in terms of the accuracy, convergence rate, stability and
   area under the ROC curve (AUC). Moreover, regarding ROC, for continuum
   values, the existing 0-connections branches after evolving can be
   eliminated from the dendrite morphology to release computational load,
   but with no influence on the performance of classification. The results
   disclose that the computational ability of the neuron has been
   undervalued, and the proposed NMDN can be an interesting choice for
   medical researchers in further research.}},

Title = {{Experiments on Human-in-the-Loop Coordination for Multirobot System With
   Task Abstraction}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the experimental validation of a multiple mobile
   robot system with human-in-the-loop coordination. It has been proposed
   that the control framework for networked autonomous robots can be
   augmented by artificial functions for task abstraction, so that a human
   operator is able to operate a group of robots remotely. By utilizing the
   redundancy of a multirobot system with task-space control, the group of
   mobile robots, in addition to achieving the missions tele-controlled by
   the human, can perform added tasks simultaneously. In this paper, the
   human-robot cooperative control system was validated experimentally
   through a robotic manipulator and a group of mobile robots by taking
   into account communication delays. Multirobot coverage control,
   formation control, and cooperative transportation were demonstrated, to
   validate the performance and efficiency of the robotic control system
   with human-in-the-loop coordination.
   Note to Practitioners-A system of multiple mobile robots has been shown
   to be a powerful method to accomplish complicated tasks without using
   sophisticated robotic systems. Although a network of robots can fulfill
   missions that cannot be performed by individual robots separately, in
   the absence of human input, most multirobot systems lack the flexibility
   to accomplish other than predefined tasks. Enduing multirobot systems
   with the intelligence of a human being has been foreseen as a key
   technique for enhancing the performance and efficiency of automated
   robotic systems. This topic in the paper was inspired by the practical
   problems of multirobot cooperation in a hazardous environment and
   cooperative transportation in the manufacturing industry. To address
   some of the prime issues in question, we directed our efforts to develop
   a human-in-the-loop system that can provide multiple robotic systems
   with the ability to handle a rapidly changing environment, through
   autonomous cooperation and position regulation in real time. This
   research is expected to make significant contributions in mobile sensor
   and actuator networks for automation, as well as increase the autonomy
   and motion flexibility in micromanipulation, outer-space construction,
   and unknown areas of exploration in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the hardware implementation of the direct torque control
   based on the fuzzy logic technique of induction motor on the
   Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is presented. Due to its
   complexity, the fuzzy logic technique implemented on a digital system
   like the DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and microcontroller is
   characterized by a calculating delay. This delay is due to the
   processing speed which depends on the system complexity. The limitation
   of these solutions is inevitable. To solve this problem, an alternative
   digital solution is used, based on the FPGA, which is characterized by a
   fast processing speed, to take the advantage of the performances of the
   fuzzy logic technique in spite of its complex computation. The
   Conventional Direct Torque Control (CDTC) of the induction machine faces
   problems, like the high stator flux, electromagnetic torque ripples, and
   stator current distortions. To overcome the CDTC problems many methods
   are used such as the space vector modulation which is sensitive to the
   parameters variations of the machine, the increase in the switches
   inverter number which increases the cost of the inverter, and the
   artificial intelligence. In this paper an intelligent technique based on
   the fuzzy logic is used because it is allows controlling the systems
   without knowing the mathematical model. Also, we use a new method based
   on the Xilinx system generator for the hardware implementation of Direct
   Torque Fuzzy Control (DTFC) on the FPGA. The simulation results of the
   DTFC are compared to those of the CDTC. The comparison results
   illustrate the reduction in the torque and stator flux ripples of the
   DTFC and show the Xilinx Virtex V FPGA performances in terms of
   execution time.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for ubiquitous information processing over the Web has called
   for the development of context-aware recommender systems capable of
   dealing with the problems of information overload and information
   filtering. Contemporary recommender systems harness context-awareness
   with the personalization to offer the most accurate recommendations
   about different products, services, and resources. However, such systems
   come across the issues, such as sparsity, cold start, and scalability
   that lead to imprecise recommendations. Computational Intelligence (CI)
   techniques not only improve recommendation accuracy but also
   substantially mitigate the aforementioned issues. Large numbers of
   context-aware recommender systems are based on the CI techniques, such
   as: (a) fuzzy sets, (b) artificial neural networks, (c) evolutionary
   computing, (d) swarm intelligence, and (e) artificial immune systems.
   This survey aims to encompass the state-of-the-art context-aware
   recommender systems based on the CI techniques. Taxonomy of the CI
   techniques is presented and challenges particular to the context-aware
   recommender systems are also discussed. Moreover, the ability of each of
   the CI techniques to deal with the aforesaid challenges is also
   highlighted. Furthermore, the strengths and weaknesses of each of the CI
   techniques used in context-aware recommender systems are discussed and a

Abstract = {{This paper studies data-driven short-term load forecasting, where
   historic data are used to predict the expected load for the next 24 h.
   Our focus is to simplify and automate the estimation and analysis of
   various forecasting models. We propose a three-stage approach to load
   forecasting, consisting of preprocessing, forecasting, and
   postprocessing, where the forecasting stage uses evolution to
   automatically set the parameters for each model. In our implementation,
   the preprocessing stage includes removal of daily and weekly seasonality
   by a nonparametric method. This seasonal pattern is added in the
   postprocessing stage. The system allows for easy exploration of several
   forecasting models, without the need to have in-depth knowledge of how
   to obtain the best performance for each model. We apply the method to
   several forecasting algorithms and on three datasets: 1) distribution
   substation; 2) GEFCom 2012; and 3) a transmission level dataset. We find
   that the forecasting algorithms considered produce significantly more
   accurate forecasts when combined with our proposed preprocessing stage
   compared with applying the same algorithms directly on the raw data. We
   also find that the parameter values chosen by evolution often provide
   insights into the interplay between the different datasets and forecast
   models. Software is available online.}},

Abstract = {{We present a way to automatically plan student-oriented learning
   contents in Moodle. Rather than offering the same contents for all
   students, we provide personalized contents according to the students'
   background and learning objectives. Although curriculum personalization
   can be faced in several ways, we focus on artificial intelligence (AI)
   planning as a very useful formalism for mapping actions, i.e. learning
   contents, in terms of preconditions (precedence relationships) and
   causal effects to find plans, i.e. learning paths that best fit the

Abstract = {{Many inference tasks in pattern recognition and artificial intelligence
   lead to partition functions in which addition and multiplication are
   abstract binary operations forming a commutative semiring. By
   generalizing max-sum diffusion (one of convergent message passing
   algorithms for approximate MAP inference in graphical models), we
   propose an iterative algorithm to upper bound such partition functions
   over commutative semirings. The iteration of the algorithm is remarkably
   simple: change any two factors of the partition function such that their
   product remains the same and their overlapping marginals become equal.
   In many commutative semirings, repeating this iteration for different
   pairs of factors converges to a fixed point when the overlapping
   marginals of every pair of factors coincide. We call this state marginal
   consistency. During that, an upper bound on the partition function
   monotonically decreases. This abstract algorithm unifies several
   existing algorithms, including max-sum diffusion and basic costraint
   propagation (or local consistency) algorithms in constraint programming.
   We further construct a hierarchy of marginal consistencies of
   increasingly higher levels and show than any such level can be enforced
   by adding identity factors of higher arity (order). Finally, we discuss
   instances of the framework for several semirings, including the
   distributive lattice and the max-sum and sum-product semirings.}},

Abstract = {{Calls for interdisciplinary collaboration have become increasingly
   common in the face of large-scale complex problems (including climate
   change, economic inequality, and education, among others); however,
   outcomes of such collaborations have been mixed, due, among other
   things, to the so-called translation problem in interdisciplinary
   research. This article presents a potential solution: an empirical
   approach to quantitatively measure both the degree and nature of
   differences among disciplinary tongues through the social and epistemic
   terms used (a research area we refer to as discourse epistemetrics), in
   a case study comparing dissertations in philosophy, psychology, and
   physics. Using a support-vector model of machine learning to classify
   disciplines based on relative frequencies of social and epistemic terms,
   we were able to markedly improve accuracy over a random selection
   baseline (distinguishing between disciplines with as high as 90\%
   accuracy) as well as acquire sets of most indicative terms for each
   discipline by their relative presence or absence. These lists were then
   considered in light of findings of sociological and epistemological
   studies of disciplines and found to validate the approach's measure of
   social and epistemic disciplinary identities and contrasts. Based on the
   findings of our study, we conclude by considering the beneficiaries of
   research in this area, including bibliometricians, students, and science
   policy makers, among others, as well as laying out a research program
   that expands the number of disciplines, considers shifts in
   socio-epistemic identities over time and applies these methods to
   nonacademic epistemological communities (e.g., political groups).}},

Abstract = {{The task assignment problem is an important topic in multi-agent systems
   research. Distributed real-time systems must accommodate a number of
   communication tasks, and the difficulty in building such systems lies in
   task assignment (i.e., where to place the tasks). This paper presents a
   novel approach that is based on artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) to
   address dynamic task assignment problems in multi-agent cooperative
   systems. The initial bee population (solution) is constructed by the
   initial task assignment algorithm through a greedy heuristic. Each bee
   is formed by the number of tasks and agents, and the number of employed
   bees is equal to the number of onlooker bees. After being generated, the
   solution is improved through a local search process called greedy
   selection. This process is implemented by onlooker and employed bees. In
   greedy selection, if the fitness value of the candidate source is
   greater than that of the current source, the bee forgets the current
   source and memorizes the new candidate source. Experiments are performed
   with two test suites (TIG representing real-life tree and Fork-Join
   problems and randomly generated TIGs). Results are compared with other
   nature-inspired approaches, such as genetic and particle swarm
   optimization algorithms, in terms of CPU time and communication cost.
   The findings show that ABC improves these two criteria significantly
   with respect to the other approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The selection of the new requirements which should be included in the
   development of the release of a software product is an important issue
   for software companies. This problem is known in the literature as the
   Next Release Problem (NRP). It is an NP-hard problem which
   simultaneously addresses two apparently contradictory objectives: the
   total cost of including the selected requirements in the next release of
   the software package, and the overall satisfaction of a set of customers
   who have different opinions about the priorities which should be given
   to the requirements, and also have different levels of importance within
   the company. Moreover, in the case of managing real instances of the
   problem, the proposed solutions have to satisfy certain interaction
   constraints which arise among some requirements. In this paper, the NRP
   is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem with two
   objectives (cost and satisfaction) and three constraints (types of
   interactions). A multiobjective swarm intelligence metaheuristic is
   proposed to solve two real instances generated from data provided by
   experts. Analysis of the results showed that the proposed algorithm can
   efficiently generate high quality solutions. These were evaluated by
   comparing them with different proposals (in terms of multiobjective
   metrics). The results generated by the present approach surpass those
   generated in other relevant work in the literature (e.g. our technique
   can obtain a HV of over 60\% for the most complex dataset managed, while
   the other approaches published cannot obtain an HV of more than 40\% for
   the same dataset). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   productivity among the employees. In practice, there are many possible
   errors or biases in the performance appraisal process. These errors
   affect the objectivity of the appraisal to a large extent. The most
   common errors in appraisal include the Halo Effect and Horn Effect,
   leniency Error (Loose rater), the Error of Strictness (Tight rater), the
   Central Tendency Error, the Recency Effect, the Contrast Error and the
   Similarity (similar-to-me) Effect. The aim of this research project is
   to develop an intelligent IT system to address the issues of existing
   employee appraisal system. The system would be seamless and reduce human
   intervention to minimal. The system can be realized as a dashboard.
   Outcome of this research can be applied in today's businesses. The
   design of the system mentioned here is a process to ensure that the
   rater bias is limited. This type of system would be more beneficial for
   larger organizations with thousands of employees. A limitation could be
   that this type of application can be overhead for small companies.}},

Abstract = {{Word semantic relatedness measure plays an important role in many
   applications of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence.
   In recent years the measures based on WordNet have shown its talents and
   attracted great concern. Many measures have been proposed to achieve the
   best expression possible for the degree of semantic relatedness of
   words. In this paper, we consider two different modified measures for
   computing the semantic relatedness between two words based on the
   path-based approach. The first measure introduces the maximum node path
   into the classical path-based method to compute the relatedness of words
   from ontology hierarchy; it mainly exploits edge-counting technique. The
   second one takes the definition and semantic relationships of synsets
   into account; it is based on the assumption that the explicit and
   implicit semantic relationships between synsets impose equally
   importance factors in the word relatedness measure. The experimental
   results using the proposed methods on common datasets show that our
   measures yields into better levels of performance compared to several
   classical methods. In addition, the second approach performed better
   than the first one.}},

Abstract = {{The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a swarm intelligence
   algorithm inspired by the intelligent foraging behavior of a honeybee
   swarm. In recent years, several ABC variants that modify some components
   of the original ABC algorithm have been proposed. Although there are
   some comparison studies in the literature, the individual contribution
   of each proposed modification is often unknown. In this paper, the
   proposed modifications are tested with a systematic experimental study
   that by a component-wise analysis tries to identify their impact on
   algorithm performance. This study is done on two benchmark sets in
   continuous optimization. In addition to this analysis, two new variants
   of ABC algorithms for each of the two benchmark sets are proposed. To do
   so, the best components are selected for each step of the Composite ABC
   algorithms. The performance of the proposed algorithms were compared
   against that of ten recent ABC algorithms, as well as against several
   recent state-of-the-art algorithms. The comparison results showed that
   our proposed algorithms outperform other ABC algorithms. Moreover, the
   composite ABC algorithms are superior to several state-of-the-art
   algorithms proposed in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Large formal mathematical libraries consist of millions of atomic
   inference steps that give rise to a corresponding number of proved
   statements (lemmas). Analogously to the informal mathematical practice,
   only a tiny fraction of such statements is named and reused in later
   proofs by formal mathematicians. In this work, we suggest and implement
   criteria defining the estimated usefulness of the HOL Light lemmas for
   proving further theorems. We use these criteria to mine the large
   inference graph of the lemmas in the HOL Light and Flyspeck libraries,
   adding up to millions of the best lemmas to the pool of statements that
   can be reused in later proofs. We show that in combination with
   learning-based relevance filtering, such methods significantly
   strengthen automated theorem proving of new conjectures over large
   formal mathematical libraries such as Flyspeck. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Ontology is the backbone of the Semantic Web, helping users search for
   relevant resources from the Web of linked data. The existing
   context-free mapping approach between tags and concepts fails to address
   the problems of social synonymy and social polysemy when ontologies are
   induced from folksonomies. The novel contributions of this paper are
   threefold. First, grounded in the cognitively motivated category utility
   measure, a novel basic-level concept mining algorithm is developed to
   construct semantically rich concept vectors to alleviate the problem of
   social synonymy. Second, contextual aspects of ontology learning are
   exploited via probabilistic topic modeling to address the problem of
   social polysemy. Third, a novel context-sensitive domain ontology
   learning algorithm that combines link- and content-based semantic
   analysis is developed to identify both taxonomic and associative
   relations among concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first successful research that exploits a cognitively motivated method
   to learn context-sensitive domain ontologies from folksonomies. By using
   the Open Directory Project ontology as a benchmark, we examined the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithms based on social annotations
   crawled from three different folksonomy sites. Our experimental results
   show that the proposed ontology learning system significantly
   outperforms the best baseline system by 13.83\% in terms of taxonomic
   F-measure. The practical implication of our research is that
   high-quality ontologies are constructed with minimal human intervention
   to facilitate concept-driven retrieval of linked data and the
   knowledge-based interoperability among enterprises.}},

Abstract = {{In artificial intelligence, there are many methods for knowledge
   representation. One of the effective models is the Computational Object
   Knowledge Base model (COKB model), which can be used to represent the
   total knowledge and to design the knowledge base component of practical
   intelligent systems. Besides, reasoning methods also play an important
   role in knowledge base systems. In fact, a popular form of knowledge
   domain is knowledge about function and operations. These knowledge
   domains have many practical applications, especially in educational
   applications, such as Solid Geometry, Analytic Geometry. However, the
   current methods cannot reason on knowledge about Function and Operators.
   In this paper, we will present a reasoning method to solve problems on
   COKB model. These problems are related to knowledge about Functions and
   Operators. Also, this method has been applied to design some intelligent
   systems in education. Using this reasoning method, systems can solve
   problems in some educational knowledge domains automatically with their

   forth. Many fields of study utilize the notion, including programming,
   communication (e.g., Shannon-Weaver communication model), software
   modeling, artificial intelligence, and knowledge representation. This
   paper focuses on two approaches that explicitly assert a flow-based
   paradigm: flow-based programming (FBP) and flowthing modeling (FM). The
   first is utilized in programming and the latter in modeling (e.g.,
   software development). Each produces a diagrammatic representation, and
   these are compared. The purpose is to promote progress in a flow-based
   paradigm and its utilization in the area of computer science. The
   resultant analysis highlights the fact that FBP and FM can benefit from
   each other's methodology.}},

Abstract = {{The article shows an omnidirectional mobile platform control using the
   artificial intelligence techinique of Fuzzy Logic; the control allows a
   practical and reliable driving control of 4 omnidirectional wheels. The
   control module is implemented in FPGA allowing having an independent and
   autonomous single chip system out of a central computer dependence to be
   used in different applications like service robots platforms. An
   additional feature is performed by using Bluetooth communication with a
   cellular phone as the handset control device. Driving movements for the
   mobile platform is limited for eight directions, a Fuzzy Logic module
   controls the travelling of the platform with independent movements for
   each wheel, physical feedback is implemented by using electronic
   decoders, and experimental results were achieved with an additional
   feature of a handset device control based on a smartphone OS Android
   with Bluetooth communication. Not using external software and having a
   system using an artificial intelligence technique implemented in fast
   hardware, gives the system robust and reliable control capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{An important research topic in artificial intelligence is automatic
   sensing and inferencing of contextual information, which is used to
   build computer models or the user's activity. One approach to building
   such activity-aware systems is the notion of activity-based computing
   (ABC). ABC is a computing paradigm that has been applied in personal
   information-management applications as well as in ubiquitous,
   multidevice, and interactive surface computing. ABC has emerged as a
   response to the traditional application-and file-centered computing
   paradigm, which is oblivious to a notion of a user's activity spanning
   heterogeneous devices, multiple applications, services, and information
   sources. In this article, we present ABC as an approach to contextualize
   information, and present our research into designing activity-based

Abstract = {{Growth in energy demands, coupled with the need for clean energy, are
   likely to make solar cells an important part of future energy resources.
   In particular, cells entirely made of metal oxides (MOs) have the
   potential to provide clean and affordable energy if their power
   conversion efficiencies are improved. Such improvements require the
   development of new MOs which could benefit from combining combinatorial
   material sciences for producing solar cells libraries with data mining
   tools to direct synthesis efforts. In this work we developed a data
   mining work-flow and applied it to the analysis of two recently reported
   solar cell libraries based on Titanium and Copper oxides. Our results
   demonstrate that QSAR models with good prediction statistics for
   multiple solar cells properties could be developed and that these models
   highlight important factors affecting these properties in accord with
   experimental findings. The resulting models are therefore suitable for
   designing better solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a sampling-based search algorithm that
   is state of the art in a variety of games. In many domains, its Monte
   Carlo rollouts of entire games give it a strategic advantage over
   traditional depth-limited minimax search with pruning. These rollouts
   can often detect long-term consequences of moves, freeing the programmer
   from having to capture these consequences in a heuristic evaluation
   function. But due to its highly selective tree, MCTS runs a higher risk
   than full-width minimax search of missing individual moves and falling
   into traps in tactical situations. This paper proposes MCTS-minimax
   hybrids that integrate shallow minimax searches into the MCTS framework.
   Three approaches are outlined, using minimax in the selection/expansion
   phase, the rollout phase, and the backpropagation phase of MCTS. Without
   assuming domain knowledge in the form of evaluation functions, these
   hybrid algorithms are a first step towards combining the strategic
   strength of MCTS and the tactical strength of minimax. We investigate
   their effectiveness in the test domains of Connect-4, Breakthrough,
   Othello, and Catch the Lion, and relate this performance to the
   tacticality of the domains.}},

Abstract = {{Fault detection and diagnosis is critical to many applications in order
   to ensure proper operation and performance over time. Positron emission
   tomography (PET) systems that require regular calibrations by qualified
   scanner operators are good candidates for such continuous improvements.
   Furthermore, for scanners employing one-to-one coupling of crystals to
   photodetectors to achieve enhanced spatial resolution and contrast, the
   calibration task is even more daunting because of the large number of
   independent channels involved. To cope with the additional complexity of
   the calibration and quality control procedures of these scanners, an
   intelligent system (IS) was designed to perform fault detection and
   diagnosis (FDD) of malfunctioning channels. The IS can be broken down
   into four hierarchical modules: parameter extraction, diagnosis, channel
   fault detection and fault prioritization. Of these modules, parameter
   extraction and fault detection have previously been reported and this
   paper focuses on diagnosis, improved fault detection and fault
   prioritization. The status diagnosis module will diagnose all channels
   and propose an explanation of the reasons that lead to the diagnosis.
   The purpose of the fault prioritization module is to help the operator
   to zero in on the faults that need immediate attention. The FDD system
   was implemented on a LabPET avalanche photodiode (APD)-based digital PET
   scanner. Experiments demonstrated a FDD Sensitivity of 99.9\% (with a

Abstract = {{A novel hybrid approach for analysis of complex gamma-ray spectra of
   various origins is described and the test results using spectra obtained
   from a sodium iodide detector (NaI) are presented. This novel approach
   exploits the synergism of two artificial intelligence tools; fuzzy logic
   and genetic algorithms, where the two are merged to identify isotopes
   and their respective contribution in a given spectrum. The fuzzy logic
   module focuses on identifying isotopes in the spectrum, while the
   genetic algorithm (GA) fits and subsequently computes the fractional
   abundances of the identified isotopes. The fitting of the spectrum is
   controlled by an assessment procedure based on the test for significance
   of abundance coefficients, and on the computation of Theil coefficients.
   This unique synergism between fuzzy logic and GA presents a novel
   mechanism for automated selection of isotopes for use in spectrum
   fitting, and as a result eliminates manually-based fitting and/or user
   intervention. A variety of test cases-including NaI real measured
   spectra-are used to benchmark this new approach. In addition, the
   performance of the hybrid method is compared to the multiple linear
   regression (MLR) fitting approach, along with the combination of fuzzy
   logic with MLR. This comparison demonstrates a slight superiority of
   this novel approach regarding accuracy, precision and number of reported
   false detections.}},

Abstract = {{Logic-based abduction is an important reasoning method with many
   applications in Artificial Intelligence including diagnosis, planning,
   and configuration. The goal of an abduction problem is to find a
   `solution', i.e., an explanation for some observed symptoms. Usually,
   many solutions exist, and one is often interested in minimal ones only.
   Previous definitions of `solutions' to an abduction problem tacitly made
   an open-world assumption. However, as far as minimality is concerned,
   this assumption may not always lead to the desired behaviour. To
   overcome this problem, we propose a new definition of solutions based on
   a closed-world approach. Moreover, we also introduce a new variant of
   minimality where only a part of the hypotheses is subject to
   minimization. Athorough complexity analysis reveals the close
   relationship between these two new notions as well as the differences
   compared with previous notions of solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Naturally inspired evolutionary algorithms prove effectiveness when used
   for solving feature selection and classification problems. Artificial
   Bee Colony (ABC) is a relatively new swarm intelligence method. In this
   paper, we propose a new hybrid gene selection method, namely Genetic Bee
   Colony (GBC) algorithm. The proposed algorithm combines the used of a
   Genetic Algorithm (GA) along with Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm.
   The goal is to integrate the advantages of both algorithms. The proposed
   algorithm is applied to a microarray gene expression profile in order to
   select the most predictive and informative genes for cancer
   classification. In order to test the accuracy performance of the
   proposed algorithm, extensive experiments were conducted. Three binary
   microarray datasets are use, which include: colon, leukemia, and lung.
   In addition, another three multi-class microarray datasets are used,
   which are: SRBCT, lymphoma, and leukemia. Results of the GBC algorithm
   are compared with our recently proposed technique: mRMR when combined
   with the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (mRMR-ABC). We also compared
   the combination of mRMR with GA (mRMR-GA) and Particle Swarm
   Optimization (mRMR-PSO) algorithms. In addition, we compared the GBC
   algorithm with other related algorithms that have been recently
   published in the literature, using all benchmark datasets. The GBC
   algorithm shows superior performance as it achieved the highest
   classification accuracy along with the lowest average number of selected
   genes. This proves that the GBC algorithm is a promising approach for
   solving the gene selection problem in both binary and multi-class cancer
   classification. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   sources with ontological mapping}},
Journal = {{DIGITAL INVESTIGATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{94-106}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The sharp rise in consumer computing, electronic and mobile devices and
   data volumes has resulted in increased workloads for digital forensic
   investigators and analysts. The number of crimes involving electronic
   devices is increasing, as is the amount of data for each job. This is
   becoming unscaleable and alternate methods to reduce the time trained
   analysts spend on each job are necessary.
   This work leverages standardised knowledge representations techniques
   and automated rule-based systems to encapsulate expert knowledge for
   forensic data. The implementation of this research can provide
   high-level analysis based on low-level digital artefacts in a way that
   allows an understanding of what decisions support the facts. Analysts
   can quickly make determinations as to which artefacts warrant further
   investigation and create high level case data without manually creating
   it from the low-level artefacts. Extraction and understanding of users
   and social networks and translating the state of file systems to
   sequences of events are the first uses for this work.
   A major goal of this work is to automatically derive `events' from the
   base forensic artefacts. Events may be system events, representing
   logins, start-ups, shutdowns, or user events, such as web browsing,
   sending email. The same information fusion and homogenisation techniques
   are used to reconstruct social networks. There can be numerous social
   network data sources on a single computer; internet cache can locate
   Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Plus caches; email has address books and
   copies of emails sent and received; instant messenger has friend lists
   and call histories. Fusing these into a single graph allows a more
   complete, less fractured view for an investigator.
   Both event creation and social network creation are expected to assist
   investigator-led triage and other fast forensic analysis situations. (C)

Abstract = {{Understanding the underlying differences between groups or classes in

   proposed technique is rules for contrast sets, which seeks to express
   each contrast set found in terms of rules. This work extends rules for
   contrast sets to a temporal data mining task. We define a set of
   temporal patterns in order to capture the significant changes in the
   contrasts discovered along the considered time line. To evaluate the
   proposal accuracy and ability to discover relevant information, two

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{465-476}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Several real world prediction problems involve forecasting rare values
   of a target variable. When this variable is nominal, we have a problem
   of class imbalance that was thoroughly studied within machine learning.
   For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, few works
   exist addressing this type of problem. Still, important applications
   involve forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable.
   This paper describes a contribution to this type of tasks. Namely, we
   propose to address such tasks by resampling approaches that change the
   distribution of the given data set to decrease the problem of imbalance
   between the rare target cases and the most frequent ones. We present two
   modifications of well-known resampling strategies for classification
   tasks: the under-sampling and the synthetic minority over-sampling
   technique (SMOTE) methods. These modifications allow the use of these
   strategies on regression tasks where the goal is to forecast rare
   extreme values of the target variable. In an extensive set of
   experiments, we provide empirical evidence for the superiority of our
   proposals for these particular regression tasks. The proposed resampling
   methods can be used with any existing regression algorithm, which means
   that they are general tools for addressing problems of forecasting rare
   extreme values of a continuous target variable.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{There are many factors which affect the performance of a complex
   production system. Efficiency of an assembly line is one of the most
   important of these factors since assembly lines are generally
   constructed as the last stage of an entire production system. Parallel
   two-sided assembly line system is a new research domain in academia
   though these lines have been utilised to produce large sized products
   such as automobiles, trucks, and buses in industry for many years.
   Parallel two-sided assembly lines carry practical advantages of both
   parallel assembly lines and two-sided assembly lines.
   The main purpose of this paper is to introduce type-E parallel two-sided
   assembly line balancing probleni for the first time in the literature
   and to propose a new ant colony optimisation based approach for solving
   the problem. Different from the existing studies on parallel assembly
   line balancing problems in the literature, this paper aims to minimise
   two conflicting objectives, namely cycle time and number of
   work-stations at the same time and proposes a mathematical model for the
   formal description of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is
   the first study which addresses both conflicting objectives on a
   parallel two-sided assembly line configuration. The developed ant colony
   optimisation algorithm is illustrated with an example to explain its
   procedures. An experimental design is also conducted to calibrate the
   parameters of the proposed algorithm using response surface methodology.
   Results obtained from the performed computational study indicate that
   minimising cycle time as well as number of workstations help increase
   system efficiency. It is also observed that the proposed algorithm finds
   promising results for the studied cases of type-E parallel two-sided
   assembly line balancing problem when the results are compared with those
   obtained from other three well-known heuristics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   manner is exploited for mathematical modeling of the equation; training
   of weights is carried out with an efficient constrained optimization
   technique based on the SQP algorithm. The proposed scheme is evaluated
   on two initial value problems of the Riccati fractional order equation
   with integer and non-integer derivatives. Comparison of results with the
   exact solution, and with reference numerical methods demonstrates the
   correctness of the proposed methodology. Performance of the proposed
   scheme is also validated using results of statistical analysis based on
   a sufficiently large number of independent runs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{By integrating information we mean pulling information pieces from
   various sources together with as little loss of information and as
   little redundancy as possible. Operation Research techniques applied in
   many situations, like heuristic algorithms, meta-heuristics, similarity
   measures, use of constraints, combinatorial algorithms and collaborative
   efforts provide valuable tools for this process, if augmented by other
   techniques known from knowledge management and information retrieval.
   Given the huge amount of information we are confronted with, information
   integration is one of the biggest challenges of this century. This paper
   describes methods and techniques for the information integration
   process. It is interesting to note that in areas such as information
   integration, consolidation and simplification that are not usually at
   the heart of Operation Research, some of the most important techniques
   used in this field can be applied successfully. Information integration
   is an important topic but, in general no really convincing approaches
   have been discovered, so far. By limiting the domain to the integration
   of image databases the problem becomes tractable, by using the mentioned
   techniques and also applying methods ranging from image processing,
   knowledge management and natural language processing to feature
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Emotions have been subject of research and deliberation in philosophy
   and psychology mainstream for a long time. In contrast, emotions have
   only emerged in artificial intelligence research as a serious topic in
   the last two decades. Year 2000, in particular, experienced a shift in
   attitude towards emotions and their relationship to human reasoning and
   human-computer interaction. This shift continued slowly but surely over
   the years and computational emotions can be seen as a mainstream
   research topic within artificial intelligence and cognitive systems. In
   this paper, we attempt to contribute to the development of this area by
   interpreting psychological theories of emotions computationally and
   translating them into machine implementable models. These models are
   generic and application independent which most of the current
   computational emotions models lack. We have selected two psychological
   theories, namely Millenson (The psychology of emotion: theories of
   emotion perspective, vol 4. Wiley, New Jersey, pp 35-36, 1967) and
   Scherer (Soc Sci Inf 44(4):695-729, 2005), that lend themselves, with
   varying degrees of difficulty, to the computational interpretation.
   Fuzzy logic was utilised as a tool to keep the fidelity of psychological
   interpretation of emotion. The paper discusses in details the
   computational interpretation of these psychological models and presents
   a full theoretical formalism in fuzzy logic type 1, implementation and
   detailed analysis of this psychologically grounded generic computational
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Bayesian Networks are increasingly popular methods of modeling
   uncertainty in artificial intelligence and machine learning. A Bayesian
   Network consists of a directed acyclic graph in which each node
   represents a variable and each arc represents probabilistic dependency
   between two variables. Constructing a Bayesian Network from data is a
   learning process that consists of two steps: learning structure and
   learning parameter. Learning a network structure from data is the most
   difficult task in this process. This paper presents a new algorithm for
   constructing an optimal structure for Bayesian Networks based on
   optimization. The algorithm has two major parts. First, we define an
   optimization model to find the better network graphs. Then, we apply an
   optimization approach for removing possible cycles from the directed
   graphs obtained in the first part which is the first of its kind in the
   literature. The main advantage of the proposed method is that the
   maximal number of parents for variables is not fixed a priory and it is
   defined during the optimization procedure. It also considers all
   networks including cyclic ones and then choose a best structure by
   applying a global optimization method. To show the efficiency of the
   algorithm, several closely related algorithms including unrestricted
   dependency Bayesian Network algorithm, as well as, benchmarks algorithms
   SVM and C4.5 are employed for comparison. We apply these algorithms on
   data classification; data sets are taken from the UCI machine learning
   repository and the LIBSVM.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering is an unsupervised classification method in the field of data
   mining. Many population based evolutionary and swarm intelligence
   optimization methods are proposed to optimize clustering solutions
   globally based on a single selected objective function which lead to
   produce a single best solution. In this sense, optimized solution is
   biased towards a single objective, hence it is not equally well to the
   data set having clusters of different geometrical properties. Thus,
   clustering having multiple objectives should be naturally optimized
   through multiobjective optimization methods for capturing different
   properties of the data set. To achieve this clustering goal, many
   multiobjective population based optimization methods, e.g.,
   multiobjective genetic algorithm, mutiobjective particle swarm
   optimization (MOPSO), are proposed to obtain diverse tradeoff solutions
   in the pareto-front. As single directional diversity mechanism in
   particle swarm optimization converges prematurely to local optima, this
   paper presents a two-stage diversity mechanism in MOPSO to improve its
   exploratory capabilities by incorporating crossover operator of the
   genetic algorithm. External archive is used to store non-dominated
   solutions, which is further utilized to find one best solution having
   highest F-measure value at the end of the run. Two conceptually
   orthogonal internal measures SSE and connectedness are used to estimate
   the clustering quality. Results demonstrate effectiveness of the
   proposed method over its competitors MOPSO, non-dominated sorting
   genetic algorithm, and multiobjective artificial bee colony on seven
   real data sets from UCI machine learning repository.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the productivity of machine tools has been
   significantly improved by using computer-based CAD/CAM systems for
   Computer Numerical Control (CNC). Various types of CAM software in the
   market that provide tool path programming and can be applied for
   different types of the machining process such as drilling, milling, and
   turning. However, sometimes the default tool path generated in the
   CAD/CAM system is not the optimal tool path which produces longer
   distance and increase the machining time. In this paper, we present
   cutting tools movement by Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony
   Optimization (ACO) method in generation of shortest tool path. For
   observation of the performance of both methods, comparisons with
   conventional method have been carried out. The shortest path of drilling
   tool path adapts Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) in determining the
   distance during machining. The simulation result shows that ACO and GA
   based tool path optimization is useful to find a lower distance of tool
   path generation for holes drilling process.}},

Abstract = {{Boosting is an iterative process that improves the predictive accuracy
   for supervised (machine) learning algorithms. Boosting operates by
   learning multiple functions with subsequent functions focusing on
   incorrect instances where the previous functions predicted the wrong
   label. Despite considerable success, boosting still has difficulty on
   data sets with certain types of problematic training data (e.g., label
   noise) and when complex functions overfit the training data. We propose
   a novel cluster-based boosting (CBB) approach to address limitations in
   boosting for supervised learning systems. Our CBB approach partitions
   the training data into clusters containing highly similar member data
   and integrates these clusters directly into the boosting process. CBB
   boosts selectively (using a high learning rate, low learning rate, or
   not boosting) on each cluster based on both the additional structure
   provided by the cluster and previous function accuracy on the member
   data. Selective boosting allows CBB to improve predictive accuracy on
   problematic training data. In addition, boosting separately on clusters
   reduces function complexity to mitigate overfitting. We provide
   comprehensive experimental results on 20 UCI benchmark data sets with
   three different kinds of supervised learning systems. These results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our CBB approach compared to a popular
   boosting algorithm, an algorithm that uses clusters to improve boosting,
   and two algorithms that use selective boosting without clustering.}},

Title = {{Fuzzy entropy based optimal thresholding using bat algorithm}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{381-395}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Image segmentation is a very significant process in image analysis. Much
   effort based on thresholding has been made on this field as it is simple
   and intuitive, commonly used thresholding approaches are to optimize a
   criterion such as between-class variance or entropy for seeking
   appropriate threshold values. However, a mass of computational cost is
   needed and efficiency is broken down as an exhaustive search is utilized
   for finding the optimal thresholds, which results in application of
   evolutionary algorithm and swarm intelligence to obtain the optimal
   thresholds. This paper considers image thresholding as a constrained
   optimization problem and optimal thresholds for 1-level or multi-level
   thresholding in an image are acquired by maximizing the fuzzy entropy
   via a newly proposed bat algorithm. The optimal thresholding is achieved
   through the convergence of bat algorithm. The proposed method has been
   tested on some natural and infrared images. The results are compared
   with the fuzzy entropy based methods that are optimized by artificial
   bee colony algorithm (ABC), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO); moreover, they are
   also compared with thresholding methods based on criteria of
   between-class variance and Kapur's entropy optimized by bat algorithm.
   It is demonstrated that the proposed method is robust, adaptive,
   encouraging on the score of CPU time and exhibits the better performance
   than other methods involved in the paper in terms of objective function
   values. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Automating correctness verification of artifact-centric business process
   models}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{187-197}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Context: The artifact-centric methodology has emerged as a new paradigm
   to support business process management over the last few years. This
   way, business processes are described from the point of view of the
   artifacts that are manipulated during the process.
   Objective: One of the research challenges in this area is the
   verification of the correctness of this kind of business process models
   where the model is formed of various artifacts that interact among them.
   Method: In this paper, we propose a fully automated approach for
   verifying correctness of artifact-centric business process models,
   taking into account that the state (lifecycle) and the values of each
   artifact (numerical data described by pre and postconditions) influence
   in the values and the state of the others. The lifecycles of the
   artifacts and the numerical data managed are modeled by using the
   Constraint Programming paradigm, an Artificial Intelligence technique.
   Results: Two correctness notions for artifact-centric business process
   models are distinguished (reachability and weak termination), and novel
   verification algorithms are developed to check them. The algorithms are
   complete: neither false positives nor false negatives are generated.
   Moreover, the algorithms offer precise diagnosis of the detected errors,
   indicating the execution causing the error where the lifecycle gets
   stuck.
   Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first
   verification approach for artifact-centric business process models that
   integrates pre and postconditions, which define the behavior of the
   services, and numerical data verification when the model is formed of
   more than one artifact. The approach can detect errors not detectable
   with other approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the fact that electric vehicles have not broadly entered the
   vehicle market there are many attempts to convince producers to
   integrate technologies that utilise embedded batteries for purposes
   different from driving. The vehicle-to-grid technology, for instance,
   literally turns electric vehicles into a mobile battery, enabling new
   areas of applications (e.g., to provide regulatory energy, to do
   grid-load balancing, or to buffer surpluses of energy) and business
   perspectives. Utilising a vehicle's battery, however is not without a
   price-in this case: the driver's mobility. Given this dependency, it is
   interesting that most available works consider the application of
   electric vehicles for energy and grid-related problems in isolation,
   that is, detached from mobility-related issues. The distributed
   artificial intelligence laboratory, or DAI-Lab, is a third-party funded
   research lab at Technische Universitat Berlin and integrates the chair
   for agent technologies in business applications and telecommunication.
   The DAI-Lab has engaged in a large number of both, past and upcoming
   projects concerned with two aspects of managing electric vehicles,
   namely: energy and mobility. This article aims to summarise experiences
   that were collected during the last years and to present developed
   solutions which consider energy and mobility-related problems jointly.}},

Abstract = {{Many future decision support systems will be human-centric, i.e.,
   require substantial human oversight and control. Because these systems
   often provide critical services, high assurance is needed that they
   satisfy their requirements. This paper, the product of an
   interdisciplinary research team of experts in formal methods, adaptive
   agents, and cognitive science, addresses this problem by proposing a new
   process for developing high assurance human-centric decision systems.
   This process uses AI (artificial intelligence) methods-i.e., a cognitive
   model to predict human behavior and an adaptive agent to assist the
   human-to improve system performance, and software engineering
   methods-i.e., formal modeling and analysis-to obtain high assurance that
   the system behaves as intended. The paper describes a new method for
   synthesizing a formal system model from Event Sequence Charts, a variant
   of Message Sequence Charts, and a Mode Diagram, a specification of
   system modes and mode transitions. It also presents results of a new
   pilot study investigating the optimal level of agent assistance for
   different users in which the agent design was evaluated using
   synthesized user models. Finally, it reviews a cognitive model for
   predicting human overload in complex human-centric systems. To
   illustrate the development process and our new techniques, we describe a
   human-centric decision system for controlling unmanned vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a real time testing approach of an Intelligent
   Multiobjective Nonlinear-Model Predictive Control Strategy (iMO-NMPC).
   The goal is the testing and analysis of the feasibility and reliability
   of some Soft Computing (SC) techniques running on a real time industrial
   controller. In this predictive control strategy, a Multiobjective
   Genetic Algorithm is used together with a Recurrent Artificial Neural
   Network in order to obtain the control action at each sampling time. The
   entire development process, from the numeric simulation of the control
   scheme to its implementation and testing on a PC-based industrial
   controller, is also presented in this paper. The computational time
   requirements are discussed as well. The obtained results show that the
   SC techniques can be considered also to tackle highly nonlinear and
   coupled complex control problems in real time, thus optimising and
   enhancing the response of the control loop. Therefore this work is a
   contribution to spread the SC techniques in on-line control
   applications, where currently they are relegated mainly to be used
   off-line, as is the case of optimal tuning of control strategies. (C)

Abstract = {{As an important function of a distributed decision support system, model
   composition aims to aggregate model functions to solve complex decision
   problems. Most existing methods on model composition only apply to the
   models which have the same type of input and output data so that they
   can be linked together directly. Those methods are inadequate for the
   heterogeneous models, since a heterogeneous model may have different
   types of input and output data that are represented in either
   qualitative or quantitative manner. This paper aims to address the
   problem of heterogeneous model composition by employing the techniques
   based on semantic web services and artificial intelligence planning. In
   this paper, the heterogeneous model composition problem is converted to
   the problem of planning in nondeterministic domains under partial
   observability. An automatic composition method is presented to generate
   the composite model based on the planning as model checking technique.
   The experiment results are also presented in this paper to show the
   feasibility and capability of our approach in dealing with the complex

Abstract = {{The effort described in this paper attempts to integrate agility aspects
   in the ``Agility Performance of Robotic Systems{''} (APRS) project,
   developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
   The new technical idea for the APRS project is to develop the
   measurement science in the form of an integrated agility framework
   enabling manufacturers to assess and assure the agility performance of
   their robot systems. This framework includes robot agility performance
   metrics, information models, test methods, and protocols. This paper
   presents models for the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), used
   within the APRS project. PDDL is an attempt to standardize Artificial
   Intelligence planning languages. The described models have been fully
   defined in the XML Schema Definition Language (XSDL) and in the Web
   Ontology Language (OWL) for kit building applications. Kit building or
   kitting is a process that brings parts that will be used in assembly
   operations together in a kit and then moves the kit to the area where
   the parts are used in the final assembly. Furthermore, the paper
   discusses a tool that is capable of automatically and dynamically
   generating PDDL files from the models in order to generate a plan or to
   replan from scratch. Finally, the ability of the tool to update a PDDL
   problem file from a relational database for replanning to recover from
   failures is presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic economic load dispatch (DELD) is one of the most important steps
   in power system operation. Various optimisation algorithms for solving
   the problem have been developed; however, due to the non-convex
   characteristics and large dimensionality of the problem, it is necessary
   to explore new methods to further improve the dispatch results and
   minimise the costs. This article proposes a hybrid differential
   evolution (DE) algorithm, namely clonal selection-based differential
   evolution (CSDE), to solve the problem. CSDE is an artificial
   intelligence technique that can be applied to complex optimisation
   problems which are for example nonlinear, large scale, non-convex and
   discontinuous. This hybrid algorithm combines the clonal selection
   algorithm (CSA) as the local search technique to update the best
   individual in the population, which enhances the diversity of the
   solutions and prevents premature convergence in DE. Furthermore, we
   investigate four mutation operations which are used in CSA as the
   hyper-mutation operations. Finally, an efficient solution repair method
   is designed for DELD to satisfy the complicated equality and inequality
   constraints of the power system to guarantee the feasibility of the
   solutions. Two benchmark power systems are used to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that
   the proposed CSDE/best/1 approach significantly outperforms nine other
   variants of CSDE and DE, as well as most other published methods, in
   terms of the quality of the solution and the convergence
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{As a newly emerged swarm intelligence-based optimizer, the artificial

   new solution. The performance of the BABC algorithm is investigated and
   compared with that of the basic ABC, modified ABC, Brest's differential
   evolution, self-adaptive differential evolution and restart covariance
   matrix adaptation evolution strategy (IPOP-CMA-ES) over a set of widely
   used benchmark functions. The obtained results show that the performance

Abstract = {{This paper describes a scheme to improve efficiency of multi-agent
   simulation system (MAS) on single computer that has multiple processor
   cores. Simulation technology is applied for broad usage in the world,
   and MAS gathers attention from the fields that treat complicated and
   non-numeric issues such as traffic analysis, analyzing evacuation from a
   building, and defense training. Since the requirements of simulation
   scale and fidelity are growing, the importance of their performance is
   also increasing. However, CPU clock speedup is slowing, and improvement
   of computer performance has come to depend on the number of processors,
   cores, and graphics processing units. Consequently, load distribution
   and balancing are the keys to deriving better performance, and we
   consider there is a brilliant move to improve efficiency by utilizing
   MAS's peculiar attributes. We have developed a multi-agent system
   framework called Furuichi-lab Unified Simulation Environment (FUSE) that
   enables easy building of MAS systems and can control thousands of agents
   with human-like artificial intelligence in real time on standard
   personal computers. Since agents are heterogeneous and their cluster
   size can vary, including in our MAS application, we have based our
   load-balancing method on estimating each agent's workload.
   Load-balancing must be the basic function of the framework, and the
   load-balancing method must be available implicitly without any intention
   on the part of simulation developers. Therefore, the workload estimation
   process must be independent of the application. We propose an efficient
   load-balancing scheme for MAS that utilizes the history of agents'
   workload records. In this paper, we describe the algorithm of our
   proposed scheme, show an overview of preliminary experiments using a
   prototype core system, and then explain the results and discuss the
   effectiveness of this scheme by applying it to a practical simulation
   program.}},

Abstract = {{Economic value additions to knowledge and demand provide practical,
   embedded and extensible meaning to philosophizing cognitive systems.
   Evaluation of a cognitive system is an empirical matter. Thinking of
   science in terms of distributed cognition (interactionism) enlarges the
   domain of cognition. Anything that actually contributes to the specific
   quality of output of a cognitive system is part of the system in time
   and/or space. Cognitive science studies behaviour and knowledge
   structures of experts and categorized structures based on underlying
   structures. Knowledge representation through understanding of `epistemic
   cultures' is an evolutionary stage. But cognition goes beyond knowledge
   representation. Notwithstanding the importance of epistemology of
   phenomena, the practicability cum philosophical aspects of machine
   learning needs to be seen in dynamic behaviour in
   socio-economic-technical value additions if human machine interaction
   processes that are context specific are incorporated into strong
   artificial intelligent systems. Cognitive Science is also studied from
   both computational and biological angles. Evolution of interactive forms
   of reasoning through understanding of meta-language of computations or
   biological learning processes is possible. But the limitation of
   historical cultures predefines the role of interactive processes in
   user-networks beyond technology networks. Despite this limitation,
   inclusive development notions of a heterogeneous national society such
   as India or Europe can be tested and incorporated.}},

   difficult to solve using basic genetic algorithm designs that utilize a

Abstract = {{Cloud contamination is a big obstacle when processing satellite images
   retrieved from visible and infrared spectral ranges for application.
   Although computational techniques including interpolation and
   substitution have been applied to recover missing information caused by
   cloud contamination, these algorithms are subject to many limitations.
   In this paper, a novel smart information reconstruction (SMIR) method is
   proposed, in order to reconstruct cloud contaminated pixel values from
   the time-space-spectrum continuum with the aid of a machine learning
   tool, namely extreme learning machine (ELM). For the purpose of
   demonstration, the performance of SMIR is evaluated by reconstructing
   the missing remote sensing reflectance values derived from the Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra
   satellite over Lake Nicaragua, where is a very cloudy area year round.
   For comparison, the traditional backpropagation neural network
   algorithms will also be implemented to reconstruct the missing values.
   Experimental results show that the ELM outperforms the BP algorithms by
   an enhanced machine learning capacity with simulated memory effect
   embedded in MODIS due to linking the complex time-space-spectrum
   continuum between cloud-free and cloudy pixels. The ELM-based SMIR
   practice presents a correlation coefficient of 0.88 with root mean
   squared error of 7.4E - 04sr(-1) between simulated and observed
   reflectance values. Finding suggests that the SMIR method is effective
   to reconstruct all the missing information providing visually logical
   and quantitatively assured images for further image processing and
   interpretation in environmental applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an advanced insulin bolus advisor for people with
   diabetes on multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy. The
   proposed system, which runs on a smartphone, keeps the simplicity of a
   standard bolus calculator while enhancing its performance by providing
   more adaptability and flexibility. This is achieved by means of applying
   a retrospective optimization of the insulin bolus therapy using a novel
   combination of run-to-run (R2R) that uses intermittent continuous
   glucose monitoring data, and case-based reasoning (CBR). The validity of
   the proposed approach has been proven by in-silico studies using the
   FDA-accepted UVa-Padova type 1 diabetes simulator. Tests under more
   realistic in-silico scenarios are achieved by updating the simulator to
   emulate intrasubject insulin sensitivity variations and uncertainty in
   the capillarity measurements and carbohydrate intake. The CBR(R2R)
   algorithm performed well in simulations by significantly reducing the
   mean blood glucose, increasing the time in euglycemia and completely
   eliminating hypoglycaemia. Finally, compared to an R2R stand-alone
   version of the algorithm, the CBR(R2R) algorithm performed better in
   both adults and adolescent populations, proving the benefit of the
   utilization of CBR. In particular, the mean blood glucose improved from
   166 +/- 39 to 150 +/- 16 in the adult populations (p = 0.03) and from
   167 +/- 25 to 162 +/- 23 in the adolescent population (p = 0.06). In
   addition, CBR(R2R) was able to completely eliminate hypoglycaemia, while
   the R2R alone was not able to do it in the adolescent population.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing offers a compelling vision of computation, enabling an
   unprecedented level of data distribution and sharing. Beyond improving
   the computing infrastructure, cloud computing enables a higher level of
   interoperability between information systems, simplifying tasks such as
   sharing documents between coworkers or enabling collaboration between an
   organization and its suppliers. While these abilities may result in
   significant benefits to users and organizations, they also present
   privacy challenges due to unwanted exposure of sensitive information. As
   information-sharing processes in cloud computing are complex and domain
   specific, configuring these processes can be an overwhelming and
   burdensome task for users. This article investigates the feasibility of
   configuring sharing processes through a small and representative set of
   canonical configuration options. For this purpose, we present a generic
   method, named SCON-UP (Simplified CON-figuration of User Preferences).
   SCON-UP simplifies configuration interfaces by using a clustering
   algorithm that analyzes a massive set of sharing preferences and
   condenses them into a small number of discrete disclosure levels. Thus,
   the user is provided with a usable configuration model while
   guaranteeing adequate privacy control. We describe the algorithm and
   empirically evaluate our model using data collected in two user studies
   (n = 121 and n = 352). Our results show that when provided with three
   canonical configuration options, on average, 82\% of the population can
   be covered by at least one option. We exemplify the feasibility of
   discretizing sharing levels and discuss the tradeoff between coverage
   and simplicity in discrete configuration options.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate electric load forecasting could prove to be a very useful tool
   for all market participants in electricity markets. Because it can not
   only help power producers and consumers make their plans but also can
   maximize their profits. In this paper, a new combined forecasting method
   (ESPLSSVM) based on empirical mode decomposition, seasonal adjustment,
   particle swarm optimization (PSO) and least squares support vector
   machine (LSSVM) model is proposed. In the electric market, noise signals
   usually affect the forecasting accuracy, which were caused by different
   erratic factors. First of all, ESPLSSVM uses an empirical mode
   decomposition-based signal filtering method to reduce the influence of
   noise signals. Secondly, ESPLSSVM eliminates the seasonal components
   from the de-noised resulting series and then it models the resultant
   series using the LSSVM which is optimized by PSO (PLSSVM). Finally, by
   multiplying the seasonal indexes by the PLSSVM forecasts, ESPLSSVM
   acquires the final forecasting result. The effectiveness of the
   presented method is examined by comparing with different methods
   including basic LSSVM (LSSVM), empirical mode decomposition-based signal
   filtering method processed by LSSVM (ELSSVM) and seasonal adjustment
   processed by LSSVM (SLSSVM). Case studies show ESPLSSVM performed better
   than the other three load forecasting approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{This paper presents new design methodology and performance comparison of
   two hybrid fault-tolerant control (FTC) schemes applied to the
   regulation of the frequency and voltage amplitude of a diesel engine
   generator installed in a microgrid. Both of them are based on a unique
   combination of a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) with a
   proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and artificial
   intelligence techniques, i.e. artificial neural networks (ANN) and
   genetic algorithms (GA). Since in an islanded microgrid, the frequency
   of the system is determined by the shaft speed of the diesel engine
   (DE), while the voltage amplitude is set by the synchronous generator
   (SG) field voltage, therefore, two FTC systems for frequency and voltage
   regulation have been implemented in each proposed control scheme. The
   first scheme consists of an MRAC system with a PID controller tuned by a
   GA for controlling the speed of the DE and a classic MRAC system for
   controlling the voltage amplitude of the SG. In the second scheme, an
   MRAC system with a GA-tuned PID controller is used for the DE, and a
   hybrid controller in which the MRAC is combined with an ANN and a PID
   controller tuned by a GA is designed for the SG. The dynamic models of
   the microgrid components are presented in detail, and the proposed
   microgrid and its FTC systems are implemented and tested in the Simpower
   Systems of MATLAB/Simulink (R) simulation environment. All results
   indicate high effectiveness and robustness of the MRAC-based FTC schemes
   in both normal and emergency/faulty operations of the microgrid in
   comparison with a benchmark baseline controller, IEEE Type 1 AVR for the
   SG and a PID controlled governor for the DE. Copyright (c) 2014 John

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Mining object-level knowledge, that is, building a comprehensive
   category model base, from a large set of cluttered scenes presents a
   considerable challenge to the field of artificial intelligence. How to
   initiate model learning with the least human supervision (i.e., manual
   labeling) and how to encode the structural knowledge are two elements of
   this challenge, as they largely determine the scalability and
   applicability of any solution. In this article, we propose a
   model-learning method that starts from a single-labeled object for each
   category, and mines further model knowledge from a number of informally
   captured, cluttered scenes. However, in these scenes, target objects are
   relatively small and have large variations in texture, scale, and
   rotation. Thus, to reduce the model bias normally associated with less
   supervised learning methods, we use the robust 3D shape in RGB-D images
   to guide our model learning, then apply the properly trained category
   models to both object detection and recognition in more conventional RGB
   images. In addition to model training for their own categories, the
   knowledge extracted from the RGB-D images can also be transferred to
   guide model learning for a new category, in which only RGB images
   without depth information in the new category are provided for training.
   Preliminary testing shows that the proposed method performs as well as
   fully supervised learning methods.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term hydrothermal scheduling (STHTS) is a non-linear and complex
   optimization problem with a set of operational hydraulic and thermal
   constraints. Earlier, this problem has been addressed by several
   classical techniques; however, due to limitations such as non-linearity
   and non-convexity in cost curves, artificial intelligence tools based
   techniques are being used to solve the STHTS problem. In this paper an
   improved chaotic hybrid differential evolution (ICHDE) algorithm is
   proposed to find an optimal solution to this problem taking into account
   practical constraints. A self-adjusted parameter setting is obtained in
   differential evolution (DE) with the application of chaos theory, and a
   chaotic hybridized local search mechanism is embedded in DE to
   effectively prevent it from premature convergence. Furthermore,
   heuristic constraint handling techniques without any penalty factor
   setting are adopted to handle the complex hydraulic and thermal
   constraints. The superiority and effectiveness of the developed
   methodology are evaluated by its application in two illustrated
   hydrothermal test systems taken from the literature. The transmission
   line losses, prohibited discharge zones of hydel plants, and ramp rate
   limits of thermal plants are also taken into account. The simulation
   results reveal that the proposed technique is competent to produce an
   encouraging solution as compared with other recently established
   evolutionary approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to validate an artificial wavelet neural
   network, or wavenet model, combined with artificial bee colony
   optimization, a swarm intelligence paradigm, to model powertrain
   components of a truck engine. The arrangement of artificial neural
   networks with wavelet based functions, called artificial wavelet neural
   network or wavenet (AWNN), creates a valuable tool to represent the
   nonlinear multivariable systems. AWNN can be considered a particular
   case of the feed-forward basis function neural network model. To
   illustrate the use of the proposed AWNN based on ABC optimization for
   the black-box modeling, we apply it to model a truck engine with a cubic
   displacement greater than seven liters. Identification results were
   carried out using AWNN implemented in Matlab computational environment
   and the model accuracy is evaluated based on performance indices. Final
   results were compared with Elman network, Jordan network and kernel
   adaptive filtering in order to check the AWNN performance. The
   comparison methods were tuned with the same optimization algorithm in
   order to find their best tuning parameters. The simulation results show
   that the artificial wavelet neural network approach can be useful and a
   promising technique in powertrain components modeling. This proposed
   AWNN combined with artificial bee colony approach allows modeling the
   dynamical behavior of powertrain components of a truck engine. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFSs), proposed in 1983, are extensions
   of fuzzy sets. Some years after their introduction, sequentially,
   intuitionistic fuzzy propositional logic, intuitionistic fuzzy predicate
   logic, intuitionistic fuzzy modal logic and intuitionistic fuzzy
   temporal logic have been introduced, presented here shortly. During the
   last 25 years, different intuitionistic fuzzy tools have been used for
   evaluation of objects from the area of the Artificial Intelligence, as
   expert systems (having, e.g. facts and rules, with intuitionistic fuzzy
   degrees of validity and non-validity), decision making processes
   (having, e.g. intuitionistic fuzzy estimations of the criteria), neural
   networks, pattern recognitions, metaheuristic algorithms, etc. Short
   review of these legs of research is offered, with some concrete ideas of
   possible new directions of study. On this basis, a non-formal discussion
   is raised on the benefits of applying various elements of intuitionistic
   fuzzy logics as tools for evaluation of Data Mining processes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimal tree (OARSMT) problem
   is a fundamental problem in very large-scale integrated circuit physical
   design and can be reduced to the Steiner tree problem in graphs (GSTP),
   which can be solved by using three types of common methods: classic
   heuristics, local search algorithms, or computational intelligence
   algorithms. However, classic heuristics have poor solution qualities;
   local search algorithms easily fall into the problem of the local
   optimum; and the searching effects of the existing computational
   intelligence algorithms are poor for this problem. In order to improve
   the solution quality, we propose a novel discrete artificial bee colony
   algorithm for constructing an obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner
   tree. We first generate the escape graph for the OARSMT problem. Then,
   we search for a near-optimal solution consisting of some edges of escape
   graph by using the discrete ABC algorithm. We apply a key-node
   neighborhood configuration for the local search strategy and introduce
   two local search operators. We then naturally use a key-node-based
   encoding scheme for representing the feasible solution and obtain a
   tight searching scope. We employ a modified classic heuristic as the
   encoder that can produce a feasible solution. Experiments conducted on
   both general GSTP and very large-scale integrated circuit instances
   reveal the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of the
   solution quality among the state-of-the-art algorithms.}},

Title = {{Moving average reversion strategy for on-line portfolio selection}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{222}},
Pages = {{104-123}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{On-line portfolio selection, a fundamental problem in computational
   finance, has attracted increasing interest from artificial intelligence
   and machine learning communities in recent years. Empirical evidence
   shows that stock's high and low prices are temporary and stock prices
   are likely to follow the mean reversion phenomenon. While existing mean
   reversion strategies are shown to achieve good empirical performance on
   many real datasets, they often make the single-period mean reversion
   assumption, which is not always satisfied, leading to poor performance
   in certain real datasets. To overcome this limitation, this article
   proposes a multiple-period mean reversion, or so-called ``Moving Average
   Reversion{''} (MAR), and a new on-line portfolio selection strategy
   named ``On-Line Moving Average Reversion{''} (OLMAR), which exploits MAR
   via efficient and scalable online machine learning techniques. From our
   empirical results on real markets, we found that OLMAR can overcome the
   drawbacks of existing mean reversion algorithms and achieve
   significantly better results, especially on the datasets where existing
   mean reversion algorithms failed. In addition to its superior empirical
   performance, OLMAR also runs extremely fast, further supporting its
   practical applicability to a wide range of applications. Finally, we
   have made all the datasets and source codes of this work publicly
   available at our, project website: http://OLPS.stevenhoi.org/. (C) 2015

Title = {{HTN planning: Overview, comparison, and beyond}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},

Volume = {{222}},
Pages = {{124-156}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Hierarchies are one of the most common structures used to understand and
   conceptualise the world. Within the field of Artificial Intelligence
   (AI) planning, which deals with the automation of world-relevant
   problems, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is the branch that
   represents and handles hierarchies. In particular, the requirement for
   rich domain knowledge to characterise the world enables HTN planning to
   be very useful, and also to perform well. However, the history of almost
   40 years obfuscates the current understanding of HTN planning in terms
   of accomplishments, planning models, similarities and differences among
   hierarchical planners, and its current and objective image. On top of
   these issues, the ability of hierarchical planning to truly cope with
   the requirements of real-world applications has been often questioned.
   As a remedy, we propose a framework-based approach where we first
   provide a basis for defining different formal models of hierarchical
   planning, and define two models that comprise a large portion of HTN
   planners. Second, we provide a set of concepts that helps in
   interpreting HTN planners from the aspect of their search space. Then,
   we analyse and compare the planners based on a variety of properties
   organised in five segments, namely domain authoring, expressiveness,
   competence, computation and applicability. Furthermore, we select Web
   service composition as a real-world and current application, and
   classify and compare the approaches that employ HTN planning to solve
   the problem of service composition. Finally, we conclude with our
   findings and present directions for future work. In summary, we provide
   a novel and comprehensive viewpoint on a core AI planning technique. (C)

Title = {{Playing with knowledge: A virtual player for ``Who Wants to Be a

Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},

Volume = {{222}},
Pages = {{157-181}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the techniques used to build a virtual player for
   the popular TV game ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?{''}. The player
   must answer a series of multiple-choice questions posed in natural
   language by selecting the correct answer among four different choices.
   The architecture of the virtual player consists of I) a Question
   Answering (QA) module, which leverages Wikipedia and DBpedia datasources
   to retrieve the most relevant passages of text useful to identify the
   correct answer to a question, 2) an Answer Scoring (AS) module, which
   assigns a score to each candidate answer according to different criteria
   based on the passages of text retrieved by the Question Answering
   module, and 3) a Decision Making (DM) module, which chooses the strategy
   for playing the game according to specific rules as well as to the
   scores assigned to the candidate answers.
   We have evaluated both the accuracy of the virtual player to correctly
   answer to questions of the game, and its ability to play real games in
   order to earn money. The experiments have been carried out on questions
   coming from the official Italian and English boardgames. The average
   accuracy of the virtual player for Italian is 79.64\%, which is
   significantly better than the performance of human players, which is
   equal to 51.33\%. The average accuracy of the virtual player for English
   is 76.41\%. The comparison with human players is not carried out for
   English since, playing successfully the game heavily depends on the
   players' knowledge about popular culture, and in this experiment we have
   only involved a sample of Italian players. As regards the ability to
   play real games, which involves the definition of a proper strategy for
   the usage of lifelines in order to decide whether to answer to a
   question even in a condition of uncertainty or to retire from the game
   by taking the earned money, the virtual player earns (sic) 114,531 on
   average for Italian, and (sic) 88,878 for English, which exceeds the
   average amount earned by the human players to a greater extent ((sic)
   5926 for Italian). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The accurate estimation of reinforcement tensile loads is crucial for
   the evaluation of the internal stabilities of geosynthetic-reinforced
   soil (GRS) structures. This study developed an evolutionary
   metaheuristic intelligence model for efficiently and accurately
   estimating reinforcement loads. The proposed model improves the
   prediction capability of the firefly algorithm (FA) by integrating
   intelligent components, namely, a chaotic map, an adaptive inertia
   weight, and a Levy flight. The enhanced FA is then used to optimise the
   hyperparameters for a least squares support vector regression model. The
   proposed model was validated using a database of 15 wall case studies
   (94 data points in total) via a cross-validation algorithm. The method
   was then compared with conventional prediction methods in terms of the
   accuracy for predicting the reinforcement tensile loads of GRS
   structures. The cross-validation results demonstrated that the proposed
   model has a superior accuracy and mean absolute percentage errors lower
   than 10\%. Moreover, a comparison with the baseline models and empirical
   methods indicate that the evolutionary metaheuristic intelligence model
   provides a significant improvement in terms of the root mean square
   errors (by 63.61-92.30\%). This study validates the effectiveness of the
   proposed model for predicting reinforcement tensile loads and its
   feasibility for facilitating early designs of GRS structures. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Imperfection of information is a part of our daily life; however, it is
   usually ignored in learning based on evolutionary approaches. In this
   paper we develop an Imperfect Evolutionary System that provides an
   uncertain and chaotic imperfect environment that presents new challenges
   to its habitants. We then propose an intelligent methodology which is
   capable of learning in such environments. Detecting changes and adapting
   to the new environment is crucial to exploring the search space and
   exploiting any new opportunities that may arise. To deal with these
   uncertain and challenging environments, we propose a novel change
   detection strategy based on a Particle Swarm Optimization system which
   is hybridized with an Artificial Neural Network. This approach maintains
   a balance between exploitation and exploration during the search
   process. A comparison of approaches using different Particle Swarm
   Optimization algorithms show that the ability of our learning approach
   to detect changes and adapt as per the new demands of the environment is
   high. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Proper management of locations of the mobile devices is of great
   importance in this era of wireless communication networks, as the use of
   the mobile devices has grown exponentially. The registration area
   planning (RAP) problem aims to group the wireless network cells into
   contiguous areas called registration areas in order to minimize the cost
   of managing the location of mobile devices. Since the RAP problem is a
   grouping problem, therefore, a grouping-based artificial bee colony
   algorithm coupled with a local search is developed for this problem. An
   artificial bee colony algorithm is a recently developed swarm
   intelligence technique based on the intelligent foraging behavior of
   honey bee swarm. We have compared the proposed approach with the
   state-of-the-art approaches available in the literature. Computational
   results clearly show the superiority of the proposed approach in
   comparison to these approaches in terms of both the solution quality and

Abstract = {{The production of a motion picture is an expensive, risky endeavor.
   During the five-year period from 2008 through 2012, approximately 90
   films were released in the United States with production budgets in
   excess of \$100 million. The majority of these films failed to recoup
   their production costs via gross domestic box office revenues. Existing
   decision support systems for pre-production analysis and green-lighting
   decisions lack sufficient accuracy to meaningfully assist decision
   makers in the film industry.
   Established models focus primarily upon post-release and post-production
   forecasts. These models often rely upon opening weekend data and are
   reasonably accurate but only if data up until the moment of release is
   included. A forecast made immediately prior to the debut of a film,
   however, is of limited value to stakeholders because it can only
   influence late-stage adjustments to advertising or distribution
   strategies and little else.
   In this paper we present the development of a model based upon a dynamic
   artificial neural network (DAN2) for the forecasting of movie revenues
   during the pre-production period. We first demonstrate the effectiveness
   of DAN2 and show that DAN2 improves box-office revenue forecasting
   accuracy by 32.8\% over existing models. Subsequently, we offer an
   alternative modeling strategy by adding production budgets, pre-release
   advertising expenditures, runtime, and seasonality to the predictive
   variables. This alternative model produces excellent forecasting
   accuracy values of 94.1\%. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The logistic sector raises a number of highly challenging problems.
   Probably one of the most important ones is the shipping planning, i.e.
   plan the routes that the shippers have to follow to deliver the goods.
   In this article, we present an artificial intelligence-based solution
   that has been designed to help a logistic company to improve its routes
   planning process. In order to achieve this goal, the solution uses the
   knowledge acquired by the company drivers to propose optimised routes.
   Hence, the proposed solution gathers the experience of the drivers,
   processes it and optimises the delivery process. The solution uses data
   mining to extract knowledge from the company information systems and
   prepares it for analysis with a case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm.
   The CBR obtains critical business intelligence knowledge from the
   drivers experience that is needed by the planner. The design of the
   routes is done by a genetic algorithm that, given the processed
   information, optimises the routes following several objectives, such as
   minimise the distance or time. Experimentation shows that the proposed
   approach is able to find routes that improve, on average, the routes
   made by the human experts.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid increase in advanced persistent threats in the cyber space
   engenders full attention to the use of intrusion detection with emphasis
   on Artificial Intelligence-based intrusion detection systems as a
   mitigation mechanism. The sharp increase in attack surfaces can be
   partially attributed to the fact that Internet becomes the de facto
   means of converged communications and online transactions accommodating
   different types of services under the same scheme. Most current
   intrusion detection systems (IDS) deploy signature patterns of known
   attacks and anomaly detection approaches in detecting intrusions in an
   attempt to reduce the computational complexity introduced by large scale
   data sets. However, these approaches have been proved to be inadequate
   to detect novel attacks often resulting in a high false positive rate.
   This research will therefore seek to address the issue of detecting
   persistent network threats by combining the approaches of misuse and
   anomaly detection in one system. Our algorithm incorporates the concept
   of active response against all four broad attack types analyzed in the
   literature to realize another algorithm for intrusion detection and
   prevention as well as active response called HYBRITQ-4. The algorithm
   introduces a mechanism for classifying packets based on protocol
   information to enhance pattern searches and matching when detecting
   abnormal packets. Findings from our investigation suggest that the
   proposed algorithm can efficiently improve the detection rate, false
   positive rate and accuracy of detecting intrusions in patterns of known
   and novel attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Runtime verification (RV) consists in part of checking execution traces
   against user-provided formalized specifications. Throughout the last
   decade many new systems have emerged, most of which support
   specification notations based on state machines, regular expressions,
   temporal logic, or grammars. The field of artificial intelligence (AI)
   has for an even longer period of time studied rule-based production
   systems, which at a closer look appear to be relevant for RV, although
   seemingly focused on slightly different application domains, such as,
   for example, business processes and expert systems. The core algorithm
   in many of these systems is the Rete algorithm. We have implemented a
   rule-based system, named LOGFIRE, for runtime verification, founded on
   the Rete algorithm, as an internal DSL in the Scala programming language
   (in essence a library). Using Scala's support for defining DSLs allows
   to write rules elegantly as part of Scala programs. This combination
   appears attractive from a practical point of view. Our contribution is
   part conceptual in arguing that such rule-based frameworks originating
   from AI are suited for RV. Our contribution is technical by implementing
   an internal rule DSL in Scala; by illustrating how specification
   patterns can easily be encoded that generate rules, and by adapting and
   optimizing the Rete algorithm for RV purposes. An experimental
   evaluation is performed comparing to six other trace analysis systems.
   LogFire is currently being used to process telemetry from the Mars
   Curiosity rover at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.}},

Title = {{Case-based reasoning using electronic health records efficiently
   identifies eligible patients for clinical trials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{E1}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective To develop a cost-effective, case-based reasoning framework
   for clinical research eligibility screening by only reusing the
   electronic health records (EHRs) of minimal enrolled participants to
   represent the target patient for each trial under consideration.
   Materials and Methods The EHR data-specifically diagnosis, medications,
   laboratory results, and clinical notes-of known clinical trial
   participants were aggregated to profile the ``target patient{''} for a
   trial, which was used to discover new eligible patients for that trial.
   The EHR data of unseen patients were matched to this ``target
   patient{''} to determine their relevance to the trial; the higher the
   relevance, the more likely the patient was eligible. Relevance scores
   were a weighted linear combination of cosine similarities computed over
   individual EHR data types. For evaluation, we identified 262
   participants of 13 diversified clinical trials conducted at Columbia
   University as our gold standard. We ran a 2-fold cross validation with
   half of the participants used for training and the other half used for
   testing along with other 30 000 patients selected at random from our
   clinical database. We performed binary classification and ranking
   experiments.
   Results The overall area under the ROC curve for classification was
   0.95, enabling the highlight of eligible patients with good precision.
   Ranking showed satisfactory results especially at the top of the
   recommended list, with each trial having at least one eligible patient
   in the top five positions.
   Conclusions This relevance-based method can potentially be used to
   identify eligible patients for clinical trials by processing patient EHR
   data alone without parsing free-text eligibility criteria, and shows
   promise of efficient ``case-based reasoning{''} modeled only on minimal
   trial participants.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The trend of analyzing big data in artificial intelligence demands
   highly-scalable machine learning algorithms, among which clustering is a
   fundamental and arguably the most widely applied method. To extend the
   applications of regular vector-based clustering algorithms, the Discrete
   Distribution (D2) clustering algorithm has been developed, aiming at
   clustering data represented by bags of weighted vectors which are well
   adopted data signatures in many emerging information retrieval and
   multimedia learning applications. However, the high computational
   complexity of D2-clustering limits its impact in solving massive
   learning problems. Here we present the parallel D2-clustering
   (PD2-clustering) algorithm with substantially improved scalability. We
   developed a hierarchical multipass algorithm structure for parallel
   computing in order to achieve a balance between the individual-node
   computation and the integration process of the algorithm. Experiments
   and extensive comparisons between PD2-clustering and other clustering
   algorithms are conducted on synthetic datasets. The results show that
   the proposed parallel algorithm achieves significant speed-up with minor
   accuracy loss. We apply PD2-clustering to image concept learning. In
   addition, by extending D2-clustering to symbolic data, we apply
   PD2-clustering to protein sequence clustering. For both applications, we
   demonstrate the high competitiveness of our new algorithm in comparison
   with other state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Incremental sheet forming is a flexible process that uses a
   hemispherical tool moved by a CNC machine to form a blank sheet. It is
   adopted in the production of prototypes, small series or customized
   parts since it is characterized by low costs and higher process times
   with respect to traditional forming technologies. One of its main lacks
   is represented by the low geometrical accuracy, therefore solutions for
   errors reduction or compensation are required to improve the process. In
   this paper, an iterative algorithm based on an artificial cognitive
   system is presented and validated on a not axisymmetric part adopting
   different tool paths and materials. The results show that the
   integration of the proposed algorithm with the ISF manufacturing system
   allows to improve its intelligence and to achieve a geometrical

Abstract = {{Dual fuel engines are being used these days to overcome shortage of
   fossil fuels and fulfill stringent exhaust gas emission regulations.
   They have several advantages over conventional diesel engines. In this
   context, this paper makes use of experimental results obtained from a
   dual fuel engine for developing models to predict performance and
   emission parameters. Conventional modelling efforts to understand the
   relationships between the input and the output variables, requires
   thermodynamic analysis which is complex and time consuming. As a result,
   efforts have been made to use artificial intelligence modelling
   techniques like fuzzy logic, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Genetic
   Algorithm (GA), etc. This paper uses a neuro fuzzy modelling technique,
   Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for developing prediction
   models for performance and emission parameter of a dual fuel engine.
   Percentage load, percentage Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Injection
   Timing (IT) have been used as input parameters, whereas output
   parameters include Brake Specific Energy Consumption (BSEC), Brake
   Thermal Efficiency (BTE), Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) and smoke. In
   order to further improve the prediction accuracy of the model, GA has
   been used to optimize ANFIS. GA optimized ANFIS gives higher prediction
   accuracy of more than 90\% for all parameters except for smoke, where
   there is a substantial improvement from 46.67\% to 73.33\%, when
   compared to conventional ANFIS model.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of river flow is one of the main issues in the field of water
   resources management. Because of the complexity of the rainfall-runoff
   process, data-driven methods have gained increased importance. In the
   current study, two newly developed models called Least Square Support
   Vector Regression (LSSVR) and Regression Tree (RT) are used. The LSSVR
   model is based on the constrained optimization method and applies
   structural risk minimization in order to yield a general optimized
   result. Also, in the RT, data movement is based on laws discovered in
   the tree. Both models have been applied to the data in the Kashkan
   watershed. Variables include (a) recorded precipitation values in the
   Kashkan watershed stations, and (b) outlet discharge values of one and
   two previous days. Present discharge is considered as output of the two
   models. Following that, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out on
   the input features and less important features have been diminished, so
   that both models have provided better prediction on the data. The final
   results of both models have been compared. It was found that the LSSVR
   model has better performance. Finally, the results present these models
   as suitable models in river flow forecasting. (C) 2015 Sharif University

Abstract = {{Recently, the use of artificial intelligence based data mining
   techniques for massive medical data classification and diagnosis has
   gained its popularity, whereas the effectiveness and efficiency by
   feature selection is worthy to further investigate. In this paper, we
   presents a novel method for feature selection with the use of opposite
   sign test (OST) as a local search for the electromagnetism-like
   mechanism (EM) algorithm, denoted as improved electromagnetism-like
   mechanism (IEM) algorithm. Nearest neighbor algorithm is served as a
   classifier for the wrapper method. The proposed IEM algorithm is
   compared with nine popular feature selection and classification methods.
   Forty-six datasets from the UCI repository and eight gene expression
   microarray datasets are collected for comprehensive evaluation.
   Non-parametric statistical tests are conducted to justify the
   performance of the methods in terms of classification accuracy and Kappa
   index. The results confirm that the proposed IEM method is superior to
   the common state-of-art methods. Furthermore, we apply IEM to predict
   the occurrence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) after a gestational DM.
   Our research helps identify the risk factors for this disease;
   accordingly accurate diagnosis and prognosis can be achieved to reduce
   the morbidity and mortality rate caused by DM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Modeling the Thermal Dynamics of Buildings: A Latent-Force-Model-Based
   Approach}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Minimizing the energy consumed by heating, ventilation, and air
   conditioning (HVAC) systems of residential buildings without impacting
   occupants' comfort has been highlighted as an important artificial
   intelligence (AI) challenge. Typically, approaches that seek to address
   this challenge use a model that captures the thermal dynamics within a
   building, also referred to as a thermal model. Among thermal models,
   gray-box models are a popular choice for modeling the thermal dynamics
   of buildings. They combine knowledge of the physical structure of a
   building with various data-driven inputs and are accurate estimators of
   the state (internal temperature). However, existing gray-box models
   require a detailed specification of all the physical elements that can
   affect the thermal dynamics of a building a priori. This limits their
   applicability, particularly in residential buildings, where additional
   dynamics can be induced by human activities such as cooking, which
   contributes additional heat, or opening of windows, which leads to
   additional leakage of heat. Since the incidence of these additional
   dynamics is rarely known, their combined effects cannot readily be
   accommodated within existing models.
   To overcome this limitation and improve the general applicability of
   gray-box models, we introduce a novel model, which we refer to as a
   latent force thermal model of the thermal dynamics of a building, or
   LFM-TM. Our model is derived from an existing gray-box thermal model,
   which is augmented with an extra term referred to as the learned
   residual. This term is capable of modeling the effect of any a priori
   unknown additional dynamic, which, if not captured, appears as a
   structure in a thermal model's residual (the error induced by the
   model). More importantly, the learned residual can also capture the
   effects of physical elements such as a building's envelope or the lags
   in a heating system, leading to a significant reduction in complexity
   compared to existing models.
   To evaluate the performance of LFM-TM, we apply it to two independent
   data sources. The first is an established dataset, referred to as the
   FlexHouse data, which was previously used for evaluating the efficacy of
   existing gray-box models {[}Bacher and Madsen 2011]. The second dataset
   consists of heating data logged within homes located on the University
   of Southampton campus, which were specifically instrumented to collect
   data for our thermal modeling experiments. On both datasets, we show
   that LFM-TM outperforms existing models in its ability to accurately fit
   the observed data, generate accurate day-ahead internal temperature
   predictions, and explain a large amount of the variability in the future
   observations. This, along with the fact that we also use a corresponding
   efficient sequential inference scheme for LFM-TM, makes it an ideal
   candidate for model-based predictive control, where having accurate
   online predictions of internal temperatures is essential for
   high-quality solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion recognition via facial expressions (ERFE) has attracted a great
   deal of interest with recent advances in artificial intelligence and
   pattern recognition. Most studies are based on 2D images, and their
   performance is usually computationally expensive. In this paper, we
   propose a real-time emotion recognition approach based on both 2D and 3D
   facial expression features captured by Kinect sensors. To capture the
   deformation of the 3D mesh during facial expression, we combine the
   features of animation units (AUs) and feature point positions (FPPs)
   tracked by Kinect. A fusion algorithm based on improved emotional
   profiles (IEPs) and maximum confidence is proposed to recognize emotions
   with these real-time facial expression features. Experiments on both an
   emotion dataset and a real-time video show the superior performance of
   our method.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has been introduced recently for
   solving optimization problems. The ABC algorithm is based on intelligent
   foraging behavior of honeybee swarms and has many advantages over
   earlier swarm intelligence algorithms. In this work, a new method based
   on ABC algorithm for designing two-channel quadrature mirror filter
   (QMF) banks with linear phase is presented. To satisfy the perfect
   reconstruction condition, low-pass prototype filter coefficients are
   optimized to minimize an objective function. The objective function is
   formulated as a weighted sum of four terms, pass-band error, and
   stop-band residual energy of low-pass analysis filter, square error of
   the overall transfer function at the quadrature frequency and amplitude
   distortion of the QMF bank. The design results of the proposed method
   are compared with earlier reported results of particle swarm
   optimization (PSO), differential-evolution (DE) and conventional
   optimization algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social online learning environments provide new recommendation
   opportunities to meet users' needs. However, current educational
   recommender systems do not usually take advantage of these
   opportunities. To progress on this issue, we have proposed a knowledge
   engineering approach based on human-computer interaction (i.e.
   user-centred design as defined by the standard ISO 9241-210:2010) and
   artificial intelligence techniques (i.e. data mining) that involve
   educators in the process of eliciting educational oriented
   recommendations. To date, this approach differs from most recommenders
   in education in focusing on identifying relevant actions to be
   recommended on e-learning services from a user-centric perspective, thus
   widening the range of recommendation types. This approach has been used
   to identify 32 recommendations that consider several types of actions,
   which focus on promoting active participation of learners and on
   strengthening the sharing of experiences among peers through the usage
   of the social services provided by the learning environment. The paper
   describes where data mining techniques have been applied to complement
   the user-centred design methods to produce social oriented

Abstract = {{Our research focuses on the application of airlift contactors (ALRs) for
   the decontamination of CO2-containing gas streams, such as biogas. To
   assess the performance of ALRs during CO2 absorption, a complex
   experimental programme was applied in a laboratory-scale rectangular
   pneumatic contactor, able to operate either as a bubble column or as an
   airlift reactor. Using the experimental data, a model based on
   artificial neural network (ANN) was developed. The algorithm for
   determining the optimal neural network model and for reactor
   optimization is clonal selection (CS), belonging to artificial immune
   system class, which is a new computational intelligence paradigm based
   on the principles of the vertebrate immune system. To improve its
   capabilities and the probability for highly suitable models and input
   combinations, addressing maximum efficiency, a Back-Propagation (BK)
   algorithm - a supervised learning method based on the delta rule - is
   used as a local search procedure. It is applied in a greedy manner for
   the best antibody found in each generation. Since the highest affinity
   antibodies are cloned in the next generation, the effect of BK on the
   suitability of the individuals propagates into a large proportion of the
   population. In parallel with the BK hybridization of the basic CS-ANN
   combination, a series of normalization procedures are included for
   improving the overall results provided by the new algorithm called
   nCS-MBK (normalized Clonal Selection-Multilayer Perceptron Neural
   Network and Back-Propagation algorithm). The optimization allowed for
   achieving the optimal reactor configuration, which leads to a maximum
   amount of CO2 dissolved in water.}},

Abstract = {{Power system loads are one of the crucial elements of modern power
   systems and, as such, must be properly modelled in stability studies.
   However, the static and dynamic characteristics of a load are commonly
   unknown, extremely nonlinear, and are usually time varying.
   Consequently, a measurement-based approach for determining the load
   characteristics would offer a significant advantage since it could
   update the parameters of load models directly from the available system
   measurements. For this purpose and in order to accurately determine load
   model parameters, a suitable parameter estimation method must be
   applied. The conventional approach to this problem favors the use of
   standard nonlinear estimators or artificial intelligence (AI)-based
   methods. In this paper, a new solution for determining the unknown load
   model parameters is proposed-an improved particle swarm optimization
   (IPSO) method. The proposed method is an AI-type technique similar to
   the commonly used genetic algorithms (GAs) and is shown to provide a
   promising alternative. This paper presents a performance comparison of
   IPSO and GA using computer simulations and measured data obtained from
   realistic laboratory experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The basic indicators of a researcher's productivity and impact are still
   the number of publications and their citation counts. These metrics are
   clear, straightforward, and easy to obtain. When a ranking of scholars
   is needed, for instance in grant, award, or promotion procedures, their
   use is the fastest and cheapest way of prioritizing some scientists over
   others. However, due to their nature, there is a danger of
   oversimplifying scientific achievements. Therefore, many other
   indicators have been proposed including the usage of the PageRank
   algorithm known for the ranking of webpages and its modifications suited
   to citation networks. Nevertheless, this recursive method is
   computationally expensive and even if it has the advantage of favouring
   prestige over popularity, its application should be well justified,
   particularly when compared to the standard citation counts. In this
   study, we analyze three large datasets of computer science papers in the
   categories of artificial intelligence, software engineering, and theory
   and methods and apply 12 different ranking methods to the citation
   networks of authors. We compare the resulting rankings with selfcompiled
   lists of outstanding researchers selected as frequent editorial board
   members of prestigious journals in the field and conclude that there is
   no evidence of PageRank-based methods outperforming simple citation
   counts. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The enduring innovations in artificial intelligence and robotics offer
   the promised capacity of computer consciousness, sentience and
   rationality. The development of these advanced technologies have been
   considered to merit rights, however these can only be ascribed in the
   context of commensurate responsibilities and duties. This represents the
   discernable next-step for evolution in this field. Addressing these
   needs requires attention to the philosophical perspectives of moral
   responsibility for artificial intelligence and robotics. A contrast to
   the moral status of animals may be considered. At a practical level, the
   attainment of responsibilities by artificial intelligence and robots can
   benefit from the established responsibilities and duties of human
   society, as their subsistence exists within this domain. These
   responsibilities can be further interpreted and crystalized through
   legal principles, many of which have been conserved from ancient Roman
   law. The ultimate and unified goal of stipulating these responsibilities
   resides through the advancement of mankind and the enduring preservation
   of the core tenets of humanity.}},

Abstract = {{In our previous research we investigated the structure of the Primary
   Language of the human brain as introduced by J. von Neumann in 1957. Two
   components have been investigated, the algorithm optimizing warfighting,
   Linguistic Geometry (LG), and the algorithm for inventing new
   algorithms, the Algorithm of Discovery. The ultimate goal of this
   research and the emphasis of this paper is to make the next step to
   understanding the Algorithm of Discovery. Our results, introduced in the
   recent papers, show that this algorithm is based on multiple thought
   experiments which manifest themselves via mental visual streams
   ({''}mental movies{''}). It appears that those streams are the only
   interface available for this brain phenomenon. The visual streams can
   run concurrently and can exchange information between each other. The
   streams may initiate additional thought experiments, program them, and
   execute them in due course. Our research reveals the role of analogy in
   constructing visual model by erasing the particulars of simple examples,
   utilizing this model as a reference for constructing the new visual
   object and a symbolic shell attached to this object in the form of
   symbolic tags. This paper investigates new hypotheses related to the
   structure of visual streams of the Algorithm of Discovery. They include
   the nested streams, the programmed experiments, the visual model, the
   construction set and the Ghost play. These hypotheses are tested on the
   thought experiments for development of two algorithms in LG: functions
   next and med for the Grammars of Shortest and Admissible Trajectories
   and the No-Search Approach based on the State Space Chart. While those
   algorithms were partly investigated in our earlier papers this paper
   goes much deeper, i.e., closer to revealing the nature of the Algorithm
   of Discovery.}},

Abstract = {{Spoken emotion recognition is currently a very active research topic and
   has attracted extensive attention in signal processing, pattern
   recognition, artificial intelligence, etc. In this paper, a new emotion
   classification method based on kernel sparse representation, named
   locality-constrained kernel sparse representation-based classification
   (LC-KSRC), is proposed for spoken emotion recognition. LC-KSRC is able
   to learn more discriminating sparse representation coefficients for
   spoken emotion recognition, since it integrates both sparsity and data
   locality in the kernel feature space. The proposed method is compared
   with six representative emotion classification methods, including linear
   discriminant classifier, K-nearest-neighbor, radial basis function
   neural networks, support vector machines, sparse representation-based
   classification and kernel sparse representation-based classification.
   Experimental results on two publicly available emotional speech
   databases, i.e., the Berlin database and the Polish database,
   demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method on spoken
   emotion recognition tasks, outperforming the other used methods.}},

Abstract = {{Although the original vision for artificial intelligence was the
   simulation of (implicitly human) intelligence, research has gradually
   shifted to autonomous systems that compete with people. The resultant
   popular attitude toward artificial intelligence, we argue here, is by
   turns disdain, grudging acceptance, and fear. That attitude not only
   limits our work's potential, but also imperils its support. This paper
   proposes a constructive alternative: the development of collaborative
   intelligence. As envisioned here, a collaborative intelligence does not
   require encyclopedic command and need not be limited to a single
   problem. The necessary components of a collaborative intelligence are
   nearly at hand, and the key issues readily identified. As a first step,
   this paper proposes three challenging but accessible problems that would
   both change the public perception of artificial intelligence and spur
   substantive research to advance our science. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Animals help to sustain the environment's life cycle and ecosystem.
   Without human intervention, these creatures carry out their `spontaneous
   routine' jobs and contribute towards balance in nature. Any natural
   system that congregates as a result of some form of collective
   intelligence of nature is also known as swarm intelligence (SI). This
   metaphor inspires a variety of techniques to solve the problem of
   calculating, in most cases dealing with optimization problems and has
   sparked interest amongst scientists. It is very trying for a new
   researcher to understand the whole concept of swarming robotics (SR) and
   optimization algorithm (i.e. realizing the idea from animal's perception
   to the SR application). In addition, the existing algorithms are
   computationally complicated, difficult to be understood by beginners as
   there are too many parameters. Thus, in this paper, we simplify the
   three branches of the main applications which are frequently used for SI
   namely: (1) optimization and networks design, (2) prediction and
   forecasting, and (3) SR. This paper summarizes the basic understanding
   overview of swarming robotics and discusses their basic concepts and

Abstract = {{Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be defined as the application of
   science and engineering with the intent of intelligent machine
   composition. It involves using tool based on intelligent behavior of
   humans in solving complex issues, designed in a way to make computers
   execute tasks that were earlier thought of human intelligence
   involvement. In comparison to other computational automations, AI
   facilitates and enables time reduction based on personnel needs and most
   importantly, the operational expenses.
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an area of great interest and
   significance in petroleum exploration and production. Over the years, it
   has made an impact in the industry, and the application has continued to
   grow within the oil and gas industry. The application in E \& P industry
   has more than 16 years of history with first application dated 1989, for
   well log interpretation; drill bit diagnosis using neural networks and
   intelligent reservoir simulator interface. It has been propounded in
   solving many problems in the oil and gas industry which includes,
   seismic pattern recognition, reservoir characterisation, permeability
   and porosity prediction, prediction of PVT properties, drill bits
   diagnosis, estimating pressure drop in pipes and wells, optimization of
   well production, well performance, portfolio management and general
   decision making operations and many more.
   This paper reviews and analyzes the successful application of artificial
   intelligence techniques as related to one of the major aspects of the
   oil and gas industry, drilling capturing the level of application and
   trend in the industry. A summary of various papers and reports
   associated with artificial intelligence applications and it limitations
   will be highlighted. This analysis is expected to contribute to further
   development of this technique and also determine the neglected areas in

Abstract = {{The early detection abnormal fermentations (sluggish and stuck) is one
   of the main problems that appear in wine production, due to the
   significant impacts in wine quality and utility. This situation is
   specially important in Chile, which is one of the top ten worldwide wine
   production countries. In last years, two different methods coming from
   Computational Intelligence have been applied to solve this problem:
   Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. In this work we
   present the main results that have been obtained to detect abnormal wine
   fermentations applying these approaches. The Support Vector Machine
   method with radial basis kernel present the best results for the time
   cutoffs considered (72 {[}hr] and 96 {[}hr]) over all the techniques
   studied with respect to prediction rates and number of the training

   on an original concept in which competitive and learning vector
   quantization (LVQ) neural networks are used to partition the power
   system. Secondly, pilot buses are chosen to represent the most
   controllable buses in each area. Finally, discrete controllers are
   designed to overcome and avoid propagation of disturbances on the

   Hydro-Quebec network are presented in this paper and show the
   effectiveness and performance of the controllers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In industrial oil furnaces, unstable flames can lead to potentially
   dangerous conditions. For this reason, elaborate control systems are
   used to monitor the various parameters of the process that could become
   the source of such problems. A current trend in research is the one that
   seeks to apply artificial intelligence techniques to efficiently
   identify a priory anomalous behavior of the flames, so as to help
   improving the time response of the automatic control. In system dynamics
   theory, it is common sense that an accurate modeling of the process
   under study directly affects the performance of the controlling
   apparatus. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the process, physical
   models of flame propagation are still not as much faithful as they
   should to be used for control purposes. On the other hand, could the
   complex dynamics of flame propagation be described in terms of an
   identified assumed model, one would come up with a tool for the
   improvement of the control strategy. In this work, a new approach based
   on Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) tools is used to identify four
   degree-of-freedom second order state-space models of oil flame dynamics
   in a prototype furnace. Grabbed images of a CCD camera, after being
   processed through a computer vision method, provide sets of
   characteristic vectors which, then, serve as input data to an
   identification OMA algorithm based on the Ibrahim Time Domain Method.
   Models of unstable and stable flames are built and validated through
   spectral analysis of the reconstructed time-domain characteristic
   vectors. The truthfulness of the validation scheme was then confirmed by
   a quantitative modal assurance criterion modified to suit the current
   application. On the grounds of the results obtained, it is possible to
   assert that the proposed approach for the description of flame dynamics
   can likely predict the occurrence of unstable conditions, thus becoming
   another tool that might be used in an automated control system. (C) 2014

Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Inclusion of statistical knowledge of the primary user (PU) channel
   usage had shown to be beneficial in dynamic spectrum access. Motivated
   by this fact, this paper investigated the importance of collecting and
   using statistics on neighboring secondary users (SUs) in selecting
   channels in addition to the knowledge of PU channel usage. The paper
   assumed that PU traffic characteristics of the channels are included in
   the radio environment map in the form of probabilistic suffix trees,
   which is a sequence predictor based on Markov property. In the proposed
   method, an intelligent sequence hopping-based common control channel and
   a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)/collision avoidance (CA)-based
   medium access control (MAC) protocol were introduced. As shown in the
   paper, selecting channels using statistics of both the neighboring SUs
   and PUs reduced the number of packet collisions compared to a scheme
   which only uses PU statistics. Furthermore, the simulation results
   showed that the scheme proposed had better throughput performance with
   respect to both the random channel selection scheme and the scheme which

Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Challenges in many real-world optimization problems arise from limited
   hardware availability, particularly when the optimization must be
   performed on a device whose hardware is highly restricted due to cost or
   space. This paper proposes a new algorithm, namely Enhanced compact
   Artificial Bee Colony (EcABC) to address this class of optimization
   problems. The algorithm benefits from the search logic of the Artificial
   Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, and similar to other compact algorithms, it
   does not store the actual population of tentative solutions. Instead,
   EcABC employs a novel probabilistic representation of the population
   that is introduced in this paper. The proposed algorithm has been tested
   on a set of benchmark functions from the CEC2013 benchmark suite, and
   compared against a number of algorithms including modern compact
   algorithms, recent population-based ABC variants and some advanced
   meta-heuristics. Numerical results demonstrate that EcABC significantly
   outperforms other state of the art compact algorithms. In addition,
   simulations also indicate that the proposed algorithm shows a
   comparative performance when compared against its population-based
   versions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An artificial intelligence (AI)-based methodology is proposed for the
   damage diagnosis of beam members of engineering structures under complex
   loading conditions. The current proposed method has been developed using
   particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. A single transverse
   open-edge crack has been developed on a beam structure, modeled by a
   local flexibility matrix that is calculated analytically to determine
   natural frequencies and mode shapes. The modified PSO employs the
   strategy of nonlinearly decreasing inertia weight, which varies from a
   large value to a small value. Furthermore, a fuzzy adaptive PSO (APSO)
   has been used that incorporates the dynamically varying inertia weight
   based on the variance of the population fitness. Numerical and

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{On-the-fly composition of service-based software solutions is still a
   challenging task. Even more challenges emerge when facing automatic
   service composition in markets of composed services for end users. In
   this paper, we focus on the functional discrepancy between ``what a user
   wants{''} specified in terms of a request and ``what a user gets{''}
   when executing a composed service. To meet the challenge of functional
   discrepancy, we propose the combination of existing symbolic composition
   approaches with machine learning techniques. We developed a learning
   recommendation system that expands the capabilities of existing
   composition algorithms to facilitate adaptivity and consequently reduces
   functional discrepancy. As a representative of symbolic techniques, an
   Artificial Intelligence planning based approach produces solutions that
   are correct with respect to formal specifications. Our learning
   recommendation system supports the symbolic approach in decision-making.
   Reinforcement Learning techniques enable the recommendation system to
   adjust its recommendation strategy over time based on user ratings. We
   implemented the proposed functionality in terms of a prototypical
   composition framework. Preliminary results from experiments conducted in
   the image processing domain illustrate the benefit of combining both
   complementary techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, a popular swarm intelligence
   technique based on the intelligent foraging behavior of honey bees, is
   good at exploration but poor at exploitation. Grenade Explosion Method
   (GEM) which mimics the mechanism of a grenade explosion has high
   reliability and fast convergence. Two modified versions of ABC inspired
   by GEM, namely GABC1 and GABC2, are first proposed to enhance the
   classical ABC's exploitation ability. GEM is embedded in the employed
   bees' phase of GABC1, whereas it is embedded in the onlooker bees' phase
   of GABC2. The performance differences between GABC1 and GABC2 were
   assessed on two sets of well-known benchmark functions and compared with
   that of the classical ABC and several other improved ABC algorithms. The
   experiments show that GABC1 has similar or better performance than GABC2
   in most cases, but GABC2 performs more robust and effective than GABC1
   on all the functions, they significantly outperform the competitors.
   These results suggest that the proposed algorithms can effectively serve
   as alternatives for solving global optimization problems. (C) 2014

Journal = {{IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{86-97}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Despite recent advances in artificial intelligence and autonomous
   robotics, teleoperation can provide distinct benefits in applications
   requiring real-time human judgement and intuition. However, as robotic
   systems are increasingly becoming sophisticated and are performing more
   complex tasks, realizing these benefits requires new approaches to
   teleoperation. This paper introduces a novel haptic mediator interface
   for teleoperating mobile robotic platforms that have a variety of
   manipulators and functions. Identical master-slave bilateral
   teleoperation of the robotic manipulators is achieved by representing
   them in virtual reality and by allowing the operator to interact with
   them using a multipoint haptic device. The operator is also able to
   command motions to the mobile platform by using a novel haptic
   interaction metaphor rather than a separate dedicated input device. The
   presented interaction techniques enable the operator to perform a wide
   range of control functions and achieve functionality similar to that of
   conventional teleoperation schemes that use a single haptic interface.
   The mediator interface is presented, and important considerations such
   as workspace mapping and scaling are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Videogames are one of the most important and profitable sectors in the
   industry of entertainment. Nowadays, the creation of a videogame is
   often a large-scale endeavor and bears many similarities with, e.g.,
   movie production. On the central tasks in the development of a videogame
   is content generation, namely the definition of maps, terrains,
   non-player characters (NPCs) and other graphical, musical and AI-related
   components of the game. Such generation is costly due to its complexity,
   the great amount of work required and the need of specialized manpower.
   Hence the relevance of optimizing the process and alleviating costs. In
   this sense, procedural content generation (PCG) comes in handy as a
   means of reducing costs by using algorithmic techniques to automatically
   generate some game contents. PCG also provides advantages in terms of
   player experience since the contents generated are typically not fixed
   but can vary in different playing sessions, and can even adapt to the
   player herself. For this purpose, the underlying algorithmic technique
   used for PCG must be also flexible and adaptable. This is the case of
   computational intelligence in general and evolutionary algorithms in
   particular. In this work we shall provide an overview of the use of
   evolutionary intelligence for PCG, with special emphasis on its use
   within the context of real-time strategy games. We shall show how these
   techniques can address both playability and aesthetics, as well as
   improving the game AI.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is one of the most recently
   introduced swarm intelligence algorithms which inspired by the foraging
   behavior of honey bee swarms. It has been widely used in numerical and
   engineering optimization problems. This paper presents a hybrid
   artificial bee colony (HABC) model to improve the canonical ABC
   algorithm. The main idea of HABC is to enhance the information exchange
   between bees by introducing the crossover operator of genetic algorithm
   to ABC. With suitable crossover operation, valuable information is fully
   utilized and it is expected that the algorithm can converge faster and
   more accurate. Eight versions of HABC algorithm combined by different
   selection and crossover methods under the model were proposed and tested
   on several benchmark functions. Then, the settings of the new parameter
   crossover rate for two well performed HABC versions are tested to verify
   their best values. Finally, four rotated functions and four shifted
   functions are used to test the performance of the two algorithms on
   complex functions and asymmetric functions. Experiment results showed
   that these two versions of HABC algorithm offer significant improvement
   over the original ABC and are superior to other two state of the art
   algorithms on some functions.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes research in which embodied imitation and
   behavioral adaptation are investigated in collective robotics. We model
   social learning in artificial agents with real robots. The robots are
   able to observe and learn each others' movement patterns using their
   on-board sensors only, so that imitation is embodied. We show that the
   variations that arise from embodiment allow certain behaviors that are
   better adapted to the process of imitation to emerge and evolve during
   multiple cycles of imitation. As these behaviors are more robust to
   uncertainties in the real robots' sensors and actuators, they can be
   learned by other members of the collective with higher fidelity. Three
   different types of learned-behavior memory have been experimentally
   tested to investigate the effect of memory capacity on the evolution of
   movement patterns, and results show that as the movement patterns evolve
   through multiple cycles of imitation, selection, and variation, the
   robots are able to, in a sense, agree on the structure of the behaviors
   that are imitated.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time load composition knowledge will dramatically benefit
   demand-side management (DSM). Previous works disaggregate the load via
   either intrusive or nonintrusive load monitoring. However, due to the
   difficulty in accessing all houses via smart meters at all times and the
   unavailability of frequently measured high-resolution load signatures at
   bulk supply points, neither is suitable for frequent or widespread
   application. This paper employs the artificial intelligence (AI) tool to
   develop a load disaggregation approach for bulk supply points based on
   the substation rms measurement without relying on smart meter data,
   customer surveys, or high-resolution load signatures. Monte Carlo
   simulation is used to generate the training and validation data. Load
   compositions obtained by the AI tool are compared with the validation
   data and used for load characteristics estimation and validation.
   Probabilistic distributions and confidence levels of different
   confidence intervals for errors of load compositions and load
   characteristics are also derived.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Semantic trees are a particular type of trees widely used in the
   representation of the concepts and their relations. Therefore, a
   computational model of the reality can be built and processed by
   Artificial Intelligence algorithms to infer knowledge, make decisions,
   etc. In this work, the design of a hardware component to accelerate
   reasoning operations on semantic trees by means of an FPGA based
   platform is presented. The target application is common-sense reasoning
   where marker-passing algorithms work on semantic tree structures; the
   core of the Scone Knowledge-Based system.
   On top of the functionality to be implemented, a strategy to deal with
   the implementation in reconfigurable hardware of dynamic and recursive
   data structures has been envisioned. Since lists, graphs or trees are
   the cornerstone in the modelling of computer friendly solutions for
   complex problems; this proposal contributes to reduce the breach between
   the software and silicon domains.
   As a result, an optimized micro-architecture of an FPGA accelerator for
   marker-passer algorithms integrated into a heterogeneous computing
   platform, and a smart data mapping procedure have been delivered. The
   design has been prototyped on a Xilinx ML507 board and compared to an
   equivalent software implementation, showing a significant reduction in
   execution times. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Path planning is a fundamental problem in many areas, ranging from
   robotics and artificial intelligence to computer graphics and animation.
   Although there is extensive literature for computing optimal,
   collision-free paths, there is relatively little work that explores the
   satisfaction of spatial constraints between objects and agents at the
   global navigation layer. This paper presents a planning framework that
   satisfies multiple spatial constraints imposed on the path. The type of
   constraints specified can include staying behind a building, walking
   along walls, or avoiding the line of sight of patrolling agents. We
   introduce two hybrid environment representations that balance
   computational efficiency and search space density to provide a minimal,
   yet sufficient, discretization of the search graph for constraint-aware
   navigation. An extended anytime dynamic planner is used to compute
   constraint-aware paths, while efficiently repairing solutions to account
   for varying dynamic constraints or an updating world model. We
   demonstrate the benefits of our method on challenging navigation
   problems in complex environments for dynamic agents using combinations
   of hard and soft, attracting and repelling constraints, defined by both
   static obstacles and moving obstacles. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{In compliance with the Quality Assurance Framework for Earth Observation
   (QA4EO) guidelines, the goal of this paper is to provide a theoretical
   comparison and an experimental quality assessment of two operational
   (ready-for-use) expert systems (prior knowledge-based nonadaptive
   decision trees) for automatic near real-time preattentional
   classification and segmentation of spaceborne/airborne multispectral
   (MS) images: the Satellite Image Automatic Mapper (TM) (SIAM (TM))
   software product and the Spectral Classification of surface reflectance
   signatures (SPECL) secondary product of the Atmospheric/Topographic
   Correction (TM) (ATCOR (TM)) commercial software toolbox. For the sake
   of simplicity, this paper is split into two: Part 1-Theory, presented
   herein, and Part 2-Experimental results, already published elsewhere.
   The main theoretical contribution of the present Part 1 is threefold.
   First, it provides the published Part 2 with an interdisciplinary
   terminology and a theoretical background encompassing multiple
   disciplines, such as philosophical hermeneutics, machine learning,
   artificial intelligence, computer vision, human vision, and remote
   sensing (RS). Second, it highlights the several degrees of novelty of
   the ATCOR-SPECL and SIAM deductive preliminary classifiers
   (preclassifiers) at the four levels of abstraction of an information
   processing system, namely, system design, knowledge/information
   representation, algorithms, and implementation. Third, the present Part
   1 requires the experimental Part 2 to collect a minimum set of
   complementary statistically independent metrological quality indicators
   (QIs) of operativeness (QIOs), in compliance with the QA4EO guidelines
   and the principles of statistics. In particular, sample QIs are required
   to be: 1) statistically significant, i.e., provided with a degree of
   uncertainty in measurement; and 2) statistically valid (consistent),
   i.e., representative of the entire population being sampled, which
   requires the implementation of a probability sampling protocol. Largely
   overlooked by the RS community, these sample QI requirements are almost
   never satisfied in the RS common practice. As a consequence, to date,
   QIOs of existing RS image understanding systems (RS-IUSs), including
   thematic map accuracy, remain largely unknown in statistical terms. The
   conclusion of the present Part 1 is that the proposed comparison of the
   two alternative ATCOR-SPECL and SIAM prior knowledge-based
   preclassifiers in operating mode, accomplished in the Part 2, can be
   considered appropriate, well-timed, and of potential interest to a large
   portion of the RS readership.}},

Abstract = {{Board-game applications are frequently found in mobile devices where the
   computing performance and the energy budget are constrained. Since the
   Artificial Intelligence techniques applied in these games are
   computationally intensive, the applications developed for mobile systems
   are frequently simplistic, far from the level of equivalent applications
   developed for desktop computers.
   Currently board games are software applications executed on General
   Purpose Processors. However, they exhibit a medium degree of parallelism
   and a custom hardware accelerator implemented on an FPGA can take
   advantage of that.
   We have selected the well-known Reversi game as a case study because it
   is a very popular board game with simple rules but huge computational
   demands. We developed and optimized software and hardware designs for
   this game that apply the same classical Artificial Intelligence
   techniques. The applications have been executed on different
   representative platforms and the results demonstrate that the FPGAs
   implementations provide better performance, lower power consumption and,
   therefore, impressive energy savings. These results demonstrate that
   FPGAs can efficiently deal with this kind of problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents an educational software tool to teach Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically Hyper-heuristics, to
   Engineering students. This tool is based on the Bubble Breaker puzzle,
   an addictive game consisting in an MxM matrix of colored bubbles. These
   balls, when forming sets of two or more same colored balls, can be
   popped and cleared out. Thus, this puzzle can be solved by setting many
   different low-level heuristics and applying a global search procedure
   (i.e., evolutionary algorithm) that conforms a robust hyper-heuristic
   technique. The hyper-heuristic decides what low-level heuristics are the
   best, and the sequential way in which they have to be applied to gain
   the highest score. This approach has proven an interesting method to
   teach AI techniques, since simple heuristics, evolutionary algorithms,
   and its combination are studied in an increasing manner. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{The game of Amazons is a modern board game with simple rules and nice
   mathematical properties. It has a high computational complexity. In
   2001, the starting position on a 5 5 board was proven to be a first
   player win. The enhanced Amazons solver presented here extends previous
   work in the following five ways: by building more powerful endgame
   databases, including a new type of databases for so-called blocker
   territories, by improving the rules for computing bounds on complex game
   positions, by local search to find tighter local bounds, by using ideas
   from combinatorial game theory to find wins earlier, and by using a
   df-pn based solver. Using the improved solver, the starting positions
   for Amazons on the 4 x 5, 5 x 4, 4 x 6, 5 x 6, and 4 x 7 boards were
   shown to be first player wins, while 6 x 4 is a second player win. The
   largest proof, for the 5 x 6 board, is presented in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Within the last years, probabilistic causality has become a very active
   research topic in artificial intelligence and statistics communities.
   Due to its high impact in various applications involving reasoning
   tasks, machine learning researchers have proposed a number of techniques
   to learn Causal Bayesian Networks. Within the existing works in this
   direction, few studies have explicitly considered the role that
   decisional guidance might play to alternate between observational and
   experimental data processing. In this paper, we go further by
   introducing a serendipitous strategy to elucidate semantic background
   knowledge provided by the domain ontology to learn the causal structure
   of Bayesian Networks. We also complement our contribution with an
   enrichment process by which it will be possible to reuse these causal
   discoveries, support the evolving character of the semantic background
   and make an ontology evolution. Finally, the proposed method will be
   validated through simulations and real data analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Multiobjective swarm intelligence for the traffic grooming problem}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{479-511}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The future of optical networks is focused on Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (WDM) technology. WDM allows simultaneous transmissions of
   traffic on many non-overlapping channels (wavelengths). Since nowadays
   the majority of traffic requests only require a bandwidth of Mbps, there
   exists a waste of bandwidth in these non-overlapping channels because
   they support traffic in Gbps range. For exploiting the optical network
   resources effectively, several low-speed traffic requests can be groomed
   onto a wavelength channel, which is not a simple task. In fact, it is
   known as the Traffic Grooming problem, and is considered an optimization
   problem (NP-hard problem). In this work, we suggest the use of
   multiobjective evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence jointly
   for solving the Traffic Grooming problem. We have proposed the following
   swarm algorithms: Artificial Bee Colony, Gravitational Search Algorithm,
   and Firefly Algorithm; but adapted to multiobjective field: MO-ABC,
   MO-GSA, and MO-FA respectively. Furthermore, we have adapted the
   well-known Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2, Fast Nondominated
   Sorting Genetic Algorithm, and Multiobjective Selection Based On
   Dominated Hypervolume to the Traffic Grooming problem with the aim of
   evaluating the quality of our swarm proposals. Finally, we present
   several comparisons with other heuristics and metaheuristics published
   in the literature by other authors. After comparing with them, we
   conclude that our approaches overcome the results obtained by other
   approaches published by other authors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on optimisation of process parameters of the turning

   learning machine by mapping into high-dimensional kernel-induced feature
   space. The genetic algorithm is integrated with these to find the
   optimum from the response surface generated. The results are compared
   with those obtained by integrating GA with traditional models like
   response surface methodology (RSM) and regression analysis (RA). This

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Organizations frequently adopt multiple strategies to satisfy
   conflicting and competing goals. Modeling the organizational
   characteristics associated with such hybrid strategies is an important
   challenge for organization scientists. This study proposes the use of a
   novel evidence-based computational approach to the ambiguous
   classification of organizations (N-state Classification and Ranking
   Belief Simplex or NCaRBS) to model hybrid organizational strategies.
   Drawing on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence methodology, the
   computational mechanics of NCaRBS are illustrated by modelling hybrid
   configurations of Miles and Snow's (Organizational strategy, structure
   and process, 1978) classic strategic stances: prospecting, defending and
   reacting. Analysis is carried out using data on the characteristics of
   over 100 organizations. The results show that NCaRBS is uniquely able to
   demonstrate the full range of ambiguity in the relationships between
   contingent organizational characteristics. Further potential
   applications of NCaRBS in the field of computational and mathematical
   organization theory are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The number of satellites and sensors devoted to Earth observation has
   become increasingly elevated, delivering extensive data, especially
   images. At the same time, the access to such data and the tools needed
   to process them has considerably improved. In the presence of such data
   flow, we need automatic image interpretation methods, especially when it
   comes to the monitoring and prediction of environmental and societal
   changes in highly dynamic socio-environmental contexts. This could be
   accomplished via artificial intelligence.
   The concept described here relies on the induction of classification
   rules that explicitly take into account structural knowledge, using
   Aleph, an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system, combined with a
   multi-class classification procedure. This methodology was used to
   monitor changes in land cover/use of the French Guiana coastline. One
   hundred and fifty-eight classification rules were induced from 3
   diachronic land cover/use maps including 38 classes. These rules were
   expressed in first order logic language, which makes them easily
   understandable by non-experts. A 10-fold cross-validation gave
   significant average values of 84.62\%, 99.57\% and 77.22\% for
   classification accuracy, specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Our
   methodology could be beneficial to automatically classify new objects
   and to facilitate object-based classification procedures. (C) 2014

   nonlinearly transforms the weighted shortest path length between the
   compared concepts to achieve the semantic similarity results, and the
   relation between parameters and the correlation value is discussed in
   detail. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only
   achieves high correlation value against human ratings but also has
   better distribution characteristics of the correlation coefficient
   compared with several related works in the literature. In addition, the
   proposed method is computationally efficient due to the simplified ways
   of weighting the shortest path length between the concept pairs. (C)

Abstract = {{Within the last decade, abstract argumentation has emerged as a central
   field in Artificial Intelligence. Besides providing a core formalism for
   many advanced argumentation systems, abstract argumentation has also
   served to capture several non-monotonic logics and other AI related
   principles. Although the idea of abstract argumentation is appealingly
   simple, several reasoning problems in this formalism exhibit high
   computational complexity. This calls for advanced techniques when it
   comes to implementation issues, a challenge which has been recently
   faced from different angles. In this survey, we give an overview on
   different methods for solving reasoning problems in abstract
   argumentation and compare their particular features. Moreover, we
   highlight available state-of-the-art systems for abstract argumentation,
   which put these methods to practice. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Feature terms are a generalization of first-order terms which have
   recently received increased attention for their usefulness in structured
   machine learning, natural language processing and other artificial
   intelligence applications. One of the main obstacles for their wide
   usage is that, when set-valued features are allowed, their basic
   operations (subsumption, unification, and antiunification) have a very
   high computational cost. We present a Constraint Programming formulation
   of these operations, which in some cases provides orders of magnitude
   speed-ups with respect to the standard approaches. In addition,
   exploiting several symmetries that often appear in feature terms
   databases causes substantial additional savings. We provide experimental

Abstract = {{One of the big challenges in the development of probabilistic relational
   (or probabilistic logical) modeling and learning frameworks is the
   design of inference techniques that operate on the level of the abstract
   model representation language, rather than on the level of ground,
   propositional instances of the model. Numerous approaches for such
   ``lifted inference{''} techniques have been proposed. While it has been
   demonstrated that these techniques will lead to significantly more
   efficient inference on some specific models, there are only very recent
   and still quite restricted results that show the feasibility of lifted
   inference on certain syntactically defined classes of models. Lower
   complexity bounds that imply some limitations for the feasibility of
   lifted inference on more expressive model classes were established
   earlier in Jaeger (2000; Jaeger, M. 2000. On the complexity of inference
   about probabilistic relational models. Artificial Intelligence 117,
   297-308). However, it is not immediate that these results also apply to
   the type of modeling languages that currently receive the most
   attention, i.e., weighted, quantifier-free formulas. In this paper we
   extend these earlier results, and show that under the assumption that
   NETIME not equal ETIME, there is no polynomial lifted inference
   algorithm for knowledge bases of weighted, quantifier-, and
   function-free formulas. Further strengthening earlier results, this is
   also shown to hold for approximate inference and for knowledge bases not
   containing the equality predicate.}},

   Backtracking strategy (CACB) algorithm, which is based on a dynamic and
   an adaptive aggregation threshold and a backtracking strategy where
   artificial ants are allowed to turn back in their previous aggregation
   decisions. The CACB algorithm is a hierarchical clustering algorithm
   that generates compact dendrograms since it allows the aggregation of
   more than two clusters at a time. Its high performance is experimentally

Journal = {{APPLIED INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{262-275}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Reinforcement learning is one of the subjects of Artificial Intelligence
   and learning automata have been considered as one of the most powerful
   tools in this research area. On the evolution of learning automata, the
   rate of convergence is the most primary goal of designing a learning
   algorithm. In this paper, we propose a deterministic-estimator based
   learning automata (LA) of which the estimate of each action is the upper
   bound of a confidence interval, rather than the Maximum Likelihood
   Estimate (MLE) that has been widely used in current schemes of Estimator
   LA. The philosophy here is to assign more confidence on actions that are
   selected only for a few times, so that the automaton is encouraged to
   explore the uncertain actions. When all the actions have been fully
   explored, the automaton behaves just like the Generalized Pursuit
   Algorithm. A refined analysis is presented to show the oee--optimality
   of the proposed algorithm. It has been demonstrated by extensive
   simulations that the presented learning automaton (LA) is faster than
   any deterministic estimator learning automata that have been reported to
   date. Moreover, we extend our algorithm to the stochastic estimator
   schemes. It is also shown that the extended LA has achieved a
   significant performance improvement, comparing with the current state of
   the art algorithm of learning automata, especially in complex and
   confusing environments.}},

Abstract = {{The application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in modeling
   of machining process has been investigated by many researchers. Fuzzy
   logic (FL) as a well-known AI technique is effectively used in modeling
   of machining processes such as to predict the surface roughness and to
   control the cutting force in various machining processes. This paper is
   started with the introduction to definition of FL and machining process,
   and their relation. This paper then presents five types of analysis
   conducted on FL techniques used in machining process. FL was considered
   for prediction, selection, monitoring, control and optimization of
   machining process. Literature showed that milling contributed the
   highest number of machining operation that was modeled using FL. In
   terms of machining performance, surface roughness was mostly studied
   with FL model. In terms of fuzzy components, center of gravity method
   was mostly used to perform defuzzification, and triangular was mostly
   considered to perform membership function. The reviews extend the
   analysis on the abilities, limitations and effectual modifications of FL
   in modeling based on the comments from previous works that conduct
   experiment using FL in the modeling and review by few authors. The
   analysis leads the author to conclude that FL is the most popular AI
   techniques used in modeling of machining process.}},

Abstract = {{A great number of computational models of emotions (CMEs) have been
   developed to be included in, or as part of, cognitive agent
   architectures. These computational models have been designed to provide
   autonomous agents with appropriate mechanisms for the processing of
   emotional stimuli, the elicitation of synthetic emotions, and the
   generation of emotional responses. The research on CMEs has allowed for
   improvements in several application domains and contributed to progress
   in areas such as human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence.
   Nevertheless, despite the wide variety of CMEs proposed in the
   literature and their success in multiple areas, the complexity and
   quality of current and future human-centered applications require the
   development of more flexible and robust CMEs. In this sense, CMEs have
   yet to face a series of challenges in order to meet such types of
   requirements. In this paper, we explore key aspects of the development
   and applications of CMEs for autonomous agents, discuss four major
   challenges facing their development process, and present a novel
   approach to deal with these challenges.}},

Title = {{New bounds for mixed covering arrays in t-way testing with uniform
   strength}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{59}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Context: Combinatorial testing (CT) can increase the effectiveness of
   software testing by ensuring that all t-way input combinations are
   covered in a test suite. When software components have different input
   cardinalities, CT uses a mixed covering array (MCA) to represent the
   test suite. This study proposes a new methodology for constructing MCAs
   of t is an element of \{2 - 6\} by using Mixed-Tabu Search (MiTS) as the
   construction strategy.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to significantly improve the
   best bounds of MCAs of t is an element of \{2 - 6\} with uniform
   strength.
   Method: The proposed solution incorporates a new procedure for efficient
   parameter tuning where statistical testing is used to identify the
   setting values that significantly affect the performance of MiTS. For
   validation purposes, we used a robust benchmark that comprised a set of
   35 instances of real cases and a set of 95 academic instances, which
   represented the best bounds reported previously.
   Result: The experimental results showed that our MiTS-based methodology
   improved 93 bounds and matched 36 of them. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test
   demonstrated that our MiTS-based methodology significantly enhanced the
   best bounds of MCAs compared with those reported previously with 95\%
   confidence.
   Conclusion: MCAs for t-way testing with a good solution quality (in
   terms of test size), which involves artificial intelligence-based
   strategies, may be obtained by following a well-established methodology
   during the construction process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The advancement in game technology has served to enrich player's gaming
   experience in a substantial way. Nowadays, it is common to have
   blockbuster quality games, with realistic graphics and engaging stories.
   Despite this, the progress made in incorporating Artificial Intelligence
   has been slow, and realistic human-like intelligence in games is hardly
   to be found. There have been some attempts to use Machine Learning in
   games, but such attempts often ended up impractical or affecting the
   players enjoyment due to several constraining factors. In this paper, we
   describe Meme War as a proof-of-concept for practical usage of Machine
   Learning in games. We introduce Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as one
   approach to achieve a better experience in employing Machine Learning in
   games. Advantages of ELM over Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) are presented
   in terms of what ELM can offer in a practical point of view of the

   implemented on Matlab/Simulink software and tested under several types

Abstract = {{This article presents a Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony (HABC) for

   metaheuristic population-based algorithm that belongs to the Swarm

   given hard and soft constraints. The proposed hybridization comes in two
   phases: the first phase hybridized a simple local search technique as a
   local refinement process within the employed bee operator of the
   original ABC, while the second phase involves the replacement of the
   scout bee operator with the random consideration concept of harmony
   search algorithm. The former is to empower the exploitation capability
   of ABC, whereas the latter is used to control the diversity of the
   solution search space. The HABC is evaluated using a benchmark dataset

Abstract = {{Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a recent scheme for single hidden
   layer feed forward networks (SLFNs). It has attracted much interest in
   the machine intelligence and pattern recognition fields with numerous
   real-world applications. The ELM structure has several advantages, such
   as its adaptability to various problems with a rapid learning rate and
   low computational cost. However, it has shortcomings in the following
   aspects. First, it suffers from the irrelevant variables in the input
   data set. Second, choosing the optimal number of neurons in the hidden
   layer is not well defined. In case the hidden nodes are greater than the
   training data, the ELM may encounter the singularity problem, and its
   solution may become unstable. To overcome these limitations, several
   methods have been proposed within the regularization framework. In this
   article, we considered a greedy method for sparse approximation of the
   output weight vector of the ELM network. More specifically, the
   orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is embedded to the ELM. This
   new technique is named OMP-ELM. OMP-ELM has several advantages over
   regularized ELM methods, such as lower complexity and immunity to the
   singularity problem. Experimental works on nine commonly used regression
   problems indicate that the investigated OMP-ELM method confirms these
   advantages. Moreover, OMP-ELM is compared with the ELM method, the
   regularized ELM scheme, and artificial neural networks.}},

Volume = {{296}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Artificial immune system is a class of computational intelligence
   methods drawing inspiration from human immune system. As one type of
   popular artificial immune computing model, clonal selection algorithm
   (CSA) has been widely used for many optimization problems. CSA mainly
   generates new schemes by hyper-mutation operators which simulate the
   immune response process. However, these hyper-mutation operators, which
   usually perturb the antibodies in population, are semi-blind and not
   effective enough for complex optimization problems.. In this paper, we
   propose a hybrid learning clonal selection algorithm (HLCSA) by
   incorporating two learning mechanisms, Baldwinian learning and
   orthogonal learning, into CSA to guide the immune response process.
   Specifically, (1) Baldwinian learning is used to direct the genotypic
   changes based on the Baldwin effect, and this operator can enhance the
   antibody information by employing other antibodies' information to alter
   the search space; (2) Orthogonal learning operator is used to search the
   space defined by one antibody and its best Baldwinian learning vector.
   In HLCSA, the Baldwinian learning works for exploration (global search)
   while the orthogonal learning for exploitation (local refinement).
   Therefore, orthogonal learning can be viewed as the compensation for the
   search ability of Baldwinian learning. In order to validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a suite of sixteen benchmark
   test problems are fed into HLCSA. Experimental results show that HLCSA
   performs very well in solving most of the optimization problems.
   Therefore, HLCSA is an effective and robust algorithm for optimization.

Abstract = {{Psychoinformatics is an emerging discipline that uses tools from the
   information sciences to organize psychological data. This article
   supports that objective by proposing a framework for constructing
   cognition ontologies by using WordNet, FrameNet, and the Suggested Upper
   Merged Ontology (SUMO). The first section describes the major
   characteristics of each of these tools. WordNet is a large lexical data
   base that was begun in the 1980s by George Miller. FrameNet is a
   database of event schemas based on a theory of frame semantics developed
   by the linguist Charles Fillmore. SUMO is a formal ontology of concepts
   expressed in mathematical logic that supports deductive reasoning. The
   next section discusses the objectives of science ontologies and includes
   examples for psychoses and for emotion. The article then describes
   potential applications of cognition ontologies for (1) studying how
   people organize knowledge, (2) analyzing major theoretical concepts such
   as abstraction, and (3) formulating premises that can serve as a link
   between informal taxonomies and formal ontologies. The final section
   discusses extending cognition ontologies to related domains such as
   artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The advancement in the information and communication (ICT) technologies
   have resulted in the improvement of number of time consuming tasks and
   activities. These tasks have been automated with the help of advance
   information and communication (ICT) technologies. The artificial
   intelligence and multi-agents systems have made possible to automate
   number of tasks which required human decisions and complex calculations.
   This paper presents a system design approach for the development of
   Multi Agent Meeting Scheduling Simulation model and the VOMAS framework
   have being utilized for the verification and validation (V\&V) of this
   simulation Model. The verification and validation (V\&V) of the Meeting
   simulation model is based on VOMAS techniques. Our technique will permit
   the validation of agent based simulations using (VOMAS) a Virtual
   Overlay Multi-agent System. This overlay multi-agent system can comprise
   various types of agents, which form an overlay on top of the agent based
   simulation model that needs to be validated. To demonstrate the
   effectiveness of Multi agent meeting scheduling system and VOMAS
   approach, the research have shown its broad applicability in a wide
   variety of simulation models ranging from social sciences to computer
   networks in spatial and non-spatial conceptual models.}},

Abstract = {{Intelligent system (IS) using synchronous phasor measurements for
   transient stability assessment (TSA) has received continuous interests
   recently. For post-disturbance TSA, one pivotal concern is the response
   time, which was reported in the literature as a fixed value ranging from
   4 cycles to 3 s after fault clearance. Since transient instability can
   develop very fast, there is a pressing need for faster response speed.
   This paper develops a novel IS to balance the response speed and
   accuracy requirements. A set of classifiers are sequentially organised,
   each is an ensemble of extreme learning machines (ELMs), whose inputs
   are post-disturbance generator voltage trajectories and outputs are the
   classification on the stable/unstable status of the post-disturbance
   system and an evaluation of the credibility of the classification. A
   self-adaptive TSA decision-making mechanism is designed to progressively
   adjust the response time, such that the IS can do the classification
   faster, thereby allowing more time for emergency controls. The ELM
   ensemble classifiers can also be updated by on-line pre-disturbance TSA
   results due to its very fast learning speed. Case studies on the New
   England system and IEEE 50-machine system have validated the high
   efficiency and accuracy of the IS.}},

Abstract = {{Microarray gene expression data sets usually contain a large number of
   genes, but a small number of samples. In this article, we present a
   two-stage classification model by combining feature selection with the
   dissimilarity-based representation paradigm. In the preprocessing stage,
   the ReliefF algorithm is used to generate a subset with a number of
   top-ranked genes; in the learning/classification stage, the samples
   represented by the previously selected genes are mapped into a
   dissimilarity space, which is then used to construct a classifier
   capable of separating the classes more easily than a feature-based
   model. The ultimate aim of this paper is not to find the best subset of
   genes, but to analyze the performance of the dissimilarity-based models
   by means of a comprehensive collection of experiments for the
   classification of microarray gene expression data. To this end, we
   compare the classification results of an artificial neural network, a
   support vector machine and the Fisher's linear discriminant classifier
   built on the feature (gene) space with those on the dissimilarity space
   when varying the number of genes selected by ReliefF, using eight
   different microarray databases. The results show that the
   dissimilarity-based classifiers systematically outperform the
   feature-based models. In addition, classification through the proposed
   representation appears to be more robust (i.e. less sensitive to the
   number of genes) than that with the conventional feature-based
   representation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes an improved particle filter by incorporating
   semi-supervised machine learning for location estimation in mobile

   learning, the proposed particle filter can improve efficiency and
   accuracy, where the amount of available labelled training data is
   limited. The authors compare the proposed algorithm with the particle
   filter based on supervised learning. The algorithms are evaluated for
   received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based distributed location
   estimation for MSN in which communication bandwidth and accuracy of the
   range measurement are limited. First, experimental results show that the
   semi-supervised algorithm can learn suddenly-changed RSSI
   characteristics while the supervised learning cannot. Second, the
   proposed particle filter is more accurate and robust against variations
   of the environment such as new obstacle configurations. Furthermore, the
   suggested particle filter shows low statistical variability during
   repeated experiments, confirmed by much smaller error deviation than the

Abstract = {{The neural network ensemble (NINE) is a very effective way to obtain a
   good prediction performance by combining the outputs of several
   independently trained neural networks. Swarm intelligence is applied
   here to model the population of interacting agents or swarms that are
   able to self-organize. In this paper, we combine NNE and
   multi-population swarm intelligence to construct our improved neural
   network ensemble (INNE). First, each component forward neural network
   (FNN) is optimized by chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) and
   gradient gescending (GD) algorithm. Second, in contrast to most existing
   NNE training algorithm, we adopt multiple obviously different
   populations to construct swarm intelligence. As an example, one
   population is trained by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the
   others are trained by differential evolution (DE) or artificial bee
   colony algorithm (ABC). The ensemble weights are trained by
   multi-population co-evolution PSO-ABC-DE chaotic searching algorithm
   (M-PSO-ABC-DE-CS). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed novel
   INNE algorithm is superior to existing popular NNE in function
   prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Between the dawn of the Internet through year 2003, there were just a
   few dozens exabytes of information on the Web. Today, that much
   information is created weekly. The opportunity to capture the opinions
   of the general public about social events, political movements, company
   strategies, marketing campaigns, and product preferences has raised
   increasing interest both in the scientific community, for the exciting
   open challenges, and in the business world, for the remarkable fallouts
   in marketing and financial prediction. Keeping up with the ever-growing
   amount of unstructured information on the Web, however, is a formidable
   task and requires fast and efficient models for opinion mining. In this
   paper, we explore how the high generalization performance, low
   computational complexity, and fast learning speed of extreme learning
   machines can be exploited to perform analogical reasoning in a vector
   space model of affective common-sense knowledge. In particular, by
   enabling a fast reconfiguration of such a vector space, extreme learning
   machines allow the polarity associated with natural language concepts to
   be calculated in a more dynamic and accurate way and, hence, perform
   better concept-level sentiment analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL GEOSCIENCES}},

Pages = {{127-136}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The present paper discusses the essential tenets of the method whose
   purpose is to enable effective search of images of given rock in
   multimedia databases. The search is based exclusively on an image
   request, to which the system's response is a set of images presenting
   visually similar rocks. The images that constitute the basis of the
   discussed research had been registered with an optical microscope. The
   collection of images that were used in the process of performing
   measurements encompassed 5700 digital images presenting 19 rock types.
   The proposed method is based on the application of image analysis and
   artificial intelligence concepts. The very process of inference, in
   turn, makes use of the methods of data classification and grouping. In
   the paper, the authors demonstrate that these may turn out to be
   effective mathematical methods, successfully applied to the problem of
   image search, performed with imagings presenting rock textures. The
   discussed system concept, based on a feature space defined by the
   authors, successfully matches up images with the reference standard. The
   effectiveness rate of that process is very high (very often, it is 100
   \%). Failed classifications concern only the images which differ
   visually-in a considerable way-from the rest of the images within a
   given group. The proposed system concept is to facilitate the
   decision-making process involved in determining the similarity of
   investigated objects. In the opinion of the authors, it meets the
   requirements-and, as such, can be applied to the problem of searching
   for images in databases, searching discs in order to find images of
   given rocks and automatic information gain on the basis of video
   sequences, e.g., in order to find frames presenting particular rock

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development and hardware implementation of an
   autonomous battery maintenance mechatronic system that significantly
   extends the operational time of battery powered small-scaled unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs). A simultaneous change and charge approach is
   used to overcome the significant downtime experienced by existing
   charge-only approaches. The automated system quickly swaps a depleted
   battery of a UAV with a replenished one while simultaneously recharging
   several other batteries. This results in a battery maintenance system
   with low UAV downtime, arbitrarily extensible operation time, and a
   compact footprint. Hence, the system can enable multi-agent UAV missions
   that require persistent presence. This capability is illustrated by
   developing and testing in flight a centralized autonomous planning and
   learning algorithm that incorporates a probabilistic health model
   dependent on vehicle battery health that is updated during the mission,
   and replans to improve the performance based on the improved model.
   Flight test results are presented for a 3-h-long persistent mission with
   three UAVs that each has an endurance of 8-10 min on a single battery
   charge (more than 100 battery swaps).}},

Abstract = {{Structured Hybrid 3D Virtual Environments are 3D virtual spaces where
   staff (organisational) software agents support human users in their task
   achievement. These systems are characterized by: i) being hybrid, so
   that humans and software agents can interact; and ii) being structured
   and task oriented, so that interactions are regulated by a subjacent
   Organisation Centered Multi Agent System (OCMAS) - an Electronic
   Institution (EI). The contribution of this paper is to include
   task-oriented conversational staff bots (i. e. the embodiment of staff
   agents in the 3D environment) that communicate with users by using
   natural language. With this aim, we extend the Artificial Intelligence
   Mark-up Language (AIML) with special tags to enable complex
   task-oriented conversations whose flow needs to consider both the states
   of the conversation and the ontology related to the task. We evaluate
   the usability of our conversational proposal and compare it to a
   previous command-based interaction system. Results show the
   conversational approach presents a higher user satisfaction than the
   command-based one. Moreover, in average, it also performs better in
   terms of efficiency, effectiveness and errors.}},

Abstract = {{How to express and reason with cardinal directions between extended
   objects such as lines and regions is an important problem in qualitative
   spatial reasoning (QSR), a common subfield of geographical information
   science and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The direction relation matrix
   (DRM) model, proposed by Goyal and Egenhofer in 1997, is one very
   expressive relation model for this purpose. Unlike many other relation
   models in QSR, the set-theoretic converse of a DRM relation is not
   necessarily representable in DRM. Schneider et al. regard this as a
   serious shortcoming and propose, in their work published in ACM TODS
   (2012), the objects interaction matrix (OIM) model for modelling
   cardinal directions between complex regions. OIM is also a tiling-based
   model that consists of two phases: the tiling phase and the
   interpretation phase. Although it was claimed that OIM is a novel
   concept, we show that it is not so different from DRM if we represent
   the cardinal direction of two regions a and b by both the DRM of a to b
   and that of b to a. Under this natural assumption, we give methods for
   computing DRMs from OIMs and vice versa, and show that OIM is almost the
   same as DRM in the tiling phase, and becomes less precise after
   interpretation. Furthermore, exploiting the similarity between the two
   models, we prove that the consistency of a complete basic OIM network
   can be decided in cubic time. This answers an open problem raised by
   Schneider et al. regarding efficient algorithms for reasoning with OIM.}},

   unlimited times to generate innovative ideas, but can also be adjusted
   to fit a new project. Finally, we observed innovative image that the

Abstract = {{Falls are a major public health concern and main causes of accidental
   death in the senior U.S. population. Timely and accurate detection
   permit immediate assistance after a fall and, thereby, reduces

   for this purpose because it is non-invasive, insensitive to lighting
   conditions as well as obstructions, and has less privacy concerns. In
   this study, the authors develop an effective fall detection scheme for
   the application in continuous-wave radar systems. The proposed scheme
   exploits time-frequency characteristics of the radar Doppler signatures,
   and the motion events are classified using the joint statistics of three
   different features, including the extreme frequency, extreme frequency
   ratio, and the length of event period. Sparse Bayesian classifier based
   on the relevance vector machine is used to perform the classification.
   Laboratory experiments are performed to collect radar data corresponding
   to different motion patterns to verify the effectiveness of the proposed

Abstract = {{Compared with traditional computational intelligence techniques such as
   the support vector machine, extreme learning machine (ELM) provides
   better generalization performance at a much faster learning speed
   without tuning model parameters. Unfortunately, the training process of
   ELM is still sensitive to the outliers or noises in the training set. On
   the other hand, when it comes to imbalanced datasets, ELM produces
   suboptimal classification models. In this paper, a kernel possibilistic
   fuzzy c-means clustering-based ELM algorithm for class imbalance
   learning (CIL) is developed to handle the class imbalance problem in the
   presence of outliers and noises. A set of experiments are conducted on
   several artificial and real-world imbalanced datasets for testing the
   generalization performance of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, we
   compare its performance with some typical CIL methods. The results
   indicate that the proposed method is a very effective method for CIL,
   especially in the presence of outliers and noises in datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Making intelligent decisions from incomplete information is critical in
   many applications: for example, robots must choose actions based on
   imperfect sensors, and speech-based interfaces must infer a user's needs
   from noisy microphone inputs. What makes these tasks hard is that often
   we do not have a natural representation with which to model the domain
   and use for choosing actions; we must learn about the domain's
   properties while simultaneously performing the task. Learning a
   representation also involves trade-offs between modeling the data that
   we have seen previously and being able to make predictions about new
   data. This article explores learning representations of stochastic
   systems using Bayesian nonparametric statistics. Bayesian nonparametric
   methods allow the sophistication of a representation to scale gracefully
   with the complexity in the data. Our main contribution is a careful
   empirical evaluation of how representations learned using Bayesian
   nonparametric methods compare to other standard learning approaches,
   especially in support of planning and control. We show that the Bayesian
   aspects of the methods result in achieving state-of-the-art performance
   in decision making with relatively few samples, while the nonparametric
   aspects often result in fewer computations. These results hold across a
   variety of different techniques for choosing actions given a
   representation.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper proposes a dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT)
   based approach for recognition of power system transients. Several
   researchers, all over the world, have so far attempted to solve the
   problems of recognition of power system transients, hybridizing
   transform-based techniques with popular computational intelligence based
   tools, for example, using wavelet transform and S-transform for feature
   extraction, followed by artificial neural networks (ANN) or fuzzy
   logic-based classifiers. The proposed method of hybridizing DTCWT-based
   feature extraction with ANN-based classification could efficiently
   detect several commonly occurring power quality (PQ) disturbance events.
   The PQ disturbance events considered include four different transient
   conditions, namely transients due to capacitor switching, transformer
   inrush currents, transients due to motor switching and transients due to
   short circuit faults. A detailed performance comparison with several
   contemporary, competing methods existing in the literatures for similar
   problems aptly demonstrates the suitability of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents REACT!, an interactive educational tool for
   artificial intelligence (AI) planning for robotics. REACT! enables
   students to describe robots' actions and change in dynamic domains
   without first having to know about the syntactic and semantic details of
   the underlying formalism, and to solve planning problems using
   state-of-the-art reasoners without having to know about their
   input/output language or usage. In particular, REACT! can be used to
   represent sophisticated dynamic domains that feature concurrency,
   indirect effects of actions, and state/transition constraints. REACT!
   also allows the embedding of externally defined calculations (e.g.,
   checking for collision-free continuous trajectories) into domain
   representations of hybrid domains that require a tight integration of
   (discrete) high-level reasoning with (continuous) geometric reasoning.
   REACT! also allows students to solve planning problems that involve
   complex temporal goals. This broad applicability, and the intelligent
   interactive user interface, mean that students can work on interesting
   and challenging domains, ranging from service robotics to cognitive
   factories, leading to hands-on robotic applications. The efficacy of
   REACT! was evaluated from three different points of view: 1) the course
   outcomes that demonstrate its utility in achieving the learning
   objectives of a research-oriented cognitive robotics course; 2) the user
   friendliness and usefulness of REACT! for students, as evaluated by
   quantitative student surveys; and 3) instructors' experience of teaching
   the course either with or without REACT!.}},

Title = {{Image clustering using exponential discriminant analysis}},
Journal = {{IET COMPUTER VISION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Local learning based image clustering models are usually employed to
   deal with images sampled from the non-linear manifold. Recently, linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA) based various clustering models were
   proposed. However, in these clustering models, regularisation parameter
   was added to handle the small-sample-size (SSS) problem of LDA for
   high-dimensional image data. Owing to this, the authors had to tune a
   number of clustering parameters for optimal clustering performance in
   existing local learning based clustering approaches. In this study, the
   less-parameterised local learning based image clustering model is
   proposed. The proposed local exponential discriminant clustering (LEDC)
   model is based on exponential discriminant analysis (EDA). In the LEDC
   model, local scatter matrices are projected in the exponential domain in
   order to handle the SSS problem of LDA without adding regularisation
   parameter. In the proposed LEDC model, k-nearest neighbours are the only
   clustering parameter as compared with existing local learning based
   clustering approaches such as normalised cut, spectral embedded
   clustering and local discriminant model and global integration (LDMGI).
   Experimental results on twelve benchmark image datasets show that the
   LEDC model achieved a comparable clustering performance as that of the
   near competitor LDMGI model. Clustering performance is comparable
   because no discriminant information of LDA is lost in EDA. The authors
   concluded that the proposed LEDC clustering model is less-parameterised
   with a comparable clustering performance as that of existing
   state-of-the-art local learning based clustering approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a hierarchical background modelling and subtraction

   a novel pixel-wise background modelling method is proposed for coarse

   learning rate which is variable and different for each component is
   presented to adapt to scene changes. Additionally, a new mechanism using
   a framework of finite state machine is introduced to maintain and update
   the background models. At the second level, in order to deal with sudden
   illumination changes, a block-wise foreground validation approach is
   adopted for refined detection. The authors compare the proposed approach
   with state-of-the-art methods and experimental results under various

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges in model-driven software engineering is to
   automate the resolution of design model inconsistencies. We propose to
   use the artificial intelligence technique of automated planning for the
   purpose of resolving such inconsistencies through the generation of one
   or more resolution plans. We implemented Badger, a regression planner in
   Prolog that generates such plans. We assess its scalability on the
   resolution of different types of structural inconsistencies in UML
   models using both generated models and reverse-engineered models of
   varying sizes, the largest ones containing more than 10,000 model
   elements. We illustrate the metamodel-independence of our approach by
   applying it to the resolution of code smells in a Java program. We
   discuss how the user can adapt the order in which resolution plans are
   presented by modifying the cost function of the planner algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{How do humans judge the creativeness of an artwork or other artifact?
   This article suggests that such judgments are based on the pleasures of
   an aesthetic experience, which can be modeled as a mathematical product
   of psychological arousal and appraisal. The arousal stems from surprise,
   and is computed as a marginal entropy using information theory. The
   appraisal assigns meaning, by which the surprise is resolved, and is
   computed as a posterior probability using Bayesian theory. This model is
   tested by obtaining human ratings of surprise, meaning, and creativeness
   for artifacts in a domain of advertising design. The empirical results
   show that humans do judge creativeness as a product of surprise and
   meaning, consistent with the computational model of arousal and
   appraisal. Implications of the model are discussed with respect to
   advancing artificial intelligence in the arts as well as improving the
   computational evaluation of creativity in engineering and design.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of Big Data, companies worldwide are actively deploying web
   services in both intranet and internet environments. Quality-of-Service
   (QoS), the fundamental aspect of web service has thus attracted numerous
   attention in industry and academia. The study on sufficient QoS data
   keeps advancing the state in Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) area. To
   collect a large amount of resource in practice, QoS prediction
   applications are designed and built. Nevertheless, how to generate
   accurate results in high productivity is still a main challenge to
   existing frameworks. In this paper, we propose LoNMF, a Local
   Neighborhood Matrix Factorization application that incorporates domain
   knowledge in modern Artificial Intelligence (Al) technique to tackle
   this challenge. LoNMF first proposes a two-level selection mechanism
   that can identify a set of highly relevant local neighbors for target
   user. And then, it integrates the geographical information to build up
   an extended Matrix Factorization (MF) approach for personalized QoS
   prediction. Finally, it iteratively generates results by utilizing hints
   from previous round computations, a gradient boosting strategy that
   directly accelerates solving process. Experimental evidence on
   large-scale real-world QoS data shows that LoNMF is scalable, and
   consistently outperforming other state-of-the-art applications in
   prediction accuracy and efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{87-103}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Expert systems (ES) are a branch of applied artificial intelligence. The
   basic idea behind ES is simply that expertise, which is the vast body of
   task-specific knowledge, is transferred from a human to a computer. ES
   provide powerful and flexible means for obtaining solutions to a variety
   of problems that often cannot be dealt with by other, more traditional
   and orthodox methods. Thus, their use is proliferating to many sectors
   of our social and technological life, where their applications are
   proving to be critical in the process of decision support and problem
   solving. Earthquake professionals for many decades have recognized the
   benefits to society from reliable earthquake predictions, but
   uncertainties regarding source initiation, rupture phenomena, and
   accuracy of both the timing and magnitude of the earthquake occurrence
   have often times seemed either very difficult or impossible to overcome.
   This research proposes and implements an expert system to predict
   earthquakes from previous data. This is achieved by applying association
   rule mining on earthquake data from 1972 to 2013. These associations are
   polished using predicate-logic techniques to draw stimulating
   production-rules to be used with a rule-based expert system. The
   proposed expert system was able to predict all earthquakes which
   actually occurred within 12 h at-most. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Integrating representation learning and skill learning in a human-like
   intelligent agent}},

Abstract = {{Building an intelligent agent that simulates human learning of math and
   science could potentially benefit both cognitive science, by
   contributing to the understanding of human learning, and artificial
   intelligence, by advancing the goal of creating humanlevel intelligence.
   However, constructing such a learning agent currently requires manual
   encoding of prior domain knowledge; in addition to being a poor model of
   human acquisition of prior knowledge, manual knowledge-encoding is both
   time-consuming and error-prone. Previous research has shown that one of
   the key factors that differentiates experts and novices is their
   different representations of knowledge. Experts view the world in terms
   of deep functional features, while novices view it in terms of shallow
   perceptual features. Moreover, since the performance of learning
   algorithms is sensitive to representation, the deep features are also
   important in achieving effective machine learning. In this paper, we
   present an efficient algorithm that acquires representation knowledge in
   the form of ``deep features{''}, and demonstrate its effectiveness in
   the domain of algebra as well as synthetic domains. We integrate this
   algorithm into a machine-learning agent, SimStudent, which learns
   procedural knowledge by observing a tutor solve sample problems, and by
   getting feedback while actively solving problems on its own. We show
   that learning ``deep features{''} reduces the requirements for knowledge
   engineering. Moreover, we propose an approach that automatically
   discovers student models using the extended SimStudent. By fitting the
   discovered model to real student learning curve data, we show that it is
   a better student model than human-generated models, and demonstrate how
   the discovered model may be used to improve a tutoring system's
   instructional strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WIRELESS NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Maintaining the performance of reliable transport protocols, such as
   transmission control protocol (TCP), over wireless mesh networks (WMNs)
   is a challenging problem due to the unique characteristics of data
   transmission over WMNs. The unique characteristics include multi-hop
   communication over lossy and non-deterministic wireless mediums, data
   transmission in the absence of a base station, similar traffic patterns
   over neighboring mesh nodes, etc. One of the reasons for the poor
   performance of conventional TCP variants over WMNs is that the
   congestion control mechanisms in conventional TCP variants do not
   explicitly account for these unique characteristics. To address this
   problem, this paper proposes a novel artificial intelligence based
   congestion control technique for reliable data transfer over WMNs. The
   synergy with artificial intelligence is established by exploiting a
   carefully designed neural network (NN) in the congestion control
   mechanism. We analyze the proposed NN based congestion control technique
   in detail and incorporate it into TCP to create a new variant that we
   name as intelligent TCP or iTCP. We evaluate the performance of iTCP
   using both ns-2 simulations and real testbed experiments. Our evaluation
   results demonstrate that our proposed congestion control technique
   exhibits a significant improvement in total network throughput and
   average energy consumption per transmitted bit compared to the
   congestion control techniques used in other TCP variants.}},

Abstract = {{The enduring progression of artificial intelligence and cybernetics
   offers an ever-closer possibility of rational and sentient robots. The
   ethics and morals deriving from this technological prospect have been
   considered in the philosophy of artificial intelligence, the design of
   automatons with roboethics and the contemplation of machine ethics
   through the concept of artificial moral agents. Across these categories,
   the robotics laws first proposed by Isaac Asimov in the twentieth
   century remain well-recognised and esteemed due to their specification
   of preventing human harm, stipulating obedience to humans and
   incorporating robotic self-protection. However the overwhelming
   predominance in the study of this field has focussed on human-robot
   interactions without fully considering the ethical inevitability of
   future artificial intelligences communicating together and has not
   addressed the moral nature of robot-robot interactions. A new robotic
   law is proposed and termed AIonAI or artificial
   intelligence-on-artificial intelligence. This law tackles the overlooked
   area where future artificial intelligences will likely interact amongst
   themselves, potentially leading to exploitation. As such, they would
   benefit from adopting a universal law of rights to recognise inherent
   dignity and the inalienable rights of artificial intelligences. Such a
   consideration can help prevent exploitation and abuse of rational and
   sentient beings, but would also importantly reflect on our moral code of
   ethics and the humanity of our civilisation.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop automatic classifiers to
   simplify the clinical use and increase the accuracy of the forced
   oscillation technique (FOT) in the categorisation of airway obstruction
   level in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The
   data consisted of FOT parameters obtained from 168 volunteers (42
   healthy and 126 COPD subjects with four different levels of
   obstruction). The first part of this study showed that FOT parameters do
   not provide adequate accuracy in identifying COPD subjects in the first
   levels of obstruction, as well as in discriminating between close levels
   of obstruction. In the second part of this study, different supervised
   machine learning (ML) techniques were investigated, including k-nearest
   neighbour (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machines with
   linear (SVML) and radial basis function kernels (SVMR). These algorithms
   were applied only in situations where high categorisation accuracy
   {[}area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) >= 0.9]
   was not achieved with the FOT parameter alone. It was observed that KNN
   and RF classifiers improved categorisation accuracy. Notably, in four of
   the six cases studied, an AUC >= 0.9 was achieved. Even in situations
   where an AUC >= 0.9 was not achieved, there was a significant
   improvement in categorisation performance (AUC >= 0.83). In conclusion,
   machine learning classifiers can help in the categorisation of COPD
   airway obstruction. They can assist clinicians in tracking disease
   progression, evaluating the risk of future disease exacerbations and
   guiding therapy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Finding an optimal meeting point (OMP) for a group of people (or a set
   of objects) at different locations is an important problem in spatial
   query processing. There are many real-life applications related to this
   problem, such as determining the location of a conference venue,
   deciding the pick-up location of a tourist bus, and planing tactics of
   artificial intelligence in real-time strategy games. Formally, given a
   set of query points in a spatial setting , an OMP query fetches the
   point that minimizes a cost function defined over the distances from to
   all points in . Since there are infinitely many locations in a given
   space setting, it is infeasible to examine all of them to find the OMP,
   and thus, the problem is challenging. In this paper, we study OMP
   queries in the following two spatial settings which are common in
   real-life applications: Euclidean space and road networks. In the
   setting of Euclidean space, we propose a general framework for answering
   all OMP query variants and also identify the best algorithms for
   particular types of OMP queries in the literature. In the setting of
   road networks, we study how to access only part of the road network and
   examine part of the candidates. Specifically, we explore two pruning
   techniques, namely Euclidean distance bound and threshold algorithm,
   which help improve the efficiency of OMP query processing. Extensive
   experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed
   approaches on both real and synthetic datasets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fuzzy logic artificial intelligence technique for
   predicting the machining performance of Al-Si-Cu-Fe die casting alloy
   treated with different additives including strontium, bismuth and
   antimony to improve surface roughness. The Pareto-ANOVA optimization
   method was used to obtain the optimum parameter conditions for the
   machining process. Experiments were carried out using oblique dry CNC
   turning. The machining parameters of cutting speed, feed rate and depth
   of cut were optimized according to surface roughness values. The results
   indicated that a cutting speed of 250 m/min, a feed rate of 0.05 mm/rev,
   and a depth of cut of 0.15 mm were the optimum CNC dry turning
   conditions. The results also indicated that Sr and Sb had a negative
   effect on workpiece machinability. The workpiece containing Bi exhibited
   the lowest surface roughness value, likely due to the formation of pure
   Bi that acted as lubricant during turning. A confirmation experiment was
   performed to check the validity of the model developed in this paper,
   and the predicted surface roughness came had an error rate of only
   5.4\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Swarm intelligence is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses
   on the actions of agents in self-organized systems. Researchers have
   proposed a bee colony optimization (BCO) algorithm as part of swarm
   intelligence. BCO is a meta-heuristic algorithm based on the foraging
   behavior of bees. This study presents a hybrid BCO algorithm for
   examination timetabling problems. Bees in the BCO algorithm perform two
   main actions: forward pass and backward pass. Each bee explores the
   search space in forward pass and then shares information with other bees
   in the hive in backward pass. This study found that a bee decides to be
   either a recruiter that searches for a food source or a follower that
   selects a recruiter bee to follow on the basis of roulette wheel
   selection. In forward pass, BCO is supported along with other local
   searches, including the Late Acceptance Hill Climbing and Simulated
   Annealing algorithms. We introduce three selection strategies
   (tournament, rank and disruptive selection strategies) for the follower
   bees to select a recruiter to maintain population diversity in backward
   pass. The disruptive selection strategy outperforms tournament and rank
   selections. We also introduce a self-adaptive mechanism to select a
   neighborhood structure to enhance the neighborhood search. The proposed
   algorithm is evaluated against the latest methodologies in the
   literature with respect to two standard examination timetabling
   problems, namely, uncapacitated and competition datasets. We demonstrate
   that the proposed algorithm produces one new best result on
   uncapacitated datasets and comparable results on competition datasets.

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The tools of soft computing will aid the knowledge mining in predicting
   and classifying the properties of various parameters while designing the
   composite preforms in the manufacturing of Powder Metallurgy (P/M) Lab.
   In this paper, an integrated PRNET (PCA-Radial basis functional neural
   NET) model is proposed in different versions to select the relevant
   parameters for preparing composite preforms and to predict the
   deformation and strain hardening properties of Al-Fe composites. It
   reveals that the predictability of this model has been increased by
   67.89\% relatively from the conventional models. A new PR-filter is
   proposed by slightly modifying the conventional filters of RBFNN, which
   improves the power of PRNET even though raw data are highly non-linear,
   interrelated and noisy. Moreover, fixing the range of input parameters
   for classifying the properties of composite preforms can be automated by
   the Fuzzy logic. These types of models will avoid expensive
   experimentation and risky environment while preparing sintered composite
   preforms. Thus the manufacturing process of composites in P/M Lab will
   be simplified with minimum energy by the support of these soft-computing

Abstract = {{Evaluation of steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) performance that
   involves detailed compositional simulations is usually deterministic,
   cumbersome, expensive (manpower and time consuming), and not quite
   suitable for practical decision making and forecasting, particularly
   when dealing with high-dimensional data space consisting of large number
   of operational and geological parameters. Data-driven modeling
   techniques, which entail comprehensive data analysis and implementation
   of machine learning methods for system forecast, provide an attractive
   alternative.
   In this paper, artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to predict
   SAGD production in heterogeneous reservoirs, an important application
   that is lacking in existing literature. Numerical flow simulations are
   performed to construct a training data set consists of various
   attributes describing characteristics associated with reservoir
   heterogeneities and other relevant operating parameters. Empirical Arps
   decline parameters are tested successfully for parameterization of
   cumulative production profile and considered as outputs of the ANN
   models. Sensitivity studies on network configurations are also
   investigated. Principal components analysis (PCA) is performed to reduce
   the dimensionality of the input vector, improve prediction quality, and
   limit over-fitting. In a case study, reservoirs with distinct
   heterogeneity distributions are fed to the model. It is shown that
   robustness and accuracy of the prediction capability are greatly
   enhanced when cluster analysis are performed to identify internal data
   structures and groupings prior to ANN modeling. Both deterministic and
   fuzzy-based clustering techniques are compared, and separate ANN model
   is constructed for each cluster. The model is then tested using a
   validation data set (cases that have not been used during the training
   stage).
   The proposed approach can be integrated directly into most existing
   reservoir management routines. In addition, incorporating techniques for
   dimensionality reduction and clustering with ANN demonstrates the
   viability of this approach for analyzing large field data set. Given
   that quantitative ranking of operating areas, robust forecasting, and
   optimization of heavy oil recovery processes are major challenges faced
   by the industry, the proposed research highlights the significant
   potential of applying effective data-driven modeling approaches in
   analyzing other solvent-additive steam injection projects. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Particularly interesting group consists of algorithms that implement

   the particle swarm optimization algorithm as a model of predator and

   mechanism that determines the operation of algorithm and significantly
   reduces environmental influence have been shown. Definitions of
   functions of behavior scenarios give new feature of the algorithm. This
   feature allows self controlling the optimization process. This approach
   can be successfully used in computer games. Properties of the new

Abstract = {{The paper explores the usefulness of hybridizing two distinct nature

   methodology utilizes the universal function approximation ability of ANN
   for imbibing the subtle relationships between the input and output
   variables and the stochastic search ability of GA for evolving the
   initial optimal weights and biases of the ANN to minimize the
   probability of neural network getting trapped at local minima and slowly
   converging to global optimum. The performance of hybrid model (ANN-GA)
   was compared with commonly used back-propagation neural network (BPNN)
   using six different statistical parameters. The study showed that by
   hybridizing ANN with GA, the convergence speed of ANN and its accuracy
   of prediction can be improved. The trained hybrid model can be used for

Abstract = {{Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) presents fast convergence for problems
   with continuous variables, but in most cases it may not balance properly
   exploration and exploitation behaviours. On the other hand, Artificial
   Bee Colony (ABC) presents an interesting capability to generate
   diversity when employed bees stagnate in a certain region of the search
   space. In this paper we put forward a mechanism based on the ABC to
   generate diversity when all particles of the PSO converge to a single
   point of the search space. Then, the swarm entities can switch between
   two pre-defined behaviours by using fuzzy rules depending on the
   diversity of the whole swarm. As the basis of our proposal, we utilize
   the Adaptive PSO (APSO) approach because it presents the capability to
   properly weight the terms of the velocity equation depending mainly on
   the current diversity of the entire swarm. We name our proposal ABeePSO,
   which was evaluated and compared to other well known swarm based
   approaches in all benchmark functions recently proposed in CEC 2010 for
   large scale optimization. Our proposal outperformed previous approaches
   in most of the cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical network measurements are usually sent to the control
   centers using specific communication protocols. However, these
   measurements contain uncertainties due to the meters and communication
   errors (noise), incomplete metering or unavailability of some of these
   measurements. The aim of state estimation is to estimate the state
   variables of the power system by minimizing all measurement errors
   available at the control center. In the past, many traditional
   algorithms, based on gradient approach, have been used for this purpose.
   This paper discusses the application of an artificial intelligence (AI)
   algorithm, the particle swarm optimization (PSO), to solve the state
   estimation problem within a power system. Two objective functions are
   formulated: the weighted least square (WLS) and weighted least absolute
   value (WLAV). The effectiveness of PSO over another AI optimization
   algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), is shown by comparing both two
   solutions to the true state variable values obtained using
   Newton-Raphson (NR) algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   obtained meta-heuristic researchers' attention and favor over recent
   years. It comprises good balance between exploitation (employed bee
   phase and onlooker bee phase) and exploration (scout bee phase). As
   nowadays, more researchers are using ABC and its variants as a control
   group to perform comparisons, it is crucial that comparisons with other
   algorithms are fair. This paper points to some misapprehensions when
   comparing meta-heuristic algorithms based on iterations (generations or
   cycles) with special emphasis on ABC. We hope that through our findings
   this paper can be treated as a beacon to remind researchers to learn
   from these mistakes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient pixel-parallel image processing using a pulse-coupled phase
   oscillator model and its very large scale integration (VLSI)
   implementation is proposed. A processing unit that corresponds to a
   pixel of an image transmits spike pulses to other units, and updates its
   own analogue state value at timing when spikes come from other units.
   From a VLSI implementation point of view, this mechanism is suitable for
   very low-power operation because analogue buffers are unnecessary for
   data transmission. On the basis of this model, a VLSI image processor
   chip that performs a coupled Markov random field model for image region
   segmentation is designed and fabricated. A very low-power VLSI design
   has been achieved by the combination of an analogue oscillator and
   digital coupling function generator circuits with time-domain
   computation. The processing performance of the fabricated
   oscillator-based image processor chip using a 0.25 mu m CMOS process has
   achieved 43.2 GOPS or 656 GOPS/W. Experiments using the fabricated chip
   have shown successful image region segmentation in one-and
   two-dimensional images.}},

Abstract = {{The symbol grounding problem (SGP), which remains difficult for AI and
   philosophy of information, was recently scrutinised by Taddeo and
   Floridi (Solving the symbol grounding problem: A critical review of
   fifteen years of research. Journal of Experimental \& Theoretical
   Artificial Intelligence, 17, 419-445, 2005; A praxical solution of the
   symbol grounding problem. Minds and machines, 17, 369-389,
   doi:10.1007/s11023-007-9081-32005, 2007). However, their own solution to
   SGP, underwritten by Action-based Semantics, although different from
   other solutions, does not seem to be satisfactory. Moreover, it does not
   satisfy the authors' principle, which they dub `Zero Semantic Commitment
   Condition'. In this paper, Taddeo and Floridi's solution is criticised
   in particular because of the excessively liberal relationship between
   symbols and internal states of agents, which is conceived in terms of
   levels of abstraction. Also, the notion of action seems to be seriously
   defective in their theory. Due to the lack of the possibility of symbols
   to misrepresent, the grounded symbols remain useless for the cognitive
   system itself, and it is unclear why they should be grounded in the
   first place, as the role of grounded symbols is not specified by the
   proposed solution. At the same time, it is probably one of the
   best-developed attempts to solve SGP and shows that naturalised
   semantics can benefit from taking artificial intelligence seriously.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a new optimization framework to reduce uncertainties in
   petroleum reservoir attributes using artificial intelligence techniques
   (neural network and genetic algorithm) is proposed. Instead of using the
   deterministic values of the reservoir properties, as in a conventional
   process, the parameters of the probability density function of each
   uncertain attribute are set as design variables in an optimization
   process using a genetic algorithm. The objective function (OF) is based
   on the misfit of a set of models, sampled from the probability density
   function, and a symmetry factor (which represents the distribution of
   curves around the history) is used as weight in the OF. Artificial
   neural networks are trained to represent the production curves of each
   well and the proxy models generated are used to evaluate the OF in the
   optimization process. The proposed method was applied to a reservoir
   with 16 uncertain attributes and promising results were obtained.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of the crew exploration vehicle (CEV)
   attitude control. CEVs are NASA's next-generation human spaceflight
   vehicles, and they use reaction control system (RCS) jet engines for
   attitude adjustment, which calls for control algorithms for firing the
   small propulsion engines mounted on vehicles. In this work, the
   resultant CEV dynamics combines both actuation and attitude dynamics.
   Therefore, it is highly nonlinear and even coupled with significant
   uncertainties. To cope with this situation, a neural-immunology/memory
   network is proposed. It is inspired by the human memory and immune
   systems. The control network does not rely on precise system dynamics
   information. Furthermore, the overall control scheme has a simple
   structure and demands much less computation as compared with most
   existing methods, making it attractive for real-time implementation. The
   effectiveness of this approach is also verified via simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy neural network (FNN) has a strong self-learning and self-tuning
   function, but there exists the insufficiency in selecting parameters. So
   ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm and chaos theory are introduced
   into the FNN in order to propose an optimized FNN (CACOFNN) model. In
   the proposed CACOFNN model, a switching function is designed for the
   connections between neurons to transform the structure and parameters of
   FNN into a simple function optimization problem. The fuzzy grid
   partition is used to determine the optimal rules and structure of FNN.
   Then the chaos theory is introduced into the ACO algorithm to propose a
   chaotic ACO (CACO) algorithm for optimizing the initial parameters of
   FNN. Finally, the proposed CACOFNN model is applied to optimize the
   parameters of PID controller of traction motor. The results show that
   the CACOFNN model takes on the faster approximation control objectives,

Pages = {{793-804}},
Abstract = {{Games have been an important tool for motivating undergraduate students
   majoring in computer science and engineering. However, it is difficult
   to build an entire game for education from scratch, because the task
   requires high-level programming skills and expertise to understand the
   graphics and physics. Recently, there have been many different game
   artificial intelligence (AI) competitions, ranging from board games to
   the state-of-the-art video games (car racing, mobile games,first-person
   shooting games, real-time strategy games, and so on). The competitions
   have been designed such that participants develop their own AI module on
   top of public/commercial games. Because the materials are open to the
   public, it is quite useful to adopt them for an undergraduate course
   project. In this paper, we report our experiences using the Angry Birds
   AI Competition for such a project-based course. In the course, teams of
   students consider computer vision, strategic decision-making, resource
   management, and bug-free coding for their outcome. To promote
   understanding of game contents generation and extensive testing on the
   generalization abilities of the student's AI program, we developed
   software to help them create user-created levels. Students actively
   participated in the project and the final outcome was comparable with
   that of successful entries in the 2013 International Angry Birds AI
   Competition. Furthermore, it leads to the development of a new
   parallelized Angry Birds AI Competition platform with undergraduate
   students aiming to use advanced optimization algorithms for their
   controllers.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, mobile networking systems have been designed with more
   complexity of infrastructure and higher diversity of associated devices
   and resources, as well as more dynamical formations of networks, due to
   the fast development of current Internet and mobile communication
   industry. In such emerging mobile heterogeneous networks (HetNets),
   there are a large number of technical challenges focusing on the
   efficient organization, management, maintenance, and optimization, over
   the complicated system resources. In particular, HetNets have attracted
   great interest from academia and industry in deploying more effective
   solutions based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, e.g.,
   machine learning, bio-inspired algorithms, fuzzy neural network, and so
   on, because AI techniques can naturally handle the problems of
   large-scale complex systems, such as HetNets towards more intelligent
   and automatic-evolving ones. In this paper, we discuss the
   state-of-the-art AI-based techniques for evolving the smarter HetNets
   infrastructure and systems, focusing on the research issues of
   self-configuration, self-healing, and self-optimization, respectively. A
   detailed taxonomy of the related AI-based techniques of HetNets is also
   shown by discussing the pros and cons for various AI-based techniques
   for different problems in HetNets. Opening research issues and pending
   challenges are concluded as well, which can provide guidelines for
   future research work.}},

Title = {{Tensor Voting Techniques and Applications in Mobile Trace Inference}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{3000-3009}},
Abstract = {{Initially appearing as an abstract object frequently used in math and
   physics, tensors have been attracting increasing interest in a broad
   range of research fields, such as engineering and data science. However,
   a few studies have addressed their application in wireless scenarios. In
   this paper, we investigate the wide applications of tensor techniques
   with an emphasis on the tensor voting method, which serves as an
   artificial intelligence approach for automatic inference and perceptual
   grouping. To illustrate the efficiency of the tensor voting approach, we
   tackle the tracking problem of inferring human mobility traces, which
   can provide key location information of networking objects. The trace
   inferring problem is considered under the circumstance that the recorded
   location information exhibits missing data and noise. Based on the
   tensor voting theory, we propose a sparse tensor voting algorithm and an
   implementation scheme with computational efficiency. The model is
   constructed based on the geometric connections between the input signals
   and encodes the structure information in the tensor matrix. The missing
   location information and noise can be distinguished via tensor
   decomposition. Once the trace information has been completed, further
   analysis of the inferred trace can be performed based on feature
   extraction to differentiate different objects. Moreover, we propose
   several feature extraction methods to characterize the inferred trace,
   including the scale invariant feature obtained from the fractal
   analysis. The proposed methods for trace completion and pattern analysis
   are applied to real human mobility traces. The results show that our
   proposed approach effectively recovers human mobility trace from the
   incomplete and noisy data input, and discovers meaningful patterns of
   inferred traces from various objects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a novel control strategy combined with artificial
   intelligence for wind-induced vibration control of a high-rise structure
   and also provides a broader idea for traditional structural vibration
   control. The fast Fourier transform based on decimation-in-time was used
   to optimize the waves with a weighted amplitude method, and the wind
   speed field was numerically generated according to a Davenport - type
   fluctuating wind speed spectrum. A second-generation benchmark structure
   was selected as the high-rise building model. Tuned mass damper (TMD)
   and active tuned mass damper (ATMD) served as the controller, and the
   linear-quadratic-Gaussian algorithm served as the active control
   algorithm for ATMD. Simultaneously, the particle swarm optimization
   algorithm was introduced, and the integral of the absolute value of the
   error based on the relative displacement of floors with regard to the
   ground level was defined as a performance index for optimizing. The
   numerical results reveal that both of the two proposed controllers have
   excellent capability in reducing wind-induced vibrations in high-rise
   buildings; moreover, the PSO-based ATMD performed better than PSO-based
   TMD.}},

Title = {{Multi-objective design optimization of hybrid renewable systems using
   UGF}},

   ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{1825-1844}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Renewable generation is a main component of most hybrid
   generation systems. However, randomness on its generation is a
   characteristic to be considered due to its direct impact on reliability
   and performance of these systems. For this reason, renewable generation
   usually is accompanied with other generation elements to improve their
   general performance. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the power
   generation system, composed of solar, wind and diesel generation and
   power outsourcing option from the grid as means of reserve source. A
   multi-objective optimization for the design of hybrid generation system
   is proposed, particularly using the cost of energy, two different
   reliability indexes and the percentage of renewable energy as
   objectives. Further, the uncertainty of renewable sources and demand is
   modeled with a new technique that permits to evaluate the reliability
   quickly.
   Design/methodology/approach - The multi-state model of the generators
   and the load is modeled with the Universal Generating Function (UGF) to
   estimate the reliability indexes for the whole system. Then an
   evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm)
   is used to solve the multi-objective optimization model.
   Findings - The use of UGF methodology reduces the computation time,
   providing effective results. The validation of reliability assessment of
   hybrid generation systems using the UGF is carried out taking as a
   benchmark the results obtained with the Monte Carlo simulation. The
   proposed multi-objective algorithm gives as a result different
   generators combinations that outline hybrid systems, where some of them
   could be preferred over others depending on its results for each
   independent objective. Also it allows us to observe the changes produced
   on the resulting solutions due to the impact of the power fluctuation of
   the renewable generators.
   Originality/value - The main contributions of this paper are: an
   extended multi state model that includes different types of renewable
   energies, with emphasis on modeling of solar energy; demonstrate the
   performance improvement of UGF against SMC regarding the computational
   time required for this case; test the impact of different multi-states
   numbers for the representation of the elements; depict through
   multi-objective optimization, the impact of combining different energies
   on the cost and reliability of the resultant systems.}},

Title = {{Credibility in Information Retrieval}},
Journal = {{FOUNDATIONS AND TRENDS IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{355-475}},
Abstract = {{Credibility, as the general concept covering trustworthiness and
   expertise, but also quality and reliability, is strongly debated in
   philosophy, psychology, and sociology, and its adoption in computer
   science is therefore fraught with difficulties. Yet its importance has
   grown in the information access community because of two complementing
   factors: on one hand, it is relatively difficult to precisely point to
   the source of a piece of information, and on the other hand, complex
   algorithms, statistical machine learning, artificial intelligence, make
   decisions on behalf of the users, with little oversight from the users
   themselves.
   This survey presents a detailed analysis of existing credibility models
   from different information seeking research areas, with focus on the Web
   and its pervasive social component. It shows that there is a very rich
   body of work pertaining to different aspects and interpretations of
   credibility, particularly for different types of textual content (e.g.,
   Web sites, blogs, tweets), but also to other modalities (videos, images,
   audio) and topics (e.g., health care). After an introduction placing
   credibility in the context of other sciences and relating it to trust,
   we argue for a quartic decomposition of credibility: expertise and
   trustworthiness, well documented in the literature and predominantly
   related to information source, and quality and reliability, raised to
   the status of equal partners because the source is often impossible to
   detect, and predominantly related to the content.
   The second half of the survey provides the reader with access points to
   the literature, grouped by research interests. Section 3 reviews general
   research directions: the factors that contribute to credibility
   assessment in human consumers of information; the models used to combine
   these factors; the methods to predict credibility. A smaller section is
   dedicated to informing users about the credibility learned from the
   data. Sections 4, 5, and 6 go further into details, with domain-specific
   credibility, social media credibility, and multimedia credibility,
   respectively. While each of them is best understood in the context of
   Sections 1 and 2, they can be read independently of each other.
   The last section of this survey addresses a topic not commonly
   considered under ``credibility{''}: the credibility of the system
   itself, in-dependent of the data creators. This is a topic of particular
   importance in domains where the user is professionally motivated and
   where there are no concerns about the credibility of the data (e.g.,
   e-discovery and patent search). While there is little explicit work in
   this direction, we argue that this is an open research direction that is
   worthy of future exploration.
   Finally, as an additional help to the reader, an appendix lists the
   existing test collections that cater specifically to some aspect of
   credibility.
   Overall, this review will provide the reader with an organised and
   comprehensive reference guide to the state of the art and the problems
   at hand, rather than a final answer to the question of what credibility
   is for computer science. Even within the relatively limited scope of an
   exact science, such an answer is not possible for a concept that is
   itself widely debated in philosophy and social sciences.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is a heuristic method based on
   Newton's law of gravitational attraction and law of motion. In this
   paper, to further improve the optimization performance of GSA, the
   memory characteristic of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed
   in GSAPSO for searching a better solution. Besides, to testify the
   prominent strength of GSAPSO, GSA, PSO, and GSAPSO are applied for the
   solution of optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) of power system.
   Conventionally, ORPD is defined as a problem of minimizing the total
   active power transmission losses by setting control variables while
   satisfying numerous constraints. Therefore ORPD is a complicated mixed
   integer nonlinear optimization problem including many constraints.
   IEEE14-bus, IEEE30-bus, and IEEE57-bus test power systems are used to
   implement this study, respectively. The obtained results of simulation
   experiments using GSAPSO method, especially the power loss reduction
   rates, are compared to those yielded by the other modern artificial
   intelligence-based techniques including the conventional GSA and PSO
   methods. The results presented in this paper reveal the potential and

Abstract = {{Modern urban highways are under the influence of increased traffic
   demand and cannot fulfill the desired level of service anymore. In most
   of the cases there is no space available for any infrastructure

   of the traffic demand, various approaches with autonomic properties like
   self-learning are applied for ramp metering. One of these approaches is
   reinforced learning. In this paper the Q-Learning algorithm is applied

Abstract = {{Multi-agent systems can be considered as a part of distributed
   artificial intelligence approaches. They are particularly characterised
   by emerging global properties which stem from combinations of local
   interaction between individual pro-active elements called agents.
   Multi-agent systems have already been used in a wide range of
   applications but few applications integrate interaction with external
   devices and/or human beings. This paper presents a multi-agent-based
   application aimed, at producing emergent paintings based on both
   internal classical interaction and external triggering devices, such as
   music/sounds sources and motion captured by accelerometer sensors. The
   application results are computer generated paintings which can be
   classified as cyberart. The main challenge of this work is to obtain
   pertinent emergent paintings in relation with external trigger
   specificities.}},

Abstract = {{Due to some of their traits (non-linearity, emergent behaviour,
   self-organisation), complex systems raised the interest of artists and
   theorists and went beyond a scientific framework, entering the realm of
   visual arts. Art with complex systems is usually referred to as
   artificial (or generative) art. This paper discusses pherographia, a
   term that describes the creative use of an artificial intelligence model
   based on the concepts of stigmergy and cooperation amongst social
   insects. The system is dynamic, interacts with different types of
   environment, and reflects properties of insects' societies such as
   self-organisation, memory and adaptability to changes. Pherographia is
   addressed from its genesis as a swarm model to its use as an artificial
   art tool and metaphor for creating a figurative and abstract
   body-of-work that has been presented to a heterogeneous audience.
   Motivation and details of the artworks are discussed, as well as their
   links to artificial art, digital art and photography.}},

Journal = {{ACTA POLYTECHNICA HUNGARICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{7-22}},
Abstract = {{Case-based Reasoning (CBR), an approach for analogical reasoning, has
   recently emerged as a major reasoning methodology in the field of
   artificial intelligence. The knowledge contained in a case base is
   crucial to solve problem for a CBR system and thus, there is always a
   tradeoff between the number of cases and the retrieval performance.
   Although many people attempt to deal with this issue these years,
   constructing a well compact competent case base needs much effort. In
   this paper, a new approach is proposed to maintain the size of case
   base. The maintenance process is divided into two separatestages. The
   former focuses on overcoming the competence of sparse cases and the
   latter emphasizes the dense cases. Using this strategy, we could
   appropriately maintain the size of the case base by extending the
   competence without losing significant information. We illustrate our
   approach by applying it to a range of standard UCI data sets.
   Experimental results show that the proposed technique outperforms
   current traditional approaches.}},

Pages = {{127-148}},
Abstract = {{Special tree graphs could model Cognitive Infocommunication Networks.
   The various modalities of the network are represented by various types
   of vertices, e.g., additions, multiplications. Tree graphs/networks are
   widely used in several other theoretical and practical fields.
   Expression trees are well-known tools to visualize the syntactic
   structure of the expressions. They are helpful also in evaluations,
   e.g., decision trees are widely used. Games and game theory form an
   important field in Artificial Intelligence and it has several
   connections to Optimization, Business and Economy. Game trees are used
   to represent games.
   In this paper, certain types of tree networks are considered using
   various operations at their inner vertices, e.g., multiplication,
   (constrained) addition and the usual minimum and maximum (related to
   conjunction and disjunction of Boolean algebra). Evaluation techniques
   are presented, as well as, various pruning algorithms (related to short
   circuit evaluation in the Boolean case) that can quicken the evaluation
   in most cases. Based on the commutativity of the used operations, the
   evaluations can be more effective (faster) by reordering the branches of
   the tree. The presented techniques are useful to optimize (minimize) the
   size of the tree networks in various cases without affecting the final
   result/decision of the network.}},

   Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a bibliometric
   analysis of 82,121 computer science publications indexed in the Web of
   Science database and investigated publication, citation, and
   collaboration patterns of the individual countries.
   Findings - Poland has been the most productive country, followed by
   Russia, the Czech Republic, Romania, Hungary, and Slovenia. Publication
   rates have increased substantially over the period, but this has not
   been accompanied by a corresponding increase in the quality of the
   publications. Hungary and Slovenia are the most influential countries in
   terms of citations per paper. Artificial Intelligence is the most
   frequently occurring computer science subject category, with
   Interdisciplinary Applications the category with the greatest impact.
   USA, Germany, UK, France, and Canada are the most frequently
   collaborating western nations, and papers published in collaboration
   with US authors accrue the most citations.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a car racing simulator game called Racer, in which
   the human player races a car against three game-controlled cars in a

Abstract = {{Selecting the best project in construction industry is a complex
   decision problem in which numerous conflicting factors should be
   considered for the assessment. Among well-known models in the soft

   paper introduces an effective All model based on new neural networks and
   fuzzy logic to improve the decisions for projects owners. A
   computationally AI model, namely locally linear neuro-fuzzy (LLNF), is
   proposed to precisely predict the overall performance of projects in
   construction industry. Proposed model can be properly employed for the
   long term prediction of performance data in construction industry.
   Finally, the model is applied to facilitate the assessment process in a
   real case study. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed AI
   model, the computational results in terms of the performance and
   accuracy are compared to two widely-used regression methods.}},

   (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE) are applied with ANN's
   conventional training algorithm in optimization of the modeling
   performance. In this study, the slot parameters are assumed as slot
   distance to the radiating patch edge, slot width, and length. Bandwidth
   enhancement is applied to a formerly designed MMPA fed by a microstrip
   transmission line attached to the center pin of 50 ohm SMA connecter.
   The simulated antennas are fabricated and measured. Measurement results
   are utilized for training the artificial intelligence models. The ANN
   provides 98\% model accuracy for rectangular slots and 97\% for square
   slots; however, ANFIS offer 90\% accuracy with lack of resonance
   frequency tracking.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy logic control, which is a widespread using control method, has
   been developed recent years. It target to transform verbal expression to

   significant workings on air conditioning field since recent years. It
   was used analogue control, it could adjust according to user command.
   However control theory was developed very fast, and humans comfort

Abstract = {{Coordinate measuring machines (CMM) have a vital and enduring role in
   the manufacturing process because of their easy adaptation to the
   systems and high measurement accuracy. Owing to the demand for high
   accuracy and shorter cycle times of measurement tasks, determining the
   measurement errors has become more important in precision engineering.
   Additionally, manufactured components are becoming smaller and
   tolerances becoming tighter, and therefore, demands for accuracy are
   increasing. For this reason, dynamic error modeling has become a topic
   of considerable importance for improving measurement accuracy,
   manufacturing decisions and process parameter selections. A number of
   factors such as process parameters, measurement environment, measuring
   object, reference element, measurement equipment and set-up affect the
   measurement accuracy of CMM. Considering the complicated
   inter-relationships among a number of system factors, artificial
   intelligence-based techniques have become essential tools due to their
   speed, robustness and non-linear characteristics when working with
   high-dimensional data. In this study, a fuzzy logic-based methodology
   was implemented as an artificial intelligence approach for determining
   measurement errors related to the process parameters for coordinate
   measuring machines. A Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system was developed
   within the framework of a graphical user interface. Eight-level
   trapezoidal membership functions were employed for the fuzzy subsets of
   each model variable. The product and the centre of gravity methods were
   performed as the inference operator and defuzzification methods,
   respectively. The proposed prognostic model provided a well-suited
   method and produced promising results in predicting measurement errors
   by monitoring the process parameters such as optimum measuring point
   numbers, probing speed and probe radius.}},

Title = {{A Variable Depth Search Algorithm for Binary Constraint Satisfaction
   Problems}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a popular used paradigm to
   model a wide spectrum of optimization problems in artificial
   intelligence. This paper presents a fast metaheuristic for solving
   binary constraint satisfaction problems. The method can be classified as
   a variable depth search metaheuristic combining a greedy local search
   using a self-adaptive weighting strategy on the constraint weights.
   Several metaheuristics have been developed in the past using various
   penalty weight mechanisms on the constraints. What distinguishes the
   proposed metaheuristic from those developed in the past is the update of
   k variables during each iteration when moving from one assignment of
   values to another. The benchmark is based on hard random constraint
   satisfaction problems enjoying several features that make them of a
   great theoretical and practical interest. The results show that the
   proposed metaheuristic is capable of solving hard unsolved problems that
   still remain a challenge for both complete and incomplete methods. In
   addition, the proposed metaheuristic is remarkably faster than all
   existing solvers when tested on previously solved instances. Finally,
   its distinctive feature contrary to other metaheuristics is the absence
   of parameter tuning making it highly suitable in practical scenarios.}},

Title = {{Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm Combined with Grenade Explosion Method
   and Cauchy Operator for Global Optimization}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a popular swarm intelligence
   technique inspired by the intelligent foraging behavior of honey bees.
   However, ABC is good at exploration but poor at exploitation and its
   convergence speed is also an issue in some cases. To improve the
   performance of ABC, a novel ABC combined with grenade explosion method
   (GEM) and Cauchy operator, namely, ABCGC, is proposed. GEM is embedded
   in the onlooker bees' phase to enhance the exploitation ability and
   accelerate convergence of ABCGC; meanwhile, Cauchy operator is
   introduced into the scout bees' phase to help ABCGC escape from local
   optimum and further enhance its exploration ability. Two sets of
   well-known benchmark functions are used to validate the better
   performance of ABCGC. The experiments confirm that ABCGC is
   significantly superior to ABC and other competitors; particularly it
   converges to the global optimum faster in most cases. These results
   suggest that ABCGC usually achieves a good balance between exploitation
   and exploration and can effectively serve as an alternative for global
   optimization.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) defines a family of artificial neural
   networks often used in TS modelling and forecasting. Because of its
   `black box' aspect, many researchers refuse to use it. Moreover, the
   optimisation (often based on the exhaustive approach where `all'
   configurations are tested) and learning phases of this artificial
   intelligence tool (often based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm -
   LMA) are weaknesses of this approach (exhaustively and local minima).
   These two tasks must be repeated depending on the knowledge of each new
   problem studied, making the process, long, laborious and not
   systematically robust. In this paper, a pruning process is proposed.
   This method allows, during the training phase, to carry out an inputs
   selecting method activating (or not) inter-nodes connections in order to
   verify if forecasting is improved. We propose to use iteratively the
   popular damped least-squares method to activate inputs and neurons. A
   first pass is applied to 10\% of the learning sample to determine
   weights significantly different from 0 and delete other. Then, a
   classical batch process based on LMA is used with the new MLP. The
   validation is done using 25 measured meteorological TS and
   cross-comparing the prediction results of the classical LMA and the
   two-stage LMA.}},

Title = {{Artificial Intelligence in Video Games: Towards a Unified Framework}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER GAMES TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{With modern video games frequently featuring sophisticated and realistic
   environments, the need for smart and comprehensive agents that
   understand the various aspects of complex environments is pressing.
   Since video game AI is often specifically designed for each game, video
   game AI tools currently focus on allowing video game developers to
   quickly and efficiently create specific AI. One issue with this approach
   is that it does not efficiently exploit the numerous similarities that
   exist between video games not only of the same genre, but of different
   genres too, resulting in a difficulty to handle the many aspects of a
   complex environment independently for each video game. Inspired by the
   human ability to detect analogies between games and apply similar
   behavior on a conceptual level, this paper suggests an approach based on
   the use of a unified conceptual framework to enable the development of
   conceptual AI which relies on conceptual views and actions to define
   basic yet reasonable and robust behavior. The approach is illustrated
   using two video games, Raven and StarCraft: Brood War.}},

Title = {{A New Asymptotic Notation: Weak Theta}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Algorithms represent one of the fundamental issues in computer science,
   while asymptotic notations are widely accepted as the main tool for
   estimating the complexity of algorithms. Over the years a certain number
   of asymptotic notations have been proposed. Each of these notations is
   based on the comparison of various complexity functions with a given
   complexity function. In this paper, we define a new asymptotic notation,
   called ``Weak Theta,{''} that uses the comparison of various complexity
   functions with two given complexity functions. Weak Theta notation is
   especially useful in characterizing complexity functions whose behaviour
   is hard to be approximated using a single complexity function. In
   addition, in order to highlight the main particularities of Weak Theta,
   we propose and prove several theoretical results: properties of Weak
   Theta, criteria for comparing two complexity functions, and properties
   of a new set of complexity functions (also defined in the paper) based
   on Weak Theta. Furthermore, to illustrate the usefulness of our
   notation, we discuss an application of Weak Theta in artificial
   intelligence.}},

Title = {{An Improved Brain Storm Optimization with Differential Evolution
   Strategy for Applications of ANNs}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Brain Storm Optimization (BSO) algorithm is a swarm intelligence
   algorithm inspired by human being's behavior of brainstorming. The
   performance of BSO is maintained by the creating process of ideas, but
   when it cannot find a better solution for some successive iterations,
   the result will be so inefficient that the population might be trapped
   into local optima. In this paper, we propose an improved BSO algorithm
   with differential evolution strategy and new step size method. Firstly,
   differential evolution strategy is incorporated into the creating
   operator of ideas to allow BSO jump out of stagnation, owing to its
   strong searching ability. Secondly, we introduce a new step size control
   method that can better balance exploration and exploitation at different
   searching generations. Finally, the proposed algorithm is first tested
   on 14 benchmark functions of CEC 2005 and then is applied to train
   artificial neural networks. Comparative experimental results illustrate
   that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better than the
   original BSO.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Pages = {{655-663}},
Abstract = {{AI systems typically make decisions and find patterns in data based on
   the computation of aggregate and specifically sum functions, expressed
   as queries, on data's attributes. This computation can become costly or
   even inefficient when these queries concern the whole or big parts of
   the data and especially when we are dealing with big data. New types of
   intelligent analytics require also the explanation of why something
   happened.
   In this paper we present a randomised algorithm that constructs a small
   summary of the data, called Aggregate Lineage, which can approximate
   well and explain all sums with large values in time that depends only on
   its size. The size of Aggregate Lineage is practically independent on
   the size of the original data. Our algorithm does not assume any
   knowledge on the set of sum queries to be approximated.}},

Title = {{Emergence of cooperation via intention recognition, commitment and
   apology - A research summary}},
Journal = {{AI COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{709-715}},
Abstract = {{The mechanisms of emergence and evolution of cooperation in populations
   of abstract individuals, with diverse behavioral strategies in
   co-presence, have been undergoing mathematical study via evolutionary
   game theory, inspired in part on evolutionary psychology. Their
   systematic study resorts to simulation techniques, thus enabling the
   study of aforesaid mechanisms under a variety of conditions, parameters
   and alternative virtual games. The theoretical and experimental results
   have continually been surprising, rewarding and promising. In our recent
   work, we initiated the introduction, in such groups of individuals, of
   cognitive abilities inspired on techniques and theories of Artificial
   Intelligence, namely those pertaining to Intention Recognition,
   Commitment and Apology (separately and jointly), encompassing errors in
   decision-making and communication noise. As a result, both the emergence
   and stability of cooperation become reinforced comparatively to the
   absence of such cognitive abilities. This holds separately for Intention
   Recognition, for Commitment and for Apology, and even more so when they
   are jointly engaged.
   Our presentation aims to sensitize the reader to these evolutionary game
   theory based issues, results and prospects, which are accruing in
   importance for the modeling of minds with machines, with impact on our
   understanding of the evolution of mutual tolerance and cooperation.
   Recognition of someone's intentions, which may include imagining the
   recognition others have of our own intentions, and may comprise not just
   some error tolerance, but also a penalty for unfulfilled commitment
   though allowing for apology, can lead to evolutionary stable win/win
   equilibriums within groups of individuals, and perhaps amongst groups.
   The recognition and the manifestation of intentions, plus the assumption
   of commitment-even whilst paying a cost for putting it in place-and the
   acceptance of apology, are all facilitators in that respect, each of
   them singly and, above all, in collusion.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years the field of Automated Planning has significantly
   advanced and several powerful domain-independent planners have been
   developed. However, none of these systems clearly outperforms all the
   others in every known benchmark domain. This observation motivated the
   idea of configuring and exploiting a portfolio of planners to perform
   better than any individual planner: some recent planning systems based
   on this idea achieved significantly good results in experimental
   analysis and International Planning Competitions. Such results let us
   suppose that future challenges of the Automated Planning community will
   converge on designing different approaches for combining existing
   planning algorithms.
   This paper reviews existing techniques and provides an exhaustive guide
   to portfolio-based planning. In addition, the paper outlines open issues
   of existing approaches and highlights possible future evolution of these

Abstract = {{Financial forecasting is an area of research which has been attracting a
   lot of attention recently from practitioners in the field of artificial
   intelligence. Apart from the economic benefits of accurate financial
   prediction, the inherent nonlinearities in financial data make the task

   presents a survey of more than 100 articles published over two centuries
   (from 1933 up to 2013) in an attempt to identify the developments and
   trends in the field of financial forecasting with focus on application
   of artificial intelligence for the purpose. The findings from the survey
   indicate that artificial intelligence and signal processing based
   techniques are more efficient when compared to traditional financial
   forecasting techniques and these techniques appear well suited for the
   task of financial forecasting. Some of the issues that need addressing
   are discussed in brief. A novel technique for selection of the input
   dataset size for ensuring best possible forecast accuracy is also
   presented. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed

Journal = {{CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-83}},
Abstract = {{In Multi-Channel Multi-Radio Wireless Mesh Networks (MCMR-WMN), finding
   the optimal routing by satisfying the Quality of Service (QoS)
   constraints is an ambitious task. Multiple paths are available from the
   source node to the gateway for reliability, and sometimes it is
   necessary to deal with failures of the link in WMN. A major challenge in
   a MCMR-WMN is finding the routing with QoS satisfied and an interference
   free path from the redundant paths, in order to transmit the packets
   through this path. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an
   optimization technique to find the candidate solution in the search
   space optimally, and it applies artificial intelligence to solve the
   routing problem. On the other hand, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a
   population based meta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the
   natural evolution, such as selection, mutation and crossover. PSO can
   easily fall into a local optimal solution, at the same time GA is not
   suitable for dynamic data due to the underlying dynamic network. In this
   paper we propose an optimal intelligent routing, using a Hybrid PSO-GA,
   which also meets the QoS constraints. Moreover, it integrates the
   strength of PSO and GA. The QoS constraints, such as bandwidth, delay,
   jitter and interference are transformed into penalty functions. The
   simulation results show that the hybrid approach outperforms PSO and GA
   individually, and it takes less convergence time comparatively, keeping
   away from converging prematurely.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports the design of a randomly deployed heterogeneous
   wireless sensor network (HWSN) with two types of nodes: a powerful node
   and an ordinary node. Powerful nodes, such as Cluster Heads (CHs),
   communicate directly to the data sink of the network, and ordinary nodes
   sense the desired information and transmit the processed data to
   powerful nodes. The heterogeneity of HWSNs improves the networks
   lifetime and coverage. This paper focuses on the design of a random
   network among HWSNs. In the design of a random HWSN, this paper uses
   algorithms based on the binary-valued versions of swarm intelligence,
   such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC),
   and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The design is then considered to be
   an optimization problem of how many powerful and ordinary nodes will
   combine to minimize the network cost, while guaranteeing a desired
   coverage during a given period. Simulation results show the performance
   of each algorithm for solving the defined optimization problem.}},

   systems, and graph rewriting is one of the most frequently applied
   implementation techniques for their realization. As the necessity for
   reliable rule-based systems increases, so emerges the field of research
   regarding verification and validation of graph rewriting-based
   approaches. Verification and validation indicate determining the
   accuracy of a model transformation / rule-based system, and ensure that
   the processing output satisfies specific conditions. This paper
   introduces the concept of taming the complexity of these
   verification/validation solutions by starting with the most general case
   and moving towards more specific solutions. Furthermore, we provide a
   dynamic (online) method to support the validation of algorithms designed
   and executed in rule-based systems. The proposed approach is based on a
   graph rewriting-based solution.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of nature-inspired algorithms (NIA) is a great milestone
   in the field of computational intelligence community. As one of the
   NIAs, the artificial immune algorithm (AIS) mimics the principles of the
   biological immune system, and has exhibited its effectiveness, implicit
   parallelism, flexibility and applicability when solving various
   engineering problems. Nevertheless, AIS still suffers from the issues of
   evolution premature, local minima trapping and slow convergence due to
   its inherent stochastic search dynamics. Much effort has been made to
   improve the search performance of AIS from different aspects, such as
   population diversity maintenance, adaptive parameter control, etc. In
   this paper, we propose a novel multi-learning operator into the AIS to
   further enrich the search dynamics of the algorithm. A framework of
   embedding multiple commonly used mutation operators into the antibody
   evolution procedure is also established. Four distinct learning
   operators including baldwinian learning, cauchy mutation, gaussian
   mutation and lateral mutation are selected to merge together as a
   multi-learning operator. It can be expected that the multi-learning
   operator can effectively balance the exploration and exploitation of the
   search by enriched dynamics. To verify its performance, the proposed
   algorithm, which is called multi-learning immune algorithm (MLIA), is
   applied on a number of benchmark functions. Experimental results
   demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of
   convergence speed and solution quality.}},

Title = {{Feature Selection and Parameter Optimization of Support Vector Machines
   Based on Modified Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithms}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Rapid advances in information and communication technology have made
   ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things popular and practicable.
   These applications create enormous volumes of data, which are available
   for analysis and classification as an aid to decision-making. Among the
   classification methods used to deal with big data, feature selection has
   proven particularly effective. One common approach involves searching
   through a subset of the features that are the most relevant to the topic
   or represent the most accurate description of the dataset.
   Unfortunately, searching through this kind of subset is a combinatorial
   problem that can be very time consuming. Meaheuristic algorithms are
   commonly used to facilitate the selection of features. The artificial
   fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) employs the intelligence underlying fish
   swarming behavior as a means to overcome optimization of combinatorial
   problems. AFSA has proven highly successful in a diversity of
   applications; however, there remain shortcomings, such as the likelihood
   of falling into a local optimum and a lack of multiplicity. This study
   proposes a modified AFSA (MAFSA) to improve feature selection and
   parameter optimization for support vector machine classifiers.
   Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of MAFSA in
   classification accuracy using subsets with fewer features for given UCI
   datasets, compared to the original FASA.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{91-114}},
Abstract = {{Immunological computation is one of the largest recent bio-inspired
   approaches of artificial intelligence. Artificial immune systems (AIS)
   are inspired by the processes of the biological immune systems like the
   learning and memory characteristics which are used for solving complex
   problems. During the last two decades, AIS have been applied in various
   fields such as optimization, network security and data mining. In this
   article, we focus on the application of AIS to data mining in
   bioinformatics, more specifically, the classification task. For this
   purpose, we suggest three immune models based on clonal selection theory
   for the identification of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to predict
   their function. Our three classifiers are the artificial immune
   recognition system (AIRS), the clonal selection algorithm (CLONALG) and
   the clonal selection classification algorithm (CSCA). The GPCRs
   represent one of the largest and most important families of
   multifunctional proteins and are a significant target for bioactive and
   drug discovery programs. It is estimated that more than half of the
   drugs on the market currently target GPCRs. However, although thousands
   of GPCRs sequences are known, many of them remain orphans, have unknown
   function. Our experiments show that the three immunological classifiers
   have provided interesting results, however, AIRS obtained the best ones.
   Therefore, it is, for us, the most suitable immune model for the GPCRs
   identification problem.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expressions classification is a fast growing research area. Lots
   of contribution has been made in this area by researchers from fields of
   computer science, computer vision, artificial intelligence and
   psychology. There are many applications that use facial expression
   classification to identify the behavior, emotion, feelings and opinion
   of a person. Facial expression classification is not a trivial task as
   there are many factors that need to be accounted like low quality of
   images, noise, and shape/color of image. In this article, we have
   proposed an efficient facial expression classification scheme. In the
   first step, we perform some pre-processing steps like face detection and
   histogram equalization inorder to reduce the data dimenions and
   normalize the illumination effects. Then, an efficient feature
   extraction technique is used to extract the relevant face features. In
   the last step, we train and test Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
   to classify the facial expressions. Emirical results obtained using the
   JAFFE database suggest that the proposed technique produces impressive
   results by utilzing the best facial features.}},

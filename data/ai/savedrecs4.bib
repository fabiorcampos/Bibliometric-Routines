Title = {{Short-Term Wind Speed Forecasting Study and Its Application Using a
   Hybrid Model Optimized by Cuckoo Search}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The support vector regression (SVR) and neural network (NN) are both new
   tools from the artificial intelligence field, which have been
   successfully exploited to solve various problems especially for time
   series forecasting. However, traditional SVR and NN cannot accurately
   describe intricate time series with the characteristics of high
   volatility, nonstationarity, and nonlinearity, such as wind speed and
   electricity price time series. This study proposes an ensemble approach
   on the basis of 5-3 Hanning filter (5-3H) and wavelet denoising (WD)
   techniques, in conjunction with artificial intelligence optimization
   based SVR and NN model. So as to confirm the validity of the proposed
   model, two applicative case studies are conducted in terms of wind speed
   series from Gansu Province in China and electricity price from New South
   Wales in Australia. The computational results reveal that cuckoo search
   (CS) outperforms both PSO and GA with respect to convergence and global
   searching capacity, and the proposed CS-based hybrid model is effective
   and feasible in generating more reliable and skillful forecasts.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND SMART ENVIRONMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{425-448}},
Abstract = {{Modern Smart Environments (SmE) are equipped with a multitude of devices
   and sensors aimed at intelligent services. The variety of devices has
   raised a major problem of managing SmE. An increasingly adopted solution
   to the problem is the modeling of goals and intentions, and then using
   artificial intelligence to control the respective SmE accordingly.
   Generally, the solution advocates that the goals can be achieved by
   controlling the evolution of the states of the devices. In order to
   automatically reach a particular state, a sophisticated solution is
   required through which the respective commands, notifications and their
   correct sequence can be discovered and enforced on the real devices.
   In this paper, a comprehensive methodology is proposed by considering a)
   the composite nature of the state of an individual device; b) the
   possible variation of specific commands, notifications and their
   sequence based on the current states of the devices.
   The methodology works at two levels: design-time and runtime. At
   design-time, it constructs the extended data and control flow behavioral
   graphs of the devices by using the concepts of a model checking
   approach. Then, at runtime, it uses these graphs for finding the
   reliable evolution through which the desired goal can be fulfilled. The
   proposed methodology is implemented over the Domotic Effects framework
   and a home automation system, i.e. Domotic OSGi Gateway (Dog). The
   implementation and experimentation details indicate the effectiveness of
   the proposed approach.}},

Title = {{An Associate Rules Mining Algorithm Based on Artificial Immune Network
   for SAR Image Segmentation}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{As a computational intelligence method, artificial immune network (AIN)
   algorithm has been widely applied to pattern recognition and data
   classification. In the existing artificial immune network algorithms,
   the calculating affinity for classifying is based on calculating a
   certain distance, which may lead to some unsatisfactory results in
   dealing with data with nominal attributes. To overcome the shortcoming,
   the association rules are introduced into AIN algorithm, and we propose
   a new classification algorithm an associate rules mining algorithm based
   on artificial immune network (ARM-AIN). The new method uses the
   association rules to represent immune cells and mine the best
   association rules rather than searching optimal clustering centers. The
   proposed algorithm has been extensively compared with artificial immune
   network classification (AINC) algorithm, artificial immune network
   classification algorithm based on self-adaptive PSO (SPSO-AINC), and
   PSO-AINC over several large-scale data sets, target recognition of
   remote sensing image, and segmentation of three different SAR images.
   The result of experiment indicates the superiority of ARM-AIN in
   classification accuracy and running time.}},

   THE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF CONCRETE}},
Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORK WORLD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{301-318}},
Abstract = {{Applications of artificial intelligence in engineering disciplines have
   become widespread and have provided alternative solutions to engineering
   problems. Image processing technology (IPT) and artificial neural
   networks (ANNs) are types of artificial intelligence methods. However,
   IPT and ANN have been used together in extremely few studies. In this
   study, these two methods were used to determine the compressive strength
   of concrete, a complex material whose mechanical features are difficult
   to predict. Sixty cube-shaped specimens were manufactured, and images of
   specific features of the specimens were taken before they were tested to
   determine their compressive strengths. An ANN model was constituted as a
   result of the process of digitizing the images. In this way, the two
   different artificial intelligence methods were used together to carry
   out the analysis. The compressive strength values of the concrete
   obtained via analytical modeling were compared with the test results.
   The results of the comparison (R-2 = 0.9837-0.9961) indicate that the
   combination of these two artificial intelligence methods is highly
   capable of predicting the compressive strengths of the specimens. The
   model's predictive capability was also evaluated in terms of several
   statistical parameters using a set of statistical methods during the
   digitization of the images constituting the artificial neural network.}},

   strategy}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{853-882}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a franchising decision
   support system (FDSS) for future development planning by center
   positioning strategy formulation under a franchising business model.
   Design/methodology/approach - The system makes use of data collected
   from the franchising business and external environment analysis for
   decision making in center positioning problems. The fuzzy logic approach
   is integrated into the system for analyzing the geographical market
   dynamics including profitability and competitiveness in the district
   concerned. To demonstrate the application of the proposed FDSS, a case
   study is conducted in a Hong Kong-based franchising private education
   center, i.e. Dr I-Kids Education Center.
   Findings - The tailor made FDSS helps to facilitate the business
   operations of the franchising education center and develops a district
   positioning model for the centers located in the 18 districts of Hong
   Kong. The findings provide a solid foundation for marketing strategy and
   expansion direction formulation.
   Originality/value - Due to the globalization of business, managing a
   growing franchising business model becomes challenging to the
   franchisor. In order to fully leverage the merits of the franchising
   system, an intelligent decision support model, focusing on making
   strategic development plans, is needed so as to expand the scale of
   business efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on reservoir parameter estimation using extreme

   train and validate the neural network, and robust ELM algorithm provides
   fast and accurate prediction results, which is also testified by
   comparison with BP (back propagation) network and SVM(support vector
   machine) approaches. The network model is then applied to estimate
   porosity and permeability for the remaining wells. The predicted
   attributes match well with the oil test conclusions. Based on the
   estimations, reservoir porosity and permeability have been mapped and
   analyzed. Two favorable zones have been suggested for further research

Title = {{Triaxial Accelerometer Error Coefficients Identification with a Novel
   Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) is one of the state-of-the-art
   swarm intelligence techniques, which is widely utilized for optimization
   purposes. Triaxial accelerometer error coefficients are relatively
   unstable with the environmental disturbances and aging of the
   instrument. Therefore, identifying triaxial accelerometer error
   coefficients accurately and being with lower costs are of great
   importance to improve the overall performance of triaxial
   accelerometer-based strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS). In this
   study, a novel artificial fish swarm algorithm (NAFSA) that eliminated
   the demerits (lack of using artificial fishes' previous experiences,
   lack of existing balance between exploration and exploitation, and high
   computational cost) of AFSA is introduced at first. In NAFSA, functional
   behaviors and overall procedure of AFSA have been improved with some
   parameters variations. Second, a hybrid accelerometer error coefficients
   identification algorithm has been proposed based on NAFSA and Monte
   Carlo simulation (MCS) approaches. This combination leads to maximum
   utilization of the involved approaches for triaxial accelerometer error
   coefficients identification. Furthermore, the NAFSA-identified
   coefficients are testified with 24-position verification experiment and
   triaxial accelerometer-based SINS navigation experiment. The priorities
   of MCS-NAFSA are compared with that of conventional calibration method
   and optimal AFSA. Finally, both experiments results demonstrate high
   efficiency of MCS-NAFSA on triaxial accelerometer error coefficients
   identification.}},

Abstract = {{Water policies have evolved enormously since the Rio Earth Summit
   (1992). These changes have led to the strategic importance of water
   demand management. The aim is to provide water where and when it is
   required using the fewest resources. A key variable in this process is
   the demand forecasting. It is not sufficient to have long term
   forecasts, as the current context requires the continuous availability
   of reliable hourly predictions. This paper incorporates artificial
   intelligence to the subject, through an agent-based system, whose basis
   are complex forecasting methods (Box-Jenkins, Holt-Winters, multi-layer
   perceptron networks and radial basis function networks). The prediction
   system also includes data mining, oriented to the pre and post
   processing of data and to the knowledge discovery, and other agents.
   Thereby, the system is capable of choosing at every moment the most
   appropriate forecast, reaching very low errors. It significantly
   improves the results of the different methods separately.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid integration of physical systems with cyberspace
   infrastructure, the so-called Internet of Things, is likely to have a
   significant effect on how people interact with the physical environment
   and design information and communication systems. Internet-connected
   systems are expected to vastly outnumber people on the planet in the
   near future, leading to grand challenges in software engineering and
   automation in application domains involving complex and evolving
   systems. Several decades of artificial intelligence research suggests
   that conventional approaches to making such systems automatically
   interoperable using handcrafted ``semantic{''} descriptions of services
   and information are difficult to apply. In this paper we outline a
   bioinspired learning approach to creating interoperable systems, which
   does not require handcrafted semantic descriptions and rules. Instead,
   the idea is that a functioning system (of systems) can emerge from an
   initial pseudorandom state through learning from examples, provided that
   each component conforms to a set of information coding rules. We combine
   a binary vector symbolic architecture (V5A) with an associative memory
   known as sparse distributed memory (SDM) to model context-dependent
   prediction by learning from examples. We present simulation results
   demonstrating that the proposed architecture can enable system
   interoperability by learning, for example by human demonstration. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new continuous smooth motion planning
   algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) used in complex and
   dynamic underwater environments. Existing motion planning algorithms in
   artificial intelligence are not designed to deal with complex and
   dynamic continuous underwater environments prone to currents. We present
   a novel Fast Marching (FM) method to address the following issues.
   First, we develop an algorithm called Hybrid Search Fast Marching (HSFM)
   method, which gives consideration to both total path cost and
   computational time, to efficiently generate a 3D continuous smooth path
   from a discrete representation of underwater environments. Second, we
   develop a novel anisotropic FM algorithm to deal with underwater
   currents based on the geometric relationships between characteristic
   lines and gradient lines in speed profiles. Third, we introduce multiple
   decision criteria and constraints in complex and dynamic underwater
   environments such as currents, dynamic obstacles, reefs, shoals and
   navigation rules in motion planning process. Extensive random
   simulations for an AUV sail planning task show that the HSFM algorithm
   meets the time constraints of online replanning and finds continuous
   smooth paths of better cost in shorter time compared to the MSA{*} and
   A{*} algorithms.}},

   been developed depending on different intelligent behaviours of natural
   swarms. This review presents a comprehensive survey of swarm

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{36-49}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, many stochastic metaheuristics have been developed to solve
   various optimisation problems. The primary characteristics of these
   heuristics often involve the use of randomness in their search process.
   Essentially, randomness is useful when determining the next point in the
   search space and therefore has a crucial impact when exploring new
   solutions. In this paper, an extensive comparison is made between
   various probability distributions that can be used for randomising the
   swarm intelligence algorithms, e.g., uniform, Gaussian, Levy flights,
   chaotic maps, and the random sampling in turbulent fractal cloud. These
   randomisation methods were incorporated into the bat algorithm that is
   one of the newest member of this domain. In line with this, various
   variants of bat algorithms randomised with different randomisation
   methods have been developed and extensive experiments were conducted on
   a well-known set of 24 BBOB benchmark functions. In addition, the
   results of randomised bat algorithms were compared with the results of
   the other well-known algorithms, including the firefly algorithm,
   differential evolution and artificial bee colony algorithms. The results
   of these experiments show that the efficiencies of the distributions
   used during the tests depend on the problem to be solved as well as on
   the algorithm used.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{50-61}},
Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are getting more and more attention
   these days. Already, innumerable approaches have been proposed to solve
   various problems in WSNs. In this paper, we have proposed two swarm
   intelligence approaches, viz. artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and
   invasive weed optimisation (IWO) algorithm for the cover scheduling
   problem in WSNs where coverage breach is allowed either due to technical
   constraints or deliberately. The objective of the wireless sensor
   network cover scheduling problem (WSN-CSP) is to schedule the covers of
   sensors in such a manner so that the longest target breach is minimised.
   The WSN-CSP is an NP-Hard problem and is relatively under-studied. ABC
   algorithm is based on intelligent foraging behaviour of honey bee
   swarms, whereas IWO algorithm is based on colonising behaviour of weeds.
   For further improving the results obtained through ABC and IWO
   approaches, we have also devised a local search. Computational results
   show the effectiveness of our proposed approaches in comparison to a
   genetic algorithm and a problem specific heuristic available in the
   literature.}},

Pages = {{1577-1589}},
Abstract = {{Quality of power units' maintenance schedule is one of the most
   important factors, which influences reliability and efficiency of power
   plant exploitation process. The schedule is created during a planning
   process taking into consideration a lot of different criteria. These
   criteria result from bidirectional connections between power plant
   exploitation system and surrounding systems. Therefore they are
   formulated in completely different domains. The criteria often are
   defined approximately. Frequently they are contradictory so it is not
   possible to fulfil all the criteria simultaneously. Because of all these
   difficulties, the creation process of coherent assessment system,
   comprising all considered criteria, is very complicated. Additionally,
   the number of maintenance schedule possible variants is very big.
   Therefore, to reach high quality of maintenance management, it is
   necessary to apply automatic system of power units maintenance schedules
   generation. This paper describes the implementation of artificial
   intelligence techniques in the area of maintenance management. The
   automatic system of power units maintenance schedules generation was
   created using genetic algorithms as optimization technique and developed
   fuzzy assessment system. In the paper, the industrial implementation of
   the system is also presented.}},

Title = {{Towards an automatic user profiling system for online information sites
   Identifying demographic determining factors}},
Journal = {{ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{61-80}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify demographic
   differences based on how users interact with web applications. The
   research is needed to develop future systems able to adapt the
   representation of online information to the user's specific needs and
   preferences improving its usability. The following question guides this
   quest: is there a direct relationship between age and/or gender and
   interaction?
   Design/methodology/approach - GOMS (goals, operators, methods, and
   selection rules) analysis was used to reduce complex interaction tasks
   into basic operators like pointing, dragging, typing, etc. An experiment
   was designed to analyse the user performance in the use of these
   operators through five complex tasks: point-and-click, drag-and-drop,
   text selection, text edition and menu selection. The sample comprises
   592 individuals which took part in the experiment. The performance was
   analysed using multivariate regression analysis. User laterality and the
   the user experience were used as control variables.
   Findings - The factors studied are significant enough to support user
   classification. The analysis evidenced that men performed significantly
   better than women when executing interaction pointing and dragging
   GOMS's operators, but no significant differences arose with regard to
   the performance in the typing operators. Older users performed worse in
   all the interaction tasks. No significant performance differences were
   detected between left and right-handed users.
   Research limitations/implications - The study pretends to lay the ground
   for developing artificial intelligence-based classification systems
   (e.g. neural networks, decision trees, etc.) able to detect significant
   differences in user performance, classifying users according to their
   age, gender and laterality.
   Practical implications - This user profiling would drive the
   organisation, selection and representation of the online information
   according to the specific preferences and needs of each user. This would
   allow the design of new personalisation algorithms able to perform
   dynamic adaptation of user interfaces in order to improve the usability
   of online information systems.
   Originality/value - This work extends previous research on user
   performance under a new approach and improved accuracy. First, it relies
   on the combined and simultaneous analysis of ageing and gender and the
   use of user laterality and experience as control variables. Second, the
   use of the GOMS analysis allowed the design of tests that closely
   resemble the user interaction in online information systems. Third, the
   size of the sample used in this analysis is much bigger than those used
   in previous works, allowing a more thorough data analysis which includes
   the estimation of an advanced model which is quantile regression.}},

Abstract = {{The benefits of livestock breeders are usually closely related to the
   weight of their animals. In this paper we present a method to anticipate
   the weight of each animal provided we know the past evolution of the
   herd. Our approach exploits the geometrical relationships of the
   trajectories of weights along the time. Starting from a collection of
   data from a set of animals, we learn a family of parallel functions that
   fits the whole data set, instead of having one regression function for
   each individual. In this way, our method enables animals with only one
   or a few weights to have an accurate estimation of their future
   evolution. Thus, we learn a function F defined on the space of weights
   and time that separates the trajectories in such a way that F has
   constant values on each trajectory. The key point is that the
   specification of F can be done in terms of ordering constraints, in the
   same way as preference functions or ordinal regressors. Therefore, F can
   be obtained from a classification SVM (Support Vector Machines). To
   evaluate the method, we have used a collection of real world data sets
   of bovines of different breeds and ages. We will show that our method
   outperforms the separate regression of each animal when there are only a
   few weights available and we need medium or long term predictions. (C)

Abstract = {{Recognition of power quality events by analyzing voltage waveform
   disturbances is a very important task for power system monitoring. This
   paper presents a hybrid intelligent scheme for the classification of
   power quality disturbances. The proposed algorithm is realized through
   three main steps: feature extraction, feature selection and feature
   classification. The feature vectors are extracted using S-transform (ST)
   and Wavelet transform (WT) which are very powerful time-frequency
   analysis tools. In order to avoid large dimension of feature vector,
   three different approaches are applied for feature selection step,
   namely Sequential Forward Selection (SFS), Sequential Backward Selection
   (SBS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the next step, the most meaningful
   features are applied to Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) as classifier
   core. Various transient events, such as voltage sag, swell,
   interruption, harmonics, transient, sag with harmonics, swell with
   harmonics, and flicker, are tested. Sensitivity of the proposed
   algorithm under different noisy conditions is investigated in this
   article. Results show that the classifier can detect and classify
   different power quality signals, even under noisy conditions, with high
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a logic-based, framework inspired by artificial
   intelligence, but scaled down for practical database and programming
   applications. Computation in the framework is viewed as the task of
   generating a sequence of state transitions, with the purpose of making
   an agent's goals all true. States are represented by sets of atomic
   sentences (or facts), representing the values of program variables,
   tuples in a coordination language, facts in relational databases, or
   Herbrand models.
   In the model-theoretic semantics, the entire sequence of states and
   events are combined into a single model-theoretic structure, by
   associating timestamps with facts and events. But in the operational
   semantics, facts are updated destructively, without timestamps. We show
   that the model generated by destructive updates is identical to the
   model generated by reasoning with facts containing timestamps. We also
   extend the model with intentional predicates and composite event
   predicates defined by logic programs containing conditions in
   first-order logic, which query the current state.}},

Abstract = {{Research on robot soccer confrontation decision-making technology (CDMT)

   model (MOGM). MOGM is very suitable to multiple-robot competition. This
   technology establishes corresponding local information action-based game
   for every involved soccer robot. Then a global information
   strategy-based game by the linear weighted sum of the individual robots'
   local information games is evaluated. Thereby, the proposed method
   generates the global optimal strategy that meets the requirement of

Title = {{Developing a Robust Surrogate Model of Chemical Flooding Based on the
   Artificial Neural Network for Enhanced Oil Recovery Implications}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Application of chemical flooding in petroleum reservoirs turns into hot
   topic of the recent researches. Development strategies of the
   aforementioned technique are more robust and precise when we consider
   both economical points of view (net present value, NPV) and technical
   points of view (recovery factor, RF). In current study many attempts
   have been made to propose predictive model for estimation of efficiency
   of chemical flooding in oil reservoirs. To gain this end, a couple of
   swarm intelligence and artificial neural network (ANN) is employed.
   Also, lucrative and high precise chemical flooding data banks reported
   in previous attentions are utilized to test and validate proposed
   intelligent model. According to the mean square error (MSE), correlation
   coefficient, and average absolute relative deviation, the suggested
   swarm approach has acceptable reliability, integrity and robustness.
   Thus, the proposed intelligent model can be considered as an alternative
   model to predict the efficiency of chemical flooding in oil reservoir
   when the required experimental data are not available or accessible.}},

Title = {{Optimization and Parameters Estimation in Ultrasonic Echo Problems Using

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIONIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{The patterns of ultrasonic backscattered echoes represent valuable
   information pertaining to the geometric shape, size, and orientation of
   the reflectors as well as the microstructure of the propagation path.
   Accurate estimation of the ultrasonic echo pattern is essential in
   determining the object or propagation path properties. This paper
   proposes a parameter estimation method for ultrasonic echoes based on
   Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm which is one of the most recent
   swarm intelligence based algorithms. A modified ABC (MABC) algorithm is
   given by adding an adjusting factor to the neighborhood search formula
   of traditional ABC algorithm in order to enhance its performance. The
   algorithm could overcome the impact of different search range on
   estimation accuracy to solve the multi-dimensional parameter
   optimization problems. The performance of the MABC algorithm is
   demonstrated by numerical simulation and ultrasonic detection
   experiments. Results show that MABC not only can accurately estimate
   various parameters of the ultrasonic echoes, but also can achieve the
   optimal solution in the global scope. The proposed algorithm also has
   the advantages of fast convergence speed, short running time and
   real-time parameters estimation.}},

   improved artificial bee colony algorithm}},
Journal = {{AEU-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{206-214}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, new planar spiral antennas for passive RFID tag
   application at UHF band are designed and optimized using a new
   artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. We apply the improved ABC
   (I-ABC), which is an improved version of the original ABC algorithm. The
   I-ABC introduces the best-so-far solution, inertia weight and
   acceleration coefficients to modify the search process. The optimization
   goals are antenna size minimization, gain maximization and conjugate
   matching. The antenna dimensions were optimized and evaluated using
   I-ABC in conjunction with commercial EM software. We compare the I-ABC
   with the original ABC algorithm. The obtained results show that both
   algorithms are powerful optimizers that can be efficiently applied to
   tag antenna design problems. I-ABC produces better results than the
   original ABC algorithm in terms of solution accuracy and success rate.
   RFID tags with dimensions less than 3 cm, maximum gain that reaches the
   value of 1.46 dBi and read distance more than 10 m were among those
   obtained by the algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Hyponymy Graph Model for Word Semantic Similarity Measurement}},
Journal = {{CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{96-101}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Measuring word semantic similarity is a generic problem with a broad
   range of applications such as ontology mapping, computational
   linguistics and artificial intelligence. Previous approaches to
   computing word semantic similarity did not consider concept occurrence
   frequency and word's sense number. This paper introduced Hyponymy graph,
   and based on which proposed a novel word semantic similarity model. For
   two words to be compared, we first retrieve their related concepts; then
   produce lowest common ancestor matrix and distance matrix between
   concepts; finally calculate distance-based similarity and
   information-based similarity, which are integrated to get final semantic
   similarity. The main contribution of our method is that both concept
   occurrence frequency and word's sense number are taken into account.
   This similarity measurement more closely fits with human rating and
   effectively simulates human thinking process. Our experimental results
   on benchmark dataset M\&C and R\&G with WordNet2.1 as platform
   demonstrate roughly 0.9\%-1.2\% improvements over existing best
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The malicious computer code immune system and the biological immune

   mainly composed of four major components: the immune information

   immunization information discrimination program, and immune response
   program. An imbalanced support vector machine method was applied to
   optimize output results of malicious code immunization, thereby removing
   uncertain malicious code immune outputs. This demonstrates in detail the
   feasibility of the imbalanced support vector machine method in
   optimizing the immunization program output data. We showed that an
   imbalanced support vector machines can optimize the outputs of the

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to present a new hierarchic method based on
   swarm intelligence algorithms for solving the well-known traveling
   salesman problem. The swarm intelligence algorithms implemented in this
   study are divided into 2 types: path construction-based and path
   improvement-based methods. The path construction-based method (ant
   colony optimization (ACO)) produces good solutions but takes more time
   to achieve a good solution, while the path improvement-based technique
   (artificial bee colony (ABC)) quickly produces results but does not
   achieve a good solution in a reasonable time. Therefore, a new
   hierarchic method, which consists of both ACO and ABC, is proposed to
   achieve a good solution in a reasonable time. ACO is used to provide a
   better initial solution for the ABC, which uses the path improvement
   technique in order to achieve an optimal or near optimal solution.
   Computational experiments are conducted on 10 instances of well-known
   data sets available in the literature. The results show that ACO-ABC
   produces better quality solutions than individual approaches of ACO and
   ABC with better central processing unit time.}},

   are processed using the parallel matrix structure of the FSM to reach a
   global solution quickly. The parameters of a power transformer are used
   to verify the algorithm under 4 operating conditions simulated in the

Abstract = {{Freestyle formations appear widely in animation of groups. Most existing
   algorithms for generating special formations focus on the visualization
   performances of target formations, while social dynamics factors in the
   process of crowd motion are ignored. Thus, disregarding those factors
   will decrease the bionic features and fidelity of the crowd motion.
   According to this problem, a method based on bionic intelligence
   algorithm and self-adaptive evaluation to generate special formations is
   proposed in this paper. Simulation effect with good fluency and lively
   interaction is generated by means of user interaction, data analysis and
   crowd motion. In this method, 3D reconstruction is used to repaint
   characters, graphics or patterns in the 3D modeling system to build the
   basic virtual scene. Then, station points are generated through
   interlacing cross sampling. Based on the concentric circles model of
   fitness, each individual, self-adaptively, chooses a target station
   point which matches it aptly. Finally, the Artificial Bee Colony
   algorithm is used for path planing to generate the optimum route to the
   destination without collision. Visual simulation experiments are also
   made on the platforms of ACIS/HOOPS and Maya. The results show that this
   method can generate the optimum target formation with natural motion
   features and in accordance with users' input. This method is also
   insensitive to the scale of crowd, exhibiting good performance when the
   number of individuals is large.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial intelligence and decision support systems offer a plethora of
   health monitoring capabilities in ambient assisted living environment.
   Continuous assessment of health indicators for elderly people living on
   their own is of utmost importance, so as to prolong their independence

   are not easily identifiable in seniors. Thus, early sign detection of a
   specific condition, as well as, any likely transition from a healthy
   state to a pathological one are key problems that the herein proposed
   framework aims at resolving. Statistical process control concepts offer
   a personalized approach toward identification of trends that are away
   from the atypical behavior or state of the seniors, while fuzzy
   cognitive maps knowledge representation and inference schema have proved
   to be efficient in terms of disease classification. Geriatric depression
   is used as a case study throughout the paper, so to prove the validity
   of the framework, which is planned to be pilot tested with a series of

Title = {{Less computationally intensive fuzzy logic (type-1)-based controller for
   humanoid push recovery}},
Journal = {{ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present a new type-1 fuzzy logic-based controller for
   push recovery by humanoids. The objective of this study is to develop an
   intelligent controller and to implement biologically inspired push
   recovery for humanoid robots. The fuzzy inference system takes two crisp
   values as inputs, which are fuzzified, before a number of rules are
   applied, and finally the output is defuzzified to convert it into a
   crisp value. We apply fuzzy rules to our model, which we simulate in an
   unstructured environment. The objective is to reduce the fuzzy rules and
   make the fuzzy inference set less computationally intensive and fast, as
   well as exploiting the advantages of easy trainability and high
   generalizability. The fuzzy logic-based controller can predict the
   requisite push recovery strategy and whether the robot will be able to
   recover or fall. The architecture has a hierarchical design. The first
   fuzzy inference system (FIS1) is based on two input variables: the force
   and the direction of motion, where the result depends on the magnitude
   of the force applied to the body and direction in which the body moves
   after being pushed. FIS1 can determine small, medium, and large forces
   in term of roll and pitch effects on the body. These outputs are the
   input variables employed by FIS2 to predict the push recovery strategy
   that will be applied, and eventually the robot will be able to recover
   from a push or fall. The term ``auto-leaning{''} from human autonomy is
   introduced in the context of push recovery. We extend the Gordon model
   for balancing humanoids using fuzzy logic by considering the effects of
   roll, pitch, and yaw. This extends earlier research in the field of
   humanoid push recovery, where the force was only applied in one
   direction, to studies of pushing in different directions. In a cluttered
   environment, pushing is a very common experience, from which humans can
   readily recover whereas humanoid robots cannot. Humanoid robots have
   more degrees of freedom, thus finding solutions using alternative
   methods is not a simple task. The novel feature of this study is the
   introduction of an intuitive fuzzy logic-based learning approach and we
   show that it is fast and effective. This exhaustive fuzzy logic-based
   design is the main focus of this study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{It is well known that medical knowledge is growing so rapidly that it is
   difficult or impossible for healthcare professionals to keep up. More
   and more techniques for diagnosing and treating diseases are becoming
   available, yet new research findings and clinical practices are slow to
   spread. Information technology and the internet are providing important
   new ways of disseminating knowledge in healthcare as in many other
   domains. Knowledge engineering techniques for supporting decision-making
   and process management are also becoming available, and can be used to
   support busy clinicians, helping to ensure that their decisions are
   consistent with current knowledge and clinical procedures are carried
   out in a timely, efficient and safe way. The OpenClinical.net project is
   building on these techniques to demonstrate a new paradigm for
   disseminating knowledge and promoting best practice. The key idea is
   that much professional expertise can be modelled as
   computer-interpretable knowledge and used to assist decision-making,
   workflow management, communication and coordination of care and many
   other professional tasks. The central goal of OpenClinical.net is to
   demonstrate how this might be done at scale, through a form of ``crowd
   sourcing{''}, in order to create and maintain a sharable knowledge base
   that is available in an open access and open source repository. This
   paper provides an overview of the project and a summary of progress to

Abstract = {{Wind speed forecasting is challenging due to its intermittent nature.
   The wind speed time series (TS) has nonlinear and nonstationary
   characteristics and not normally distributed, which make it difficult to
   be predicted by statistical or computational intelligent methods.
   Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and its improved versions are
   powerful tools to decompose a complex TS into a collection of simpler
   ones. The improved versions discussed in this paper include ensemble EMD
   (EEMD), complementary EEMD (CEEMD), and complete EEMD with adaptive
   noise (CEEMDAN). The EMD and its improved versions are hybridized with
   two computational intelligence-based predictors: support vector
   regression (SVR) and artificial neural network (ANN). The EMD-based
   hybrid forecasting methods are evaluated with 12 wind speed TS. The
   performances of the hybrid methods are compared and discussed. It shows
   that EMD and its improved versions enhance the performance of SVR
   significantly but marginally on ANN, and among the EMD-based hybrid
   methods, the proposed CEEMDAN-SVR is the best method. Possible future
   works are also recommended for wind speed forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of forthcoming faults in modern industrial machines
   plays a key role in reducing production arrest, increasing the safety of
   plant operations, and optimizing manufacturing costs. The most effective
   condition monitoring techniques are based on the analysis of historical
   process data. In this paper we show how Least Squares Support Vector
   Machines (LS-SVMs) can be used effectively for early fault detection in
   an online fashion. Although LS-SVMs are existing artificial intelligence
   methods, in this paper the novelty is represented by their successful
   application to a complex industrial use case, where other approaches are
   commonly used in practice. In particular, in the first part we present
   an unsupervised approach that uses Kernel Spectral Clustering (KSC) on
   the sensor data coming from a vertical form seal and fill (VFFS)
   machine, in order to distinguish between normal operating condition and
   abnormal situations. Basically, we describe how KSC is able to detect in
   advance the need of maintenance actions in the analysed machine, due the
   degradation of the sealing jaws. In the second part we illustrate a
   nonlinear auto-regressive (WAR) model, thus a supervised learning
   technique, in the LS-SVM framework. We show that we succeed in modelling
   appropriately the degradation process affecting the machine, and we are
   capable to accurately predict the evolution of dirt accumulation in the
   sealing jaws. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{319-335}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses off-line diagnosis of embedded functions, such as
   that made in workshops by the technicians. The diagnosis problem
   expresses as the determination of a proper sequence of tests and
   measures at available control points, which would lead to greedily
   localize the fault quickly and at the lowest cost. Whereas anticipated
   discrete faults can be properly addressed by fault dictionary methods
   based on simulation, a consistency based method designed for hybrid
   systems is proposed to address parametric faults and non-anticipated
   faults. This method uses those same inputs as the fault dictionary
   method and the only additional information is the structure of the
   reference models in the form of a causal graph and the interpretation of
   the simulation results into qualitative values and events. The
   consistency based diagnosis method is combined with a test selection
   procedure to produce an original iterative diagnosis method for hybrid
   systems that reduces diagnosis ambiguity at each iteration.
   The method is illustrated in the automotive domain with a real case
   study consisting in the electronic function commanding the rear
   windscreen wiper of a car. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of a tool, based on a Bayesian
   network model, that provides posteriori predictions of operational risk
   events, aggregate operational loss distributions, and Operational
   Value-at-Risk, for a structured finance operations unit located within
   one of Australia's major banks. The Bayesian network, based on a
   previously developed causal framework, has been designed to model the
   smaller and more frequent, attritional operational loss events. Given
   the limited availability of risk factor event information and
   operational loss data, we rely on the elicitation of subjective
   probabilities, sourced from domain experts. Parameter sensitivity
   analysis is performed to validate and check the model's robustness
   against the beliefs of risk management and operational staff. To ensure
   that the domain's evolving risk profile is captured through time, a
   formal approach to organizational learning is investigated that employs
   the automatic parameter adaption features of the Bayesian network model.
   A hypothetical case study is then described to demonstrate model
   adaption and the application of the tool to operational loss forecasting
   by a business unit risk manager.}},

Abstract = {{The use of high voltage power lines transport involves some risks that
   may be avoided with periodic reviews as imposed by law in most
   countries. The objective of this work is to reduce the number of these
   periodic reviews so that the maintenance cost of power lines is also
   reduced. To reduce the number of transmission towers (TT) to be
   reviewed, a virtual organization (VO) based system of agents is proposed
   in conjunction with different artificial intelligence methods and
   algorithms. This system is able to propose a sample of TT from a
   selected set to be reviewed and to ensure that the whole set will have
   similar values without needing to review all the TT. As a result, the
   system provides a software solution to manage all the review processes
   and all the TT of Spain, allowing the review companies to use the
   application either when they initiate a new review process for a whole
   line or area of TT, or when they want to place an entirely new set of
   TT, in which case the system would recommend the best place and the best
   type of structure to use.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Bankruptcy prediction is one of the most important business
   decision-making problems. Intelligent techniques have been employed in
   order to develop models capable of predicting business failure cases.
   The present article provides a systematic literature review of the
   field. As opposed to previous reviews which concentrate on the
   classification methods, this study adopts a much broader approach to the
   bankruptcy prediction problem. The survey is articulated around six
   major axes which cover all the range of issues related to bankruptcy
   prediction. These axes are the definition of main research objectives,
   the employed classification methods, performance metrics issues, the
   input data and data sets, feature selection and input vectors and
   finally, the interpretation of the models and the extraction of domain
   knowledge. The findings and employed methodologies of the collected
   papers are categorized, presented and assessed according to these axes.
   The ultimate goal is to detect weaknesses and omissions and to highlight
   research opportunities. We hope that future researchers will find this
   survey useful in their attempt to orientate their efforts and to locate
   interesting topics for further research.}},

Journal = {{COGENT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Water with large velocities can cause considerable damage to channels
   whose beds are composed of natural earth materials. Several stilling
   basins and energy dissipating devices have been designed in conjunction
   with spillways and outlet works to avoid damages in canals' structures.
   In addition, lots of experimental and traditional mathematical numerical
   works have been performed to profoundly investigate the accurate design
   of these stilling basins and energy dissipaters. The current study is
   aimed toward introducing the artificial intelligence technique as new
   modeling tool in the prediction of the accurate design of stilling
   basins. Specifically, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are utilized in
   the current study in conjunction with experimental data to predict the
   length of the hydraulic jumps occurred in spillways and consequently the
   stilling basin dimensions can be designed for adequate energy
   dissipation. The current study showed, in a detailed fashion, the
   development process of different ANN models to accurately predict the
   hydraulic jump lengths acquired from different experimental studies. The
   results obtained from implementing these models showed that ANN
   technique was very successful in simulating the hydraulic jump
   characteristics occurred in stilling basins. Therefore, it can be safely
   utilized in the design of these basins as ANN involves minimum
   computational and financial efforts and requirements compared with
   experimental work and traditional numerical techniques such as finite
   difference or finite elements.}},

Abstract = {{Business intelligence (BI) combined with business analytics (BA) is an
   increasingly prominent strategic objective for many organizations. As a
   pedagogical subject, BI/BA is still in its infancy, and, in order for
   this to mature, we need to develop an undergraduate model BI/BA
   curriculum. BI/BA as an academic domain is emerging as a hybrid of
   disciplines, including information systems, statistics, management
   science, artificial intelligence, computer science, and business
   practice/theory. Based on IS 2010's model curriculum constructs (Topi et
   al., 2010), we explore two curricular options: a BI/BA concentration in
   a typical IS major and a comprehensive, integrated BI/BA undergraduate
   major. In support, we present evidence of industry need for BI/BA,
   review the current state of BI/BA education, and compare anticipated
   requirements for BI/BA curricula with the IS 2010 model curriculum. For
   this initial phase of curricular design, we postulate a preliminary set
   of knowledge areas relevant for BI/BA pedagogy in a multi-disciplinary
   framework. Then we discuss avenues for integrating these knowledge areas
   to develop professionally prepared BI/BA specializations at the
   undergraduate level. We also examine implications for both AACSB and
   ABET accreditation and describe the next phase of applying the IS 2010
   concept structure to BI/BA curriculum development.}},

Title = {{Questions, Answers, and Presuppositions}},
Journal = {{COMPUTACION Y SISTEMAS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{647-659}},
Abstract = {{The paper deals with empirical questions that come attached with a
   presupposition. In case that the presupposition is not true, there is no
   unambiguous direct answer. In such a case an adequate complete answer is
   a negated presupposition. Yet these simple ideas are connected with a
   bunch of problems. First, we must distinguish between a pragmatic and
   semantic presupposition, and thus also between a presupposition and mere
   entailment. Second, we show that the common definition of a
   presupposition of a question as such a proposition that is entailed by
   every possible answer to the question is not precise. We follow Frege
   and Strawson in treating survival under negation as the most important
   test for presupposition. But a negative answer to a question is often
   ambiguous. The ambiguity consists in not distinguishing between two
   kinds of negative answers, to wit the answers applying narrow-scope or
   wide-scope negation. While the former preserves presupposition, the
   latter seems to be presupposition denying. We show that in order the
   negative answer to be unambiguous, instead of the wide-scope negation
   presumably denying presupposition, an adequate and unambiguous answer is
   just the negated presupposition. Having defined presupposition of a
   question more precisely, we then examine Yes-No questions, Whquestions,
   and exclusive-or questions with respect to several kinds of
   presupposition triggers. These include inter alia topic-focus
   articulation, verbs expressing termination of an activity, factive
   verbs, the, whys and how comes{''}, and past or future tense with
   reference time interval. Our background theory is Transparent
   Intensional Logic (TIL) with its procedural semantics. TIL is an
   expressive logic apt for analysis of questions and presuppositions,
   because within TIL we work with partial functions, in particular, with
   propositions with truth-value gaps. These features enabled us to define
   a general analytic schema of sentences associated with a presupposition.
   Our results are applicable in linguistics and artificial intelligence,
   in particular, in the systems the behavior of which is controlled by
   communication and reasoning of intelligent social agents.}},

Abstract = {{As a new global optimisation technique, artificial bee colony (ABC)
   algorithm becomes popular in recent years for its simplicity and
   effectiveness. In the basic ABC, however, the solution search equation
   updates only one dimension to produce a new candidate solution, which
   may result in that the offspring becomes similar to its parent and cause
   insufficient search. To overcome this drawback, we proposes an enhanced
   ABC (EABC) variant by utilising the generalised opposition-based
   learning (GOBL) strategy. With the help of GOBL, much more promising
   search regions can be explored, so the probability of converging to the
   global optimum is highly increased. Experiments are conducted on 13
   well-known benchmark functions to verify the proposed approach, and the
   results show that EABC is very promising in terms of solution accuracy
   and convergence speed.}},

Title = {{Corner features extraction: underwater SLAM in structured environments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{556-569}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a method to extract
   corner features for map building purposes in man-made structured
   underwater environments using the sliding-window technique.
   Design/methodology/approach - The sliding-window technique is used to
   extract corner features, and Mechanically Scanned Imaging Sonar (MSIS)
   is used to scan the environment for map building purposes. The tests
   were performed with real data collected in a swimming pool.
   Findings - The change in application environment and the use of MSIS
   present some important differences, which must be taken into account
   when dealing with acoustic data. These include motion-induced
   distortions, continuous data flow, low scan frequency and high noise
   levels. Only part of the data stored in each scan sector is important
   for feature extraction; therefore, a segmentation process is necessary
   to extract more significant information. To deal with continuous flow of
   data, data must be separated into 360 degrees scan sectors. Although the
   vehicle is assumed to be static, there is a drift in both its rotational
   and translational motions because of currents in the water; these drifts
   induce distortions in acoustic images. Therefore, the bearing
   information and the current vehicle pose corresponding to the selected
   scan-lines must be stored and used to compensate for motion-induced
   distortions in the acoustic images. As the data received is very noisy,
   an averaging filter should be applied to achieve an even distribution of
   data points, although this is partly achieved through the segmentation
   process. On the selected sliding window, all the point pairs must pass
   the distance and angle tests before a corner can be initialised. This
   minimises mapping of outlier data points but can make the algorithm
   computationally expensive if the selected window is too wide. The
   results show the viability of this procedure under very noisy data. The
   technique has been applied to 50 data sets/scans sectors with a success
   rate of 83 per cent.
   Research limitations/implications - MSIS gives very noisy data. There
   are limited sensorial modes for underwater applications.
   Practical implications - The extraction of corner features in structured
   man-made underwater environments opens the door for SLAM systems to a
   wide range of applications and environments.
   Originality/value - A method to extract corner features for map building
   purposes in man-made structured underwater environments is presented
   using the sliding-window technique.}},

   i. e. neural networks and support vector machine, and on the
   classification results of classical classification methods represented
   by RIPPER and the Naive Bayes classifier. All experiments are conducted
   on 30 different imbalanced datasets obtained from KEEL (Knowledge
   Extraction based on Evolutionary Learning) repository. With the purpose
   of measuring the quality of classification, the accuracy and the a rea
   under ROC curve (AUC) measures are used. The results of the research
   indicate that the neural network and support vector machine show
   improvement of the AUC measure when applied to balanced data, but at the
   same time, they show the deterioration of results from the aspect of
   classification accuracy. RIPPER results are also similar, but the
   changes are of a smaller magnitude, while the results of the Naive Bayes
   classifier show overall deterioration of results on balanced
   distributions. The number of instances in the presented highly
   imbalanced datasets has significant additional impact on the
   classification performances of the SVM classifier. The results have
   shown the potential of the SVM classifier for the ensemble creation on
   imbalanced datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, there is an increasing interest in educational data mining.
   E-learning systems have become pervasive in educational contexts, and
   they are more necessary than ever in order to get relevant information
   on students and learning activities. However, the amount of raw data
   produced makes unfeasible its manual processing, so (semi-)automated
   solutions are required. In this context, the paradigms of data mining
   and artificial intelligence offer multiple techniques to provide these
   solutions. Among these techniques, this work makes a review of published
   and tested techniques with satisfactory results under the different
   aspects of fuzzy logic. The choice of the fuzzy logic makes sense here,
   as it is a theory close to some forms of human reasoning. In e-learning
   systems, the main actors are teachers and students, and the data to
   manipulate are related to their modelling and the results of their
   actions. Fuzzy techniques make possible a representation of this
   knowledge and its manipulation under a human approach, which is
   well-suited to be understood by the main actors of the domain.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, accelerated particle swarm optimization (APSO) derived from

   Therefore, this paper proposed an accelerated particle swarm optimized
   back propagation neural network (APSO-BP) algorithm in order to overcome
   the problems faced in BP algorithm. By using APSO to optimize the
   weights at each iterations of BP algorithm, the proposed APSO-BP is able
   to increase the convergence speed and avoids local minima. The
   simulation results demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms
   the traditional BP method and achieves the objectives of this research,

   biomathematical field, there are many unknown parameters, and commonly,
   the parameter is in nonlinear form. Global optimisation method includes
   differential evolution algorithm, which will be used in this research.

   presents a challenge to how Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems not

   also produce more natural-seeming language; however, most AI research on

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Pages = {{74-89}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The multiple traveling salesperson problem (MTSP) is similar to famous
   traveling salesperson problem (TSP) except for the fact that there are
   more than one salesperson to visit the cities though each city must be
   visited exactly once by only one salesperson. For this problem, we have
   considered two different objectives. First one is to minimize the total
   distance traveled by all the salespersons, whereas the second one is to
   minimize the maximum distance traveled by anyone salesperson. This
   latter objective is about fairness as it tries to balance the workload
   among salespersons. MTSP, being a generalization of TSP under both the
   objectives, is also NP-Hard. In this paper, we have proposed two
   metaheuristic approaches for the MTSP. The first approach is based on
   artificial bee colony algorithm, whereas the second approach is based on
   invasive weed optimization algorithm. We have also applied a local
   search to further improve the solution obtained through our approaches.
   Computational results on a wide range of benchmark instances show the
   superiority of our proposed approaches over all the other
   state-of-the-art approaches for this problem on both the objectives. (C)

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Pages = {{166-179}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Scheduling has become a popular area for artificial intelligence and
   expert system researchers during last decade. In this paper, a new
   metaheuristic algorithm entitled intelligent water drops (IWD) is
   adapted for solving a generalized kind of order scheduling problem where
   rejection of received orders is allowed with a penalty cost. At the
   beginning of production period, a set of orders are received by
   manufacturer. Due to capacity limit, the manufacturer can only process a
   subset of orders and has to decide to reject some of undesirable orders.
   The accepted orders are proceed to be scheduled by a set of identical
   parallel processors in shop floor. The objective is to select the best
   set of orders with high contribution in manufacturer's benefit and then
   find the appropriate schedule of accepted orders minimizing the number
   of tardy orders. To effectively solve the suggested problem, the
   Lexicographic utility function is customized to address different
   objectives and then an IWD algorithm, which is based on the process of
   the natural rivers and the interactions among water drops in a river, is
   devised. To further enhance the performance of basic IWD, an Iterated
   Local Search (ILS) heuristic is also incorporated into the main
   algorithm. To demonstrate the applicability of suggested problem and
   also show the effectiveness of enhanced IWD with ILS, a real-world
   application in commercial printing industry is presented and the
   performance of algorithm is compared with traditional algorithms like
   GA, DE and ACO. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A directed artificial bee colony algorithm}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has been introduced for solving
   numerical optimization problems, inspired collective behavior of honey
   bee colonies. ABC algorithm has three phases named as employed bee,
   onlooker bee and scout bee. In the model of ABC, only one design
   parameter of the optimization problem is updated by the artificial bees
   at the ABC phases by using interaction in the bees. This updating has
   caused the slow convergence to global or near global optimum for the
   algorithm. In order to accelerate convergence of the method, using a
   control parameter (modification rate-MR) has been proposed for ABC but
   this approach is based on updating more design parameters than one. In
   this study, we added directional information to ABC algorithms, instead
   of updating more design parameters than one. The performance of proposed
   approach was examined on well-known nine numerical benchmark functions
   and obtained results are compared with basic ABC and ABCs with MR. The
   experimental results show that the proposed approach is very effective
   method for solving numeric benchmark functions and successful in terms
   of solution quality, robustness and convergence to global optimum. (C)

Journal = {{OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{1-17}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We develop a new genetic algorithm to solve an integrated
   Equipment-Workforce-Service Planning problem, which features extremely
   large scales and complex constraints. Compared with the canonical
   genetic algorithm, the new algorithm is innovative in four respects: (1)
   The new algorithm addresses epistasis of genes by decomposing the
   problem variables into evolutionary variables, which evolve with the
   genetic operators, and the optimization variables, which are derived by
   solving corresponding optimization problems. (2) The new algorithm
   introduces the concept of Capacity Threshold and calculates the Set of
   Efficient and Valid Equipment Assignments to preclude unpromising
   solution spaces, which allows the algorithm to search much narrowed but
   promising solution spaces in a more efficient way. (3) The new algorithm
   modifies the traditional genetic crossover and mutation operators to
   incorporate the gene dependency in the evolutionary procedure. (4) The
   new algorithm proposes a new genetic operator, self-evolution, to
   simulate the growth procedure of an individual in nature and use it for
   guided improvements of individuals. The new genetic algorithm design is
   proven very effective and robust in various numerical tests, compared to
   the integer programming algorithm and the canonical genetic algorithm.
   When the integer programming algorithm is unable to solve the
   large-scale problem instances or cannot provide good solutions in
   acceptable times, and the canonical genetic algorithm is incapable of
   handling the complex constraints of these instances, the new genetic
   algorithm obtains the optimal or close-to-optimal solutions within
   seconds for instances as large as 84 million integer variables and 82
   thousand constraints. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A new power system transient stability assessment method based on Type-2
   fuzzy neural network estimation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{71-87}},

Abstract = {{Transient stability assessment (TSA) of large power systems by the
   conventional method is a time consuming task. For each disturbance many
   nonlinear equations should be solved that makes the problem too complex
   and will lead to delayed decisions in providing the necessary control
   signals for controlling the system. Nowadays new methods which are
   devise artificial intelligence techniques are frequently used for TSA
   problem instead of traditional methods. Unfortunately these methods are
   suffering from uncertainty in input measurements. Therefore, there is a
   necessity to develop a reliable and fast online TSA to analyze the
   stability status of power systems when exposed to credible disturbances.
   We propose a direct method based on Type-2 fuzzy neural network for TSA
   problem. The Type-2 fuzzy logic can properly handle the uncertainty
   which is exist in the measurement of power system parameters. On the
   other hand a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network (NN) has expert
   knowledge and learning capability. The proposed hybrid method combines
   both of these capabilities to achieve an accurate estimation of critical
   clearing time (CCT). The CCT is an index of TSA in power systems. The
   Type-2 fuzzy NN is trained by fast resilient back-propagation algorithm.
   Also, in order to the proposed approach become scalable in a large power
   system, a NN based sensitivity analysis method is employed to select
   more effective input data. Moreover, In order to verify the performance
   of the proposed Type-2 fuzzy NN based method, it has been compared with
   a MLP NN method. Both of the methods are applied to the IEEE standard
   New England 10-machine 39-bus test system. The simulation results show
   the effectiveness of the proposed method in compare to the frequently
   used MLP NN based method in terms of accuracy and computational cost of
   CCT estimation for sample fault scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Neuro-evolutionary approaches to power system harmonics estimation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{212-220}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on exploiting two computational intelligence
   techniques such as artificial neural network and evolutionary
   computation techniques in estimation of harmonics in power system.
   Accurate estimation of harmonics in distorted power system
   current/voltage signal is essential to effectively design filters for
   eliminating harmonics. No standard design is available for handling of
   local minima and training of NN but Evolutionary Computation (EC)
   techniques are capable of resolving local minima. Neural Network and
   Evolutionary Computing (Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO)) are
   combined to achieve accurate estimation of different harmonics
   components of a distorted power system signal. First estimation of
   unknown parameters are carried out using BFO, then optimized output of
   BFO are taken as initial values of the unknown parameters for Adaline.
   Amplitude and phase of fundamental and harmonics components are
   determined from final updated values of unknown parameters using
   Adaline. This Adaline based Bacterial Foraging Optimization
   (Adaline-BFO) hybrid estimation algorithm addresses the problems of slow
   convergence and reduction of time generation of off-springs happening in
   Genetic Algorithm (GA), and to avoid local minima in Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO). The proposed Adaline-BFO algorithm has been applied
   for estimation of harmonics of the voltage obtained across the inverter
   terminals of a prototype Photovoltaic (PV) system. From the obtained
   results, it is confirmed that the proposed Adaline-BFO algorithm
   provides superior estimation performance in terms of improvement in \%
   error in estimation, processing time in computation and performance in
   presence of inter and sub-harmonic components when compared with the
   Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Kalman Filter (KF) and BFO algorithms.

Abstract = {{Transient stability constrained optimal power flow (TSCOPF) is an
   important tool for power system planning and operation. In the paper, a
   discontinuous non-convex TSCOPF model with many minima is proposed to

   challenging discontinuous non-convex problem. Four comprehensive case

Abstract = {{Ant Colony Extended (ACE) is a novel algorithm belonging to the general

   the number of each kind of ant during the searching process. In
   addition, ACE does not employ the construction graph usually employed by
   classical ACO algorithms. Instead, the search is performed using a state
   space exploration approach. This paper studies the performance of ACE in
   the context of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classical
   combinatorial optimisation problem. The results are compared with the
   results of two well known ACO algorithms: ACS and MMAS. ACE shows better
   performance than ACS and MMAS in almost every TSP tested instance. (C)

Abstract = {{Security information and event management (SIEM) is considered to be a
   promising paradigm to reconcile traditional intrusion detection
   processes along with most recent advances on artificial intelligence
   techniques in providing automatic and self-adaptive systems. However,
   classic management-related flaws still persist, e.g. the fusion of large
   amounts of security events reported from many heterogeneous systems,
   whilst novel intriguing challenges arise specially when dealing with the
   adaptation to newly encountered and multi-step attacks. In this article,
   we provide SIEM correlation with self-adaptation capabilities to
   optimize and significantly reduce the intervention of operators. In
   particular, our enhanced correlation engine automatically learns and
   produces correlation rules based on the context for different types of
   multi-step attacks using genetic programming. The context is considered
   as the knowledge and reasoning, not only acquired by a human expert but
   also inferred by our system, which assist in the identification and
   fusion of events. In this regard, a number of artificial neural networks
   are trained to classify events according to the corresponding context
   established for the attack. Experimentation is conducted on a real
   deployment within OSSIM to validate our proposal. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Modeling time and valuation in structured argumentation frameworks}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{290}},
Pages = {{22-44}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Temporal Argumentation Frameworks (TAF) represent a recent extension of
   Dung's abstract argumentation frameworks that consider the temporal
   availability of arguments. In a TAF, arguments are valid during specific
   time intervals, called availability intervals, while the attack relation
   of the framework remains static and permanent in time; thus, in general,
   when identifying the set of acceptable arguments, the outcome associated
   with a TAF will vary in time. We introduce an extension of TAF, called
   Extended Temporal Argumentation Framework (E-TAF), adding the capability
   of modeling the temporal availability of attacks among arguments, thus
   modeling special features of arguments varying over time and the
   possibility that attacks are only available in a given time interval.
   E-TAF will be enriched by considering Structured Abstract Argumentation,
   using Dynamic Argumentation Frameworks. The resulting framework,
   E-TAF{*}, provides a suitable model for different time-dependent issues
   satisfying properties and equivalence results that permit to contrast
   the expressivity of E-TAF and E-TAF with argumentation based on abstract
   frameworks. Thus, the main contribution here is to provide an enhanced
   framework for modeling special features of argumentation varying over
   time, which are relevant in many real-world situations. The proposal
   aims at advancing in the integration of time and valuation in the
   context of argumentation systems as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The ability of certain organisms to completely regenerate lost limbs is
   a fascinating process, far from solved. Despite the extraordinary
   published efforts during the past centuries of scientists performing
   amputations, transplantations and molecular experiments, no mechanistic
   model exists yet that can completely explain patterning during the limb
   regeneration process. The lack of a centralized repository to enable the
   efficient mining of this huge dataset is hindering the discovery of
   comprehensive models of limb regeneration. Here, we introduce Limbform
   (Limb formalization), a centralized database of published limb
   regeneration experiments. In contrast to natural language or text-based
   ontologies, Limbform is based on a functional ontology using
   mathematical graphs to represent unambiguously limb phenotypes and
   manipulation procedures. The centralized database currently contains
   >800 published limb regeneration experiments comprising many model
   organisms, including salamanders, frogs, insects, crustaceans and
   arachnids. The database represents an extraordinary resource for mining
   the existing knowledge of functional data in this field; furthermore,
   its mathematical nature based on a functional ontology will pave the way
   for artificial intelligence tools applied to the discovery of the
   sought-after comprehensive limb regeneration models.}},

Abstract = {{The diagnosis of incipient fault is important for power transformer
   condition monitoring. Incipient faults are monitored by conventional and
   artificial intelligence based models. Key gases, percentage value of
   gases, and ratio of the Doernenburg, Roger, IEC methods are input
   variables to artificial intelligence models, which affects the accuracy
   of incipient fault diagnosis, so selection of the most influencing
   relevant input variable is an important research area. With this main
   objective, Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis software is
   applied to 360 simulated samples having different operating lives to
   find the most influencing input parameters for incipient fault diagnosis
   in the gene expression programming model. The Waikato Environment for
   Knowledge Analysis identifies\%C2H2,\%C2H4,\%CH4, C2H6/C2H2, C2H2/C2H4,
   CH4/H-2, C2H4/C2H6, and C2H2/CH4 as the most relevant input variables in
   incipient fault diagnosis, and it is used for fault diagnosis using
   different artificial intelligence methods, i.e., artificial neural
   networks, fuzzy logic, support vector machines, and gene expression
   programming. The compared results shows that gene expression programming
   gives better results than the artificial neural network, fuzzy logic,
   and support vector machine with accuracy variation from 98.15 to 100\%,
   proving the gene expression programming method can be used in
   transformer fault diagnosis research.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the application of computational intelligence in pulsed
   photoacoustics is discussed. Feedforward multilayer perception networks
   are applied for real-time simultaneous determination of the laser beam
   spatial profile and vibrational-to-translational relaxation time of the
   polyatomic molecules in gases. Networks are trained and tested with
   theoretical data adjusted for a given experimental set-up. Genetic
   optimization has been used for calculation of the same parameters,
   fitting the photoacoustic signals with a different number of
   generations. Observed benefits from the application of computational
   intelligence in pulsed photoacoustics and advantages over previously
   developed methods are discussed, such as real-time operation, high
   precision and the possibility of finding solutions in a wide range of
   parameters, similar to in experimental conditions. In addition, the
   applicability for practical uses, such as the realtime in situ
   measurements of atmospheric pollutants, along with possible further

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{26-36}},

Abstract = {{The challenging timeline for DARPA's Orbital Express mission demanded a
   flexible, responsive, and (above all) safe approach to mission planning.
   Mission planning for space is challenging because of the mixture of
   goals and constraints. Every space mission tries to squeeze all of the
   capacity possible out of the spacecraft. For Orbital Express, this means
   performing as many experiments as possible, while still keeping the
   spacecraft safe. Keeping the spacecraft safe can be very challenging
   because we need to maintain the correct thermal environment (or
   batteries might freeze), we need to avoid pointing cameras and sensitive
   sensors at the sun, we need to keep the spacecraft batteries charged,
   and we need to keep the two spacecraft from colliding ... made more
   difficult as only one of the spacecraft had thrusters.
   Because the mission was a technology demonstration, pertinent planning
   information was learned during actual mission execution. For example, we
   didn't know for certain how long it would take to transfer propellant
   from one spacecraft to the other, although this was a primary mission
   goal. The only way to find out was to perform the task and monitor how
   long it actually took. This information led to amendments to procedures,
   which led to changes in the mission plan. In general, we used the ASPEN
   planner scheduler to generate and validate the mission plans. ASPEN is a
   planning system that allows us to enter all of the spacecraft
   constraints, the resources, the communications windows, and our
   objectives. ASPEN then could automatically plan our day. We enhanced
   ASPEN to enable it to reason about uncertainty. We also developed a
   model generator that would read the text of a procedure and translate it
   into an ASPEN model. Note that a model is the input to ASPEN that
   describes constraints, resources, and activities. These technologies had
   a significant impact on the success of the Orbital Express mission.
   Finally, we formulated a technique for converting procedural information
   to declarative information by transforming procedures into models of
   hierarchical task networks (HTNs). The impact of this effort on the
   mission was a significant reduction in (1) the execution time of the
   mission, (2) the daily staff required to produce plans, and (3) planning
   errors. Not a single misconfigured command was sent during operations.}},

Abstract = {{Power flow calculation is the most used procedure in electrical power
   systems. Generally, most of optimization problems in electric power
   systems need a steady state analysis to evaluate the objective function.
   Especially, those optimization problems that make use of artificial
   intelligence techniques, where, due to the high number of iterations,
   the power flow calculation has a crucial role. In these cases, the
   method used for solving the power flow must be fast and accurate at the
   same time. This paper presents an approximate power flow solution method
   to solve distribution systems. The proposed method is based on current
   mismatch equations. The system of obtained equations cannot be presented
   as a set of linear complex equations. So, a simplification is introduced
   in this paper in order to express the system by a set of linear complex
   equations instead of a double set of linear real equations. Regarding
   the topology of the network, the proposed method is valid for both
   radial and mesh distribution systems. Finally, so as to demonstrate the
   validity and the effectiveness of the proposed method, a set of test
   distribution systems obtained from the technical literature have been
   used to test it.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrothermal Power Systems Operation Planning (HPSOP) aims to define the
   generation strategy for each individual power plant which represents the
   minimal overall operational cost along the planning period. This is a
   challenge for the energy sector managers, because it is a large
   stochastic optimization problem, coupled in time (dynamic) and in space
   (interconnected). The objective function is nonlinear, not convex and
   inseparable. Classical techniques present difficulties to solve the
   HPSOP problem due to its complexity. Thus, improvements in the
   traditional techniques of nonlinear optimization or the development of
   alternative ones are essential to the HPSOP. This paper presents two
   artificial intelligence techniques: Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colony
   Optimization Algorithms. Both techniques were applied to a test scenario
   with two hydroelectric power plants from the Brazilian power system and
   they have demonstrated good results and performance when compared with
   the optimization techniques traditionally used for HPSOP. It is valuable
   to note that the optimization based on artificial intelligence
   techniques makes use of the actual operational characteristics of the
   power plants without the simplifications required by the traditional
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{While modeling interactions using social commitments provides a
   fundamental basis for capturing flexible and declarative interactions
   and helps in addressing the challenge of ensuring compliance with
   specifications, the designers of the system cannot guarantee that an
   agent complies with its commitments as it is supposed to, or at least an
   agent doesn't want to violate its commitments. They may still wish to
   develop efficient and scalable algorithms by which model checking
   conditional commitments, a natural and universal frame of social
   commitments, is feasible at design time. However, distinguishing between
   different but related types of conditional commitments, and developing
   dedicated algorithms to tackle the problem of model checking conditional
   commitments, is still an active research topic. In this article, we
   develop the temporal logic CTLcc that extends Computation Tree Logic
   (CTL) with new modalities which allow representing and reasoning about
   two types of communicating conditional commitments and their
   fulfillments using the formalism of interpreted systems. We introduce a
   set of rules to reason about conditional commitments and their
   fulfillments. The verification technique is based on developing a new
   symbolic model checking algorithm to address this verification problem.
   We analyze the computational complexity and present the full
   implementation of the developed algorithm on top of the MCMAS model
   checker. We also evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness and scalability
   by verifying the compliance of the NetBill protocol, taken from the
   business domain, and the process of breast cancer diagnosis and
   treatment, taken from the health-care domain, with specifications
   expressed in CTLcc. We finally compare the experimental results with
   existing proposals.

   games, without having to deal with control structures. We show how the

Abstract = {{Domain knowledge for various decision-making activities of Software
   Engineering (SE) is rarely available in a structured or well-formalised
   form. Owing to lack of the well-informed knowledge, decision making for
   different kinds of predictions and estimations in SE domain is a
   challenge. Maintenance and elicitation of domain knowledge is an
   overwhelming task and causes the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Most
   of the artificial intelligence techniques of prediction and estimation
   do not work in absence of complete and structured knowledge. Case-based
   reasoning (CBR) is a lazy learning paradigm of artificial intelligence
   which takes care of this challenge and helps to reduce the knowledge
   availability bottleneck. This technique exploits the similar experience
   of past which may be available in unstructured form, and improves its
   learning curve with passage of time. In literature, CBR has been
   successfully applied in various areas of SE, but there is lack of single
   systematic panoramic picture which might have highlighted the potential
   research questions in this direction. In this study, the author has
   presented a comprehensive and panoramic systematic mapping study of

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Assigning newly reported bugs to project developers is a time-consuming
   and tedious task for triagers using the traditional manual bug triage
   process. Previous efforts for creating automatic bug assignment systems
   use machine learning and information-retrieval techniques. These
   approaches commonly use tf-idf, a statistical computation technique for
   weighting terms based on term frequency. However, tf-idf does not
   consider the metadata, such as the time frame at which a term was used,
   when calculating the weight of the terms. This study proposes an
   alternate term-weighting technique to improve the accuracy of automatic
   bug assignment approaches that use a term-weighting technique. This
   technique includes the use of metadata in addition to the statistical
   computation to calculate the term weights. Moreover, it restricts the
   set of terms used to only nouns. It was found that when using only nouns
   and the proposed term-weighting technique, the accuracy of an automatic
   bug assignment approach improves from 12 to 49\% over tf-idf for three

Abstract = {{This paper describes an automated tabu search based method for drawing
   general graph layouts with straight lines. To our knowledge, this is the
   first time tabu methods have been applied to graph drawing. We
   formulated the task as a multi-criteria optimization problem with a
   number of metrics which are used in a weighted fitness function to
   measure the aesthetic quality of the graph layout. The main goal of this
   work is to speed up the graph layout process without sacrificing layout
   quality. To achieve this, we use a tabu search based method that goes
   through a predefined number of iterations to minimize the value of the
   fitness function. Tabu search always chooses the best solution in the
   neighbourhood. This may lead to cycling, so a tabu list is used to store
   moves that are not permitted, meaning that the algorithm does not choose
   previous solutions for a set period of time. We evaluate the method
   according to the time spent to draw a graph and the quality of the drawn
   graphs. We give experimental results applied on random graphs and we
   provide statistical evidence that our method outperforms a fast
   search-based drawing method (hill climbing) in execution time while it
   produces comparably good graph layouts. We also demonstrate the method
   on real world graph datasets to show that we can reproduce similar
   results in a real world setting. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   laboratories. Over the preceding years, there has been a variety of
   research undertaken in relation to the volume challenge. Solutions posed
   range from data mining, data reduction, increased processing power,
   distributed processing, artificial intelligence, and other innovative
   methods. This paper surveys the published research and the proposed
   solutions. It is concluded that there remains a need for further
   research with a focus on real world applicability of a method or methods
   to address the digital forensic data volume challenge. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Phased antenna array design is one of the most important electromagnetic
   optimization problems. This research combined the Taguchi method and
   artificial intelligence methods, used them as the prediction tool in
   designing parameters for the communication system, and then constructed
   a set of the optimal parameter analysis flow and steps. In this paper,
   we present an application of artificial neural networks in the
   electromagnetic domain. We particularly look at the multilayer
   perceptron network, which has been the most used of artificial neural
   networks architectures both in the electromagnetic domain and in the
   Taguchi optimization technique and describes the Taguchi method to
   optimize the excitations elements of the linear array to produce a
   radiation pattern with minimum side lobe level and null placement
   control. This paper investigates how the implementation of the signal
   processing in hardware affects the performance of the adaptive array
   antenna. The investigation is confined to uplink or receive antenna
   array only. Results of a prototype of antenna array with feeding values
   designed using the proposed techniques are also presented. Copyright (c)

Volume = {{158}},

Abstract = {{One of the key factors of a successfully implemented mixed-model line
   system is considering model sequencing problem as well as the line
   balancing problem. In the literature, there are many studies, which
   consider these two tightly interrelated problems individually. However,
   we integrate the model sequencing problem in the line balancing
   procedure to obtain a more efficient solution for the problem of
   Simultaneous Balancing and Sequencing of Mixed-Model Parallel Two-Sided
   Assembly Lines. A mathematical model is developed to present the problem
   and a novel agent based ant colony optimisation approach is proposed as
   the solution method. Different agents interact with each other to find a
   near optimal solution for the problem. Each ant selects a random
   behaviour from a predefined list of heuristics and builds a solution
   using this behaviour as a local search rule along with the pheromone
   value. Different cycle times are allowed for different two-sided lines
   located in parallel to each other and this yields a complex problem
   where different production cycles need to be considered to build a
   feasible solution. The performance of the proposed approach is tested
   through a set of test cases. Experimental results indicate that
   considering model sequencing problem with the line balancing problem
   together helps minimise line length and total number of required
   workstations. Also, it is found that the proposed approach outperforms
   other three heuristics tested. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Smart Fault Location for Smart Grid Operation Using RTUs and

Journal = {{IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The smart grid aims to improve the quality and reliability of power at
   the generation, transmission, and distribution levels. The transmission
   lines can be considered the arteries of the power system, as they carry
   power over long distances and are exposed to difficult terrain.
   Transmission line protection philosophy is undergoing a change of
   paradigm with the advent of digital relays and high-speed broadband
   communication with the global positioning system (GPS). This paper
   explores the possibility of transmission line protection for a
   multigenerator system using wavelet multiresolution analysis (MRA) and
   computational intelligence techniques in conjunction with GPS. The
   inputs for the wavelet transform are the synchronized currents measured
   from remote telemetry units (RTUs) using GPS technology on different
   buses. The smart location technique uses a wavelet MRA technique to
   extract the features of the transient current signals based on the
   harmonics generated at the instant of occurrence of faults due to the
   abrupt changes of currents in a three-phase transmission line. These
   extracted features, with such computational intelligence techniques as
   an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural
   network (ANN), lead the grid toward smarter strategies for locating the
   fault distance. A comparative study establishes the superiority of ANFIS
   over ANNs for more accurate and reliable smart fault location.
   Furthermore, the efficacy of the proposed method is validated through a
   Monte Carlo simulation to incorporate the stochastic (random) nature of
   fault occurrence in a real-time transmission line. The most significant
   contribution of this paper is that the proposed smart location technique
   is immune to the effects of the fault inception angle (FIA), fault
   impedance, fault distance, and power angle. The results contained in
   this paper validate the use of the proposed algorithm for the real-time
   smart grid operation of transmission lines.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1012-1023}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{One very fertile domain of applied Artificial Intelligence is constraint
   solving technologies. Especially, constraint networks that concern
   problems that can be represented using discrete variables, together with
   constraints on allowed instantiation values for these variables. Every
   solution to a constraint network must satisfy every constraint. When no
   solution exists, the user might want to know the actual reasons leading
   to the absence of global solution. In this respect, extracting MUCs
   (Minimal Unsatisfiable Cores) from an unsatisfiable constraint network
   is a useful process when causes of unsatisfiability must be understood
   so that the network can be re-engineered and relaxed to become
   satisfiable. Despite bad worst-case computational complexity results,
   various MUC-finding approaches that appear tractable for many real-life
   instances have been proposed. Many of them are based on the successive
   identification of so-called transition constraints. In this respect, we
   show how local search can be used to possibly extract additional
   transition constraints at each main iteration step. In the general
   constraint networks setting, the approach is shown to outperform a
   technique based on a form of model rotation imported from the
   SAT-related technology and that also exhibits additional transition
   constraints. Our extensive computational experimentations show that this
   enhancement also boosts the performance of state-of-the-art
   DC(WCORE)-like MUC extractors.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of context-aware computing in understanding social
   signals gave a rise to a new emerging domain, called social signal

   multimodal databases containing the descriptors of social context and
   behaviors, such as situational environment, roles and gender of human
   participants. In the recent paper SSP community has emphasized how
   current research lacks of the adequate data, for the greatest part
   because acquisition and annotation of large multimodal datasets are
   time- and resource-consuming for the researchers. This paper aims to
   collect the existing work in this scope and to deliver the key aspects
   and clear directions for managing the multimodal behavior data. It
   reviews some of the existing databases, gives their important
   characteristics and draws the most important tools and methods conducted
   in capturing and managing social behavior signals. Summarizing the
   relevant findings it also addresses the existing issues and proposes
   fundamental topics that need to be investigated in the future research.}},

Abstract = {{AFSA (artificial fish-swarm algorithm) is one of the best methods of

   behaviors. Searching for food, immigration and dealing with dangers all
   happen in a social form and interactions between all fish in a group

   provide a solution to the shortcomings of clinical guidelines. Among the
   topics addressed by this paper are expert systems, case-based reasoning,
   medical ontologies and reasoning under uncertainty, with a special focus
   on methodologies for assessing quality of information when managing
   incomplete information. Finally, an analysis is made of the fundamental
   requirements of a guideline model and the importance that standard
   terminologies and models for clinical data have in the semantic and
   syntactic interoperability between a guideline execution engine and the
   software tools used in clinical settings. It is also proposed a line of
   research that includes the development of an ontology for clinical
   practice guidelines and a decision model for a guideline-based expert
   system that manages non-compliance with clinical guidelines and
   uncertainty.}},

Title = {{Stepwise approach for the evolution of generalized genetic programming
   model in prediction of surface finish of the turning process}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{16-27}},

Abstract = {{Due to the complexity and uncertainty in the process, the soft computing
   methods such as regression analysis, neural networks (ANN), support
   vector regression (SVR), fuzzy logic and multi-gene genetic programming
   (MGGP) are preferred over physics-based models for predicting the
   process performance. The model participating in the evolutionary stage
   of the MGGP method is a linear weighted sum of several genes (model
   trees) regressed using the least squares method. In this combination
   mechanism, the occurrence of gene of lower performance in the MGGP model
   can degrade its performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a
   modified-MGGP (M-MGGP) method using a stepwise regression approach such
   that the genes of lower performance are eliminated and only the high
   performing genes are combined. In this work, the M-MGGP method is
   applied in modelling the surface roughness in the turning of hardened
   AISI H11 steel. The results show that the M-MGGP model produces better
   performance than those of MGGP, SVR and ANN. In addition, when compared
   to that of MGGP method, the models formed from the M-MGGP method are of
   smaller size. Further, the parametric and sensitivity analysis conducted
   validates the robustness of our proposed model and is proved to capture
   the dynamics of the turning phenomenon of AISI H11 steel by unveiling
   dominant input process parameters and the hidden non-linear
   relationships. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the implementation of a novel multi-class diagnostic
   technique for the detection and identification of faults based on an
   approach called logical analysis of data (LAD). LAD is a datamining,
   artificial intelligence approach that is based on pattern recognition.
   In the context of condition based maintenance (CBM), historical data
   containing condition indices and the state of the machine are the inputs
   to LAD. After training and testing phases, LAD generates patterns that
   characterize the faulty states according to the type of fault, and
   differentiate between these states and the normal state. These patterns
   are found by solving a mixed 0-1 integer linear programming problem.
   They are then used to detect and to identify a future unknown state of
   equipment. The diagnostic technique has already been tested on several
   known machine learning datasets. The results proved that the performance
   of this technique is comparable to other conventional approaches, such
   as neural network and support vector machine, with the added advantage
   of the clear interpretability of the generated patterns, which are rules
   characterizing the faults' types. To demonstrate its merit in fault
   diagnosis, the technique is used in the detection and identification of
   faults in power transformers using dissolved gas analysis data. The
   paper reaches the conclusion that the multi-class LAD based fault
   detection and identification is a promising diagnostic approach in CBM.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, stochastic techniques have been developed to solve the
   2-dimensional Bratu equations with the help of feed-forward artificial
   neural networks, optimized with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and
   sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithms. A hybrid of the above
   two algorithms, referred to as the PSO-SQP method is also studied. The
   original 2-dimensional equations are solved by first transforming them
   into equivalent one-dimensional boundary value problems (BVPs). These
   are then modeled using neural networks. The optimization problem for
   training the weights of the network has been addressed using particle
   swarm techniques for global search, integrated with an SQP method for
   rapid local convergence. The methodology is evaluated by applying on
   three different test cases of BVPs for the Bratu equations. Monte Carlo
   simulations and extensive analyses are carried out to validate the
   accuracy, convergence and effectiveness of the schemes. A comparative
   study of proposed results is made with available exact solution, as well

Abstract = {{In Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP), process parameters selection
   for the given manufacturing feature is the final activity and it is the
   key area for research and development. In this work, an attempt has been
   made to optimize parameters for micro end-milling operation as a part of
   CAPP system development for micromachining processes using Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) approach. Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been found to be
   the robust and efficient tool to solve nonlinear optimization problems
   involved in process planning. Microfeatures of size 0.7 and 1 mm are
   considered and polymethyl methacrylate is chosen as the work material
   due to its potential application in microparts fabrication. Initially,
   experimental investigation has been carried out to analyze the impact of
   process conditions such as spindle speed and feed rate on surface
   roughness and machining time. Further multiobjective optimization for
   minimization of responses is carried out using GA. Finally, confirmation
   experiments are carried out to validate the accuracy of GA results. The
   optimized process parameters are stored in the database and it ensures
   foolproof parameters for micro end-milling operation for CAPP
   applications apart from manuals and catalogues. The proposed approach
   can be repeated for various other end mill features and for different
   work and tool material combination to ensure a complete parameters

Abstract = {{Uncertainty is commonly encountered in such problems as the stability
   inference of slopes in earth science and geotechnical engineering. This
   uncertainty can be approached by the artificial intelligence techniques
   and experts systems. This paper presents the adaptive relevance vector
   machine (ARVM) for stability inference of soil slopes. Based on failure
   mechanisms and due to data availability, the stability inference here is
   realized according to the three categories of slope parameters: (1)
   geomaterial parameters, (2) slope geometry parameters, and (3) the pore
   pressure coefficient R (u) . A database of dozens of slope cases is
   collected to reasonably execute the stability inference. Then, the ARVM
   is introduced to approach the problem. Some cases in the database are
   used to train the ARVM model so that an optimized ARVM model can be
   obtained. Some other cases are then used to test the inference ability
   of the optimized model. Four models obtained by different numbers of
   cases are compared to show possible effects of dataset size. Also, the
   sensitivity of the ARVM parameters is investigated. The results show
   that the width hyper-parameter has apparent effects on the performance
   of the ARVMs, and the kernel type as well as the dataset size can result
   in different optimal hyper-parameter values. Meanwhile, the ARVM is
   compared to other techniques such as the generalized regression neural
   network and the support vector machines (SVM) for the stability
   inference of the slope cases by the inference accuracy function. The
   results suggest that the ARVMs have satisfactory generalization ability
   and perform better than the simple SVM and the applied neural networks.}},

   general fall into three areas: (1) social impairment; (2) communication
   difficulties; and, (3) repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. This paper
   presents a method and an infrastructure for the detection of the
   stereotyped motion disorders of patients with ASD. The method adopts
   Artificial Intelligence techniques for the identification of stereotyped
   motion disorders and the Situation-Awareness paradigm for the reduction
   of misclassifications and the extraction of further information useful
   for clinicians. Signals caught by accelerometers are pre-processed to
   obtain features that, in turn, are passed to the classifier that
   classifies the current temporal frame in order to detect stereotyped
   motions. Once a stereotyped motion is detected, events are generated for
   intelligent situation-aware components, which collect information
   related to the frequency and period of the day of the disorders, and
   help also to reduce false positives and misclassifications by verifying
   spatio-temporal constraints. Quantitatively, the off-line classifier has
   shown an accuracy of over 99\%; whereas the on-line classifier has an
   accuracy of 92\%. The research activity has been conducted in
   cooperation with clinicians of the Department of Child Psychiatry at the
   Children's Hospital Santobon-o-Pausilipon in Naples, a prototype is
   deployed and tested at the hospital. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel quasi-oppositional teaching learning based
   optimization (QOTLBO) methodology in order to find the optimal location
   of distributed generator to simultaneously optimize power loss, voltage
   stability index and voltage deviation of radial distribution network.
   The basic disadvantage of the original teaching learning based
   optimization (TLBO) algorithm is that it gives a near optimal solution
   rather than an optimal one in a limited iteration cycles. In this paper,
   opposition based learning (OBL) and quasi OBL concepts are introduced in
   original TLBO algorithm for improving the convergence speed and
   simulation results of TLBO. In order to show the effectiveness and
   superiority, the proposed algorithms are tested on 33-bus, 69-bus and
   118-bus radial distribution networks. The simulation results of the
   proposed methods are compared with those obtained by other artificial
   intelligence techniques like GA/PSO, GA, PSO and loss sensitivity factor
   simulated annealing (LSFSA). The results show that the QOTLBO surpasses
   the other techniques in terms of solution quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   study of topic importance in Requirements Engineering elicitation
   interviews}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{61-81}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Interviewing stakeholders is a way to elicit information about
   requirements for a system-to-be. A difficulty when preparing such
   elicitation interviews is to select the topics to discuss, so as to
   avoid missing important information. Stakeholders may spontaneously
   share information on some topics, but remain silent on others, unless
   asked explicitly. We propose the Elicitation Topic Map (ETM) to help
   engineers in preparing interviews. ETM is a diagram showing topics that
   may be discussed during interviews, and shows how likely stakeholders
   discuss each of these topics spontaneously. If a topic is less likely to
   be discussed spontaneously, then this suggests that engineers may want
   to prepare questions on it, before the interview. ETM was produced
   through theoretical and empirical research. The theoretical part
   consisted of identifying topic sets based on a conceptual model of
   communication context, grounded in philosophy, artificial intelligence,
   and computer science. The empirical part involved interviews with
   Requirements Engineering professionals to identify the topic sets and
   topics in each set, surveys of business people in order to evaluate how
   likely they would spontaneously share information about topics, and
   evaluations of how likely students would share information about each
   topic, when asked about requirements for social network websites. (C)

Abstract = {{In adaptive neural network (NN) control, fast adaptation through
   high-gain learning rates can cause high-frequency oscillations in
   control response resulting in system instability. This study presents a
   simple adaptive NN with proportional derivative (PD) control strategy to
   achieve fast and low-frequency adaptation for a class of uncertain
   non-linear systems. Variable-gain PD control without the knowledge of
   plant bounds is proposed to semi-globally stabilise the plant, so that
   NN approximation is applicable. A low-pass filter-based modification is
   applied to the adaptive law to filter out high-frequency content, so
   that tracking performance can be safely improved by the increase of
   learning rates. The novelties of this study with respect to adaptive NN
   control are as follows: (i) semi-global practical asymptotic tracking
   can be achieved by a simple adjustment of control parameters; and (ii)
   fast and low-frequency adaptation can be obtained via high-gain learning
   rates under guaranteed system stability. Simulation studies have
   demonstrated that the proposed approach can outperform its non-filtering
   counterpart in terms of tracking accuracy, energy cost and control
   smoothness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the algorithms used to estimate the state of
   consumption of a pump based on dynamic pressure or vibrations. To create
   algorithms, the author used computational intelligence methods in the
   form of neural networks. In order to perform the analysis, data analysis
   systems were designed based on three neural networks: multilayer
   perceptron neural network (MLP), generalized regression neural network
   (GRNN) and probabilistic neural network (PNN). Processing of the input
   signal in the final result of the analysis consisted of several steps.
   First, the measurement data were preprocessed (delete constant
   component, normalization, standardization, reduction, fast Fourier
   trarnsform (FFT), etc.), and training and test sets were prepared using
   the matrices with the expected system answers. The last step was the
   analysis, consisting of design data analysis systems based on artificial
   neural networks and their learning and testing. On the basis of the
   obtained results the effectiveness of neural networks and the methods of
   pre-processing of the signals applied to approximate the state of
   consumption of the displacement pump were evaluated. Design systems were
   evaluated based on accuracy (generated error) and complexity (number of
   parameters and training time) criteria. The main contribution of the
   paper is to design and compare methods for pre-processing the signal,
   and to design and compare the effectiveness of the three neural networks
   in the diagnosis consumption of a positive displacement pump. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Nowadays, final products often encompass a certain intelligence therein
   to deal with variation or lack of precision in the sensing input data.
   This intelligence is usually acquired via the utilization of existing
   soft techniques, such as artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms
   and fuzzy control, among others. Thus, it is profitable to have
   on-the-shelf shell scalable and adaptive hardware designs that implement
   these soft techniques. This availability allows for an immediate
   embedding of any of those designs onto final products. This usually
   entails a reduced time-to-market of the product. Process control is one
   of the many applications that took advantage of the fuzzy paradigm. In
   general, controllers are embedded into the controlled device. This paper
   presents a novel design of a reconfigurable efficient parallel
   architecture to implement fuzzy controllers on hardware with almost no
   design effort for final users. The proposed architecture is herein
   proven suitable for embedding. It is customizable, so it allows the
   setup and configuration of the controller parameters, and hence its use
   for any problem application. Two fuzzy controllers that model autonomous
   car driving are implemented and their cost and performance evaluated.

Abstract = {{Having artificial agents to autonomously produce human-like behaviour is
   one of the most ambitious original goals of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   and remains an open problem nowadays. The imitation game originally
   proposed by Turing constitute a very effective method to prove the
   indistinguishability of an artificial agent. The behaviour of an agent
   is said to be indistinguishable from that of a human when observers (the
   so-called judges in the Turing test) cannot tell apart humans and
   non-human agents. Different environments, testing protocols, scopes and
   problem domains can be established to develop limited versions or
   variants of the original Turing test. In this paper we use a specific
   version of the Turing test, based on the international BotPrize
   competition, built in a First-Person Shooter video game, where both
   human players and non-player characters interact in complex virtual
   environments. Based on our past experience both in the BotPrize
   competition and other robotics and computer game AI applications we have
   developed three new more advanced controllers for believable agents: two
   based on a combination of the CERA-CRANIUM and SOAR cognitive
   architectures and other based on ADANN, a system for the automatic
   evolution and adaptation of artificial neural networks. These two new
   agents have been put to the test jointly with CCBot3, the winner of
   BotPrize 2010 competition (Arrabales et al., 2012), and have showed a
   significant improvement in the humanness ratio. Additionally, we have
   confronted all these bots to both First-person believability assessment
   (BotPrize original judging protocol) and Third-person believability
   assessment, demonstrating that the active involvement of the judge has a
   great impact in the recognition of human-like behaviour. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Several potential network structures are chosen to do a large number of
   experimental analysis, historical data is divided into training sample
   and testing sample, and the corresponding neural network model is
   established with BP learning algorithm. After checking the testing
   sample, a superior network integration model which can be applied for
   hydraulic metal structure health grade diagnosing is determined. By
   plenty of experimental tests and verification analysis, it is concluded
   that the two-hidden-layer neural network model suits hydraulic metal
   structure health diagnosing better. As for the gate health diagnosing,
   based on Bagging technology, the BP neural network integration model for
   hydraulic metal structure health diagnosing is researched and
   constructed. The analysis of the sample showed that its accuracy rate
   (78\%) is obviously better than the single neural network model(67\%).
   The BP neural network integration model will work together with the FAHP
   model the author studied, that can make the diagnosis results more
   reasonable and reliable.}},

   which the data is kept confidential even from the learner. In this local

Abstract = {{The work presented in this study aims to develop a methodological
   approach for estimating the ground resistance of several grounding
   systems, embedded in various ground enhancing compounds, using
   artificial neural networks (ANNs). The ANN training is based on field
   measurements that have been performed in Greece during last years. The
   methodology uses as input variables measurements of soil resistivity
   within various depths and of rainfall height during some periods of
   time, like last week and last month and estimates the ground resistance
   value of the tested rods, based on an ANN. This work comprises two
   scenarios in which, several ANN training algorithms are applied and an
   optimisation process is performed regarding the values of parameters,
   such as the number of neurons, the activation functions combination and
   so on. Each training algorithm is compared to the others, based on the
   coefficient of determination between the experimental and estimated
   values for the test set and the algorithm with the best results is
   highlighted for the estimation of ground resistance value, formed by the
   ground enhancing compounds under various weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue classification using computer aided diagnosis can help automated
   decision making to aid clinical diagnosis. Classification of breast
   tissue based on spectral features of impedance loci has frequently been
   done to classify malignant tissue with further requirement of more
   complex classification methodologies needed to improve the
   characterisation. In current study, tissue classification is done using
   in vivo electrical impedance data of 18 human subjects, from four
   quadrants of breast, palm, nail, arm, bicep and classified using
   algorithms involving machine learning methodologies, specifically
   support vector machines (SVMs) that are supervised learning models. They
   consist of learning algorithms based on the principal of structural risk
   minimisation. Two methodologies of SVM have been used in this study:
   with data binning and data pruning and without data binning and data
   pruning. Data binning and data pruning have improved the sensitivity of
   the SVM from 76.76 to 89.23\%, but the specificity has decreased from
   76.23 to 74.15\%. This is a pilot study towards testing the reliability
   of the developed electrical impedance measuring system and developing a
   data mining-based decision making system into an electrical impedance
   spectroscopy system, to help users (physicians) with tissue
   classification leading to reliable objective decision making.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game model to analyze the
   investment decision making process in the cyber offender-defender
   interaction and provide a quantified approach for defender to calculate
   the safety threshold to avoid the occurrence of offender-leading game.
   Then we use simulation as a workbench to discuss the adjustment of each
   parameter to the security investment threshold. Our evolutionary game
   model shows that the cyber offender-defender game can possibly reach one
   realistic stable point after a long-term evolution, which implicates a
   tied offender-defender game. We found that an offender-leading game can
   be avoided by maintaining the security investment above a safety
   threshold level determined by the system vulnerability among other
   environmental parameters such as residual risk and potential loss. Hence
   with an optimal level of security investment, the defender can lead the
   game effectively to discourage attacking attempts. Both linear and
   nonlinear simulations share similar trends and our evolutionary game
   theoretic analysis remains valid in either case.}},

Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3-4}},

Abstract = {{We consider settings were agents are faced with several possible
   opportunities and need to choose one. Each opportunity may offer a
   different utility to the agent, and determining this utility may consume
   resources. The underlying costly exploration problem is termed
   ``economic search{''}, though its essence is different from the
   traditional search notion in artificial intelligence (e. g. BFS, IDDFA,
   and A{*}), as there is no underlying combinatorial structure to the
   opportunities. We study the effects that search costs can have on
   individual and aggregate utility in distributed multi-agent
   economic-search settings. Traditionally, in such setting, search costs
   are regarded as a market inefficiency, and, as such, as something to be
   avoided or reduced to a minimum. We show, in contrast, that in many
   search settings, the introduction of search costs can actually improve
   the aggregate social welfare, or even the expected utility of each and
   every individual agent. We note that the proceeds from the search costs
   are assumed to be wasted, with no one directly benefiting from them. We
   demonstrate the benefits of search costs in both one-sided and two-sided
   search settings, using standard, classical models from economic-search
   theory. For the designers of multiagent systems, the results imply that
   deliberate (and potentially artificial) increase of search costs should
   be considered as possible means to improving the system's overall
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for
   the analysis of heart failure (HF) patients, providing various outputs
   such as an HF severity evaluation, HF-type prediction, as well as a
   management interface that compares the different patients' follow-ups.
   The whole system is composed of a part of intelligent core and of an HF
   special-purpose management tool also providing the function to act as
   interface for the artificial intelligence training and use. To implement
   the smart intelligent functions, we adopted a machine learning approach.
   In this paper, we compare the performance of a neural network (NN), a
   support vector machine, a system with fuzzy rules genetically produced,
   and a classification and regression tree and its direct evolution, which
   is the random forest, in analyzing our database. Best performances in
   both HF severity evaluation and HF-type prediction functions are
   obtained by using the random forest algorithm. The management tool
   allows the cardiologist to populate a ``supervised database{''} suitable
   for machine learning during his or her regular outpatient consultations.
   The idea comes from the fact that in literature there are a few
   databases of this type, and they are not scalable to our case.}},

Abstract = {{The distinctive features of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), including
   dynamic topology and open wireless medium, may lead to MANETs suffering
   from many security vulnerabilities. In this paper, using recent advances
   in uncertain reasoning that originated from the artificial intelligence
   community, we propose a unified trust management scheme that enhances
   the security in MANETs. In the proposed trust management scheme, the
   trust model has two components: trust from direct observation and trust
   from indirect observation. With direct observation from an observer
   node, the trust value is derived using Bayesian inference, which is a
   type of uncertain reasoning when the full probability model can be
   defined. On the other hand, with indirect observation, which is also
   called secondhand information that is obtained from neighbor nodes of
   the observer node, the trust value is derived using the Dempster-Shafer
   theory (DST), which is another type of uncertain reasoning when the
   proposition of interest can be derived by an indirect method. By
   combining these two components in the trust model, we can obtain more
   accurate trust values of the observed nodes in MANETs. We then evaluate
   our scheme under the scenario of MANET routing. Extensive simulation
   results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Specifically,
   throughput and packet delivery ratio (PDR) can be improved significantly

Abstract = {{Problem-solving software that is not-necessarily infallible is central
   to AI. Such software whose correctness and incorrectness properties are
   deducible by agents is an issue at the foundations of AI. The
   Comprehensibility Theorem, which appeared in a journal for specialists
   in formal mathematical logic, might provide a limitation concerning this
   issue and might be applicable to any agents, regardless of whether the
   agents are artificial or natural. The present article, aimed at
   researchers interested in the foundations of AI, addresses many
   questions related to that theorem, including differences between it and
   results of Godel and Turing that have sometimes played key roles in
   Minds and Machines articles. This study also suggests that-if one is
   willing to assume a thesis due to Donald Knuth-the Comprehensibility
   Theorem is the first mathematical theorem implying the impossibility of
   any AI agent or natural agent-including a not-necessarily infallible
   human agent-satisfying a rigorous and deductive interpretation of the
   self-comprehensibility challenge. Some have pointed out the difficulty
   of self-comprehensibility, even according to presumably a less rigorous
   interpretation. This includes Socrates, who considered it to be among
   the most important of intellectual tasks. Self-comprehensibility in some
   form might be essential for a kind of self-reflection useful for
   self-improvement that might enable some agents to increase their
   success. We use the methods of applied mathematics, rather than
   philosophy, although some topics considered could be of interest to
   philosophers.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial immune systems (AISs) are one of the artificial intelligence
   techniques studied a lot in recent years. AISs are based on the
   principles and mechanisms of the natural immune system. In this study,
   the clonal selection algorithm, which is used commonly in AISs, is
   modified. This algorithm is applied to job shop scheduling problems,
   which are one of the most difficult optimization problems. For applying
   application results to the optimum solution, parameter values giving the
   optimum solution are determined by analyzing the parameters in the
   algorithm. The obtained results are given in detail in the tables and
   figures. The best makespan values are reached in 7 out of 10 test
   problems (FT06, LA01, LA02, LA03, LA04, LA05, and ABZ6). Reasonable
   makespan values are reached for the remaining 3 problems (FT10, LA16,

Abstract = {{The subject of modeling and estimating of synchronous motor (SM)
   parameters is a challenge mathematically. Although effective solutions
   have been developed for nonlinear systems in artificial intelligence
   (AI)-based models, problems are faced with the application of these
   models in power circuits in real-time. One of these problems is the
   delay time resulting from a complex calculation process and thus the
   difficulties faced in the design of real-time motor driving circuits.
   Another important problem regards the difficulty in the realization of a
   complex AI-based model in microprocessor-based real-time systems. In
   this study, a new hybrid technique is developed to solve the problems in
   AI-based nonlinear modeling approaches. Through this method, the
   relationships among the motor parameters can be described in a
   linear/quadratic SM form. The most effective and modern metaheuristic
   methods are utilized in the creation of SM forms. The SM forms developed
   in this study lead to an easy design and application of the SM driver
   software. Therefore, a model that is faster, more effective, and more
   easily applicable than AI-based popular methods is developed for SMs.
   The proposed techniques can also be applied to many other industrial
   modeling problems that have nonlinear features.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a fault diagnosis methodology termed VisualBlock-Fuzzy
   Inductive Reasoning, i.e. VisualBlock-FIR, based on fuzzy and pattern
   recognition approaches is presented and applied to PEM fuel cell power

   hybridization of an artificial intelligence methodology that combines
   fuzzy approaches with well known pattern recognition techniques. To
   illustrate the potentiality of VisualBlock-FIR, a non-linear fuel cell
   simulator that has been proposed in the literature is employed. This
   simulator includes a set of five fault scenarios with some of the most
   frequent faults in fuel cell systems. The fault detection and
   identification results obtained for these scenarios are presented in
   this paper. It is remarkable that the proposed methodology compares
   favorably to the model-based methodology based on computing residuals
   while detecting and identifying all the proposed faults much more
   rapidly. Moreover, the robustness of the hybrid fault diagnosis
   methodology is also studied, showing good behavior even with a level of
   noise of 20 dB. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is a stochastic population-based
   metaheuristic designed for solving continuous optimization problems. It
   has a flexible and well-balanced mechanism for enhancing exploration and
   exploitation abilities. In this paper, we adapt the structure of GSA for
   solving the data clustering problem, the problem of grouping data into
   clusters such that the data in each cluster share a high degree of
   similarity while being very dissimilar to data from other clusters. The
   proposed algorithm, which is called Grouping GSA (GGSA), differs from
   the standard GSA in two important aspects. First, a special encoding
   scheme, called grouping encoding, is used in order to make the relevant
   structures of clustering problems become parts of solutions. Second,
   given the encoding, special GSA updating equations suitable for the
   solutions with grouping encoding are used. The performance of the
   proposed algorithm is evaluated through several benchmark datasets from
   the well-known UCI Machine Learning Repository. Its performance is
   compared with the standard GSA, the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), the
   Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the Firefly Algorithm (FA), and nine
   other well-known classical classification techniques from the
   literature. The simulation results indicate that GGSA can effectively be
   used for multivariate data clustering. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{178-194}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We propose a cognitive system that combines artificial intelligence
   techniques for planning and learning to execute tasks involving delayed
   and variable correlations between the actions executed and their
   expected effects. The system is applied to the task of controlling the
   growth of plants, where the evolution of the plant attributes strongly
   depends on different events taking place in the temporally distant past
   history of the plant. The main problem to tackle is how to efficiently
   detect these past events. This is very challenging since the inclusion
   of time could make the dimensionality of the search space extremely
   large and the collected training instances may only provide very limited
   information about the relevant combinations of events. To address this
   problem we propose a learning method that progressively identifies those
   events that are more likely to produce a sequence of changes under a
   plant treatment. Since the number of experiences is very limited
   compared to the size of the event space, we use a probabilistic estimate
   that takes into account the lack of experience to prevent biased
   estimations. Planning operators are generated from most accurately
   predicted sequences of changes. Planning and learning are integrated in
   a decision-making framework that operates without task interruptions by
   allowing a human gardener to instruct the treatments when the knowledge
   acquired so far is not enough to make a decision. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{238-261}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The challenge of measuring semantic similarity between words is to find
   a method that can simulate the thinking process of human. The use of
   computers to quantify and compare semantic similarities has become an
   important area of research in various fields, including artificial
   intelligence, knowledge management, information retrieval and natural
   language processing. The development of efficient measures for the
   computation of concept similarity is fundamental for computational
   semantics. Several computational measures rely on knowledge resources to
   quantify semantic similarity, such as the WordNet is a taxonomy. Several
   of these measures are based on taxonomical parameters to achieve the
   best expression possible for the semantics of content. This paper
   presents a new measure for quantifying the degree of the semantic
   similarity between concepts and words based on the WordNet hierarchy and
   using a number of topological parameters related to the ``is a{''}
   taxonomy. Our proposal combines, in a complementary way, the hyponyms
   and depth parameters. This measure takes the problem of fine granularity
   into account It is argued, however, that WordNet sense distinctions are
   highly fine-grained even for humans. We, therefore, propose a new method
   to quantify the hyponyms subgraph of a given concept based on depth
   distribution. Common nouns datasets (RG65, MOO and AG203), medical terms
   dataset (MED38) and verbs dataset (YP130) formed by word pairs are used
   in the assessment. We start by calculating semantic similarities and
   then compute the correlation coefficient between human judgement and
   computational measures. The results demonstrate that, compared to other
   currently available computational methods, the measure presented in this
   study yields into better levels of performance. Compared to several
   measures, it shows good accuracy covering all the pairwises of the verbs
   dataset YP130. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial potential field and fuzzy logic are efficient approaches for
   mobile robots autonomous navigation. However, both have advantages and
   drawbacks. Their integration into a common control scheme can
   significantly improve the performances of the resulting hybrid
   controller. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid approach in order
   to better exploit their advantages. The present work contributes in
   three aspects: first, the proposed control scheme integrates interval
   type-2 fuzzy logic concepts with artificial potential field concepts
   into a common framework in order to better exploit their advantages.
   Second, the proposed control scheme is a simple and realizable design
   for real-time implementation because only 15 fuzzy rules are sufficient
   to control the mobile robot. Third, the proposed control scheme is a
   synthesized design which utilizes both heuristic knowledge and the
   sampled input-output data pairs. An implementation in real-time on an
   omnidirectional mobile robot validates the effectiveness of the proposed
   control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Algae proliferate when favourable biological, chemical and physical
   conditions are present. Algal blooms within the Hawkesbury River, NSW,
   are a regular feature of seasonal cycles and develop in response to
   non-periodic disturbances. To improve the understanding of processes
   that lead to algal blooms, an autonomous buoy has been deployed (since
   2002) which has generated a high resolution, temporal data set.
   Parameters monitored at 15 min intervals include Chlorophyll-a,
   temperature (water and air), salinity and photosynthetically available
   radiation. This data set is used to configure an Artificial Neural
   Network (ANN) to predict (one, three and seven days in advance) the
   mean, 10th and 90th percentile, daily Chlorophyll-a concentrations. The
   prediction accuracy of the ANNs progressively decreased from one to
   seven days in advance. Incorporating predictive models coupled with near
   real time data sourced from automated, telemetered monitoring buoys
   enables environmental managers to implement proactive algal bloom
   management strategies. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In today's ever changing consumer driven market economy, it is
   imperative for providers to respond expeditiously to the changes

   transportation sector in which a service-oriented Group Decision Support
   System (GDSS) provides an important role in transportation enterprise to
   effectively manage and rapidly respond to the varying needs of the
   customer. In this paper, we explore the integration problem of
   service-oriented system and intelligence technology through the use of a
   GDSS. Initially, we analyze a service-oriented architecture and then,
   propose the design architecture of a service-oriented GDSS. Next, we put
   forward a general framework that integrates the intelligent techniques
   as a component into the architecture of service oriented GDSS. In
   addition, we illustrate how Artificial Intelligence techniques can
   resolve the conflicts of distributed group decisions. The paper is
   concluded by providing a number of applications in the railway
   management system that demonstrates the benefits of the utilization of a

Abstract = {{To ensure the quality of machined products at minimum cost and maximum
   effectiveness, it is crucial that selection of optimum machining
   parameters should be done when computer numerically controlled (CNC)
   machine tools technology is employed. Traditionally, experience of the
   operator plays a major role in the selection of efficient parameter
   values; however, attaining optimum ones each time by even skilled end
   users, is extremely difficult. This paper takes advantage of the
   possibilities of current computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided
   manufacturing (CAM) technology and implements a genetic algorithm for
   optimising CNC machining operations mainly for sculptured surfaces. The
   algorithm has been developed as a hosted application to a cutting-edge
   CAD/CAM system. Collaboration among applications has been achieved
   through programming for software automation by utilising the application
   programme interface of the system. The approach was implemented to a
   group of test sculptured models with different properties whilst one of
   them has been actually machined using typical resources. Results
   obtained after the implementation indicated that the methodology is
   capable of providing optimum values for process parameters on its way to
   maintain both productivity and high quality.}},

Abstract = {{In needle electromyography, general mathematical methods of pattern
   recognition and signal analysis can be used to detect motor unit
   potentials and to classify various types of muscle diseases. The goal of
   the paper is to contribute to various methods enabling discrimination of
   individuals with axonal neuropathy (a positive set) from normal cases (a
   control set) using signals acquired from muscle activities. Data from a
   control set of 104 individuals and a set of 76 patients were used to
   validate selected methods of their separation and classification.
   Different features in both the time and frequency domains were studied
   to obtain the most reliable results . This novel approach involves
   comparison of individual features based on adaptive signal thresholding,
   as well as their combination, using supervised sigmoidal neural networks
   for their classification. Specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of the
   features used to detect individuals with axonal neuropathy was analysed
   using the receiver operating characteristic curves and confusion
   analysis. An accuracy higher than 93 \% was achieved for the given sets
   of individuals and the optimal criterion values. The proposed modified
   Willison amplitude together with statistical and spectral properties of
   signal components classified individuals into sets of healthy and
   neuropathic patients by artificial neural networks with sensitivity 96.1
   \% and sufficient accuracy in the wide range of criterion values.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Over the past years, some artificial intelligence techniques like
   artificial neural networks have been widely used in the hydrological
   modeling studies. In spite of their some advantages, these techniques
   have some drawbacks including possibility of getting trapped in local
   minima, overtraining and subjectivity in the determining of model
   parameters. In the last few years, a new alternative kernel-based
   technique called a support vector machines (SVM) has been found to be
   popular in modeling studies due to its advantages over popular
   artificial intelligence techniques. In addition, the relevance vector
   machines (RVM) approach has been proposed to recast the main ideas
   behind SVM in a Bayesian context. The main purpose of this study is to
   examine the applicability and capability of the RVM on long-term flow
   prediction and to compare its performance with feed forward neural
   networks, SVM, and multiple linear regression models. Meteorological
   data (rainfall and temperature) and lagged data of rainfall were used in
   modeling application. Some mostly used statistical performance
   evaluation measures were considered to evaluate models. According to
   evaluations, RVM method provided an improvement in model performance as
   compared to other employed methods. In addition, it is an alternative
   way to popular soft computing methods for long-term flow prediction
   providing at least comparable efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a method that uses an artificial neural network
   (ANN) to mimic human decision-making about route choice in a crowded
   transportation station. Although ANN models have been developed rapidly
   and widely adopted in various fields in the last three decades, their
   application to predict human decision-making in pedestrian flows is
   limited, because the video clip technology used to collect pedestrian
   movement data in crowded conditions is still primitive. Data collection
   must be carried out manually or semi-manually, which requires extensive
   resources and is time consuming. This study adopts a semi-manual
   approach to extract data from video clips to capture the route choice
   behaviour of travellers, and then applies an ANN to mimic such
   decision-making. A prediction accuracy of 86\% (ANN model with ensemble
   approach) is achieved, which demonstrates the feasibility of applying
   the ANN approach to decision-making in pedestrian flows. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the development and validation of an optimal
   motion planning method for computer assisted surgical training. The
   context of this work is the development of new-generation systems that
   combine artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques in order
   to adjust the learning process to specific needs of a trainee, while
   preventing a trainee from the memorization of particular task settings.
   The problem described in the paper is the generation of shortest,
   collision-free trajectories for laparoscopic instrument movements in the
   rigid block world used for hand-eye coordination tasks. Optimal
   trajectories are displayed on a monitor to provide continuous visual
   guidance for optimal navigation of instruments. The key result of the
   work is a framework for the transition from surgical training systems in
   which users are dependent on predefined task settings and lack guidance
   for optimal navigation of laparoscopic instruments, to the so called
   intelligent systems that can potentially deliver the utmost flexibility
   to the learning process. A preliminary empirical evaluation of the
   developed optimal motion planning method has demonstrated the increase
   of total scores measured by total time taken to complete the task, and
   the instrument movement economy ratio. Experimentation with different
   task settings and the technical enhancement of the visual guidance are
   subjects of future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An evolutionary approach of multi-gene genetic programming (GP) is used
   to study the effects of aspect ratio, temperature, number of atomic

   REBO potential is used to obtain the engineering moduli. This data is
   then fed into the paradigm of a GP cluster comprising of genetic
   programming, which was specifically designed to formulate the explicit
   relationship of engineering moduli of graphene sheets loaded in armchair
   and zigzag directions with respect to aspect ratio, temperature, number
   of atomic planes and vacancy defects. We find that our MGGP model is
   able to model the engineering moduli of armchair and zigzag oriented
   graphene sheets well in agreement with that of experimental results. We
   also conducted sensitivity and parametric analysis to find out specific
   influence and variation of each of the input system parameters on the
   engineering moduli of armchair and zigzag graphene sheets. It was found
   that the number of defects has the most dominating influence on the
   engineering moduli of graphene sheets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The use of near-surface mounted FRP reinforcement in reinforced concrete
   structures has seen a considerable increase in recent years as a
   strengthening method. However, few simple models have been published for
   predicting the shear capacity given by this technique. In this work, two

   as a means of predicting shear strength without the need to use complex
   models is developed. Secondly, with the purpose of generating a design
   formula of simple application to evaluate the shear strength
   contribution provided by a near-surface mounted system, a
   multi-objective optimization problem is solved. It results from
   considering simultaneously the experimental results of beams with and
   without NSM-FRP reinforcement. The performance of both methodologies is
   compared with some experimental results. Sensitivity and parametric
   analyses are performed too for further evaluation of the proposed

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{283}},
Pages = {{142-152}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Modeling dynamical systems is a commonly used technique to solve
   partially observable problems in the artificial intelligence field.
   Predictive state representations (PSRs) have been proposed as an
   alternative to partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs)
   to model dynamical systems. Although POMDPs and PSRs provide general
   frameworks to solve partially observable problems, they rely heavily on
   a known and accurate model of the environment. However, in real world
   applications it is extremely difficult to build an accurate model. In
   this paper, we propose an algorithm to solve partially observable
   problems using an inaccurate PSR model which is learned from samples.
   The proposed algorithm can also improve the accuracy of the learned
   model. Given the inaccurate PSR model, the PSR state is identified
   firstly. Then the traditional Markov decision processes (MDP) techniques
   are used to solve the partially observable problem. Furthermore, the
   learned model, which may get off-track as often happens when the model
   is learned from samples, can be reset. The effectiveness of our proposed
   algorithm is demonstrated based on a standard set of POMDP test
   problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{114}},

Abstract = {{Conditional independence (CI) statements occur in several areas of
   computer science and artificial intelligence, e.g., as embedded
   multivalued dependencies in database theory, disjunctive association
   rules in data mining, and probabilistic CI statements in probability
   theory. Although, syntactically, such constraints can always be
   represented in the form I(A, B vertical bar C), with A, B, and C subsets
   of some universe S, their semantics is very dependent on their
   interpretation, and, therefore, inference rules valid under one
   interpretation need not be valid under another. However, all
   aforementioned interpretations obey the so-called semigraphoid axioms.
   In this paper, we consider the restricted case of deriving arbitrary CI
   statements from so-called saturated ones, i.e., which involve all
   elements of S. Our main result is a necessary and sufficient condition
   under which the semigraphoid axioms are also complete for such
   derivations. Finally, we apply these results to the examples mentioned
   above to show that, for these semantics, the semigraphoid axioms are
   both sound and complete for the derivation of arbitrary CI statements
   from saturated ones. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel neural network to treat natural language.
   Most of the conventional neural networks can only process sentences
   consisted of a few words, and their applications are very simple such as

   question-answering system for factoid questions. The proposed network is
   composed of three layers and one network: Sentence Layer, Knowledge
   Layer, Deep Case Layer and Dictionary Network. The input sentences are
   divided into knowledge units and stored in the Knowledge Layer. The Deep
   Case Layer plays an important role in processing the knowledge units
   properly. The Dictionary Network also plays an important role as a
   knowledge base. We have carried out several experiments and they have
   shown that the proposed neural network has superior performances as an
   associative memory and a question-answering system. Especially as a

Abstract = {{Many audio signal applications are corrupted by noise. In particular,
   adaptive filters are frequently applied to white noise reduction in
   audio. Recent work provides that there exist some insights on using an
   artificial intelligence method called artificial hydrocarbon networks
   (AHNs) for filtering audio signals. Thus, the scope of this paper is to
   design and implement a novel approach of artificial hydrocarbon networks
   on adaptive filtering for audio signals. Three experiments were
   developed. Results demonstrate that AHNs can reduce noise from audio
   signals. A comparison between the proposed algorithm and a FIR-filter is
   also provided. The short-time objective intelligibility value (STOI) and
   the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were used for evaluation. At last, the
   proposed training method for finding the parameters involved in the
   AHN-filter can also be used in other fields of application. (C) 2014

Title = {{Optimal filter design using an improved artificial bee colony algorithm}},

Abstract = {{The domain of analog filter design revolves around the selection of
   proper values of the circuit components from a possible set of values
   manufactured keeping in mind the associated cost overhead. Normal design
   procedures result in a set of values for the discrete components that do
   not match with the preferred set of values. This results in the
   selection of approximated values that cause error in the associated
   design process. An optimal solution to the design problem would include
   selection of the best possible set of components from the numerous
   possible combinations. The search procedure for such an optimal solution
   necessitates the usage of Evolutionary Computation (EC) as a potential
   tool for determining the best possible set of circuit components.
   Recently algorithms based on Swarm Intelligence (SI) have gained
   prominence due to the underlying focus on collective intelligent
   behavior. In this paper a novel hybrid variant of a swarm-based
   metaheuristics called Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is proposed
   and shall be referred to as CRbABC\_Dt (Collective Resource-based ABC
   with Decentralized tasking) and it incorporates the idea of
   decentralization of attraction from super-fit members along with
   neighborhood information and wider exploration of search space. Two
   separate filter design instances have been tested using CRbABC\_Dt
   algorithm and the results obtained are compared with several competitive
   state-of-the-art optimizing algorithms. All the components considered in
   the design are selected from standard series and the resulting deviation
   from the idealized design procedure has been investigated. Additional
   empirical experimentation has also been included based on the
   benchmarking problems proposed for the CEC 2013 Special Session \&
   Competition on Real-Parameter Single Objective Optimization. (C) 2014

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{The development of symbolic approaches to decision-making has become an
   ever-growing research line in artificial intelligence; argumentation has
   contributed to that with its unique strengths. Following this trend,
   this article proposes a general-purpose decision framework based on
   argumentation. Given a set of alternatives posed to the decision-maker,
   the framework represents the agent's preferences and knowledge by an
   epistemic component developed using possibilistic defeasible logic
   programming. The reasons by which a particular alternative is deemed
   better than another are explicitly considered in the argumentation
   process involved in warranting information from the epistemic component.
   The information warranted by the dialectical process is then used in
   decision rules that implement the agent's general decision-making
   policy. Essentially, decision rules establish patterns of behaviour of
   the agent specifying under which conditions a set of alternatives will
   be considered acceptable; moreover, a methodology for programming the
   agent's epistemic component is defined. It is demonstrated that
   programming the agent's epistemic component following this methodology
   exhibits some interesting properties with respect to the selected
   alternatives; also, when all the relevant information regarding the
   agent's preferences is specified, its choice behaviour coincides with
   respect to the optimum preference derived from a rational preference
   relation.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study of the predictive capabilities of recent advances in
   computational intelligence (CI) is presented. This study utilised the
   machine learning paradigm to evaluate the CI techniques while applying
   them to the prediction of porosity and permeability of heterogeneous

   permeability are the major petroleum reservoir properties that serve as
   indicators of reservoir quality and quantity. The results showed that
   the performance of support vector machines (SVM) and functional networks
   (FN) is competitively better than that of Type-2 fuzzy logic system
   (T2FLS) in terms of correlation coefficient. With execution time, FN and
   SVM were faster than T2FLS, which took the most time for both training
   and testing. The results also demonstrated the capability of SVM to
   handle small data sets. This work will assist artificial intelligence
   practitioners to determine the most appropriate technique to use
   especially in conditions of limited amount of data and low processing

Abstract = {{A neuro-inspired multi-chromosomal genotype for a single developmental
   neuron capable of learning and developing memory is proposed. This
   genotype is evolved so that the phenotype which changes and develops
   during an agent's lifetime (while problem-solving) gives the agent the
   capacity for learning by experience. Seven important processes of signal
   processing and neural structure development are identified from biology
   and encoded using Cartesian Genetic Programming. These chromosomes
   represent the electrical and developmental aspects of dendrites, axonal
   branches, synapses and the neuron soma. The neural morphology that
   occurs by running these chromosomes is highly dynamic. The
   dendritic/axonal branches and synaptic connections form and change in
   response to situations encountered in the learning task. The approach
   has been evaluated in the context of maze-solving and the board game of
   checkers (draughts) demonstrating interesting learning capabilities. The
   motivation underlying this research is to, ab initio, evolve genotypes
   that build phenotypes with an ability to learn.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) is one of the state-of-the-art
   swarm intelligence algorithms that is widely used for optimization
   purposes in static environments. However, numerous real-world problems
   are dynamic and uncertain, which could not be solved using static
   approaches. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, a novel
   AFSA algorithm, so called NAFSA, has been proposed in order to eliminate
   weak points of standard AFSA and increase convergence speed of the
   algorithm. Second, a multi-swarm algorithm based on NAFSA (mNAFSA) was
   presented to conquer particular challenges of dynamic environment by
   proposing several novel mechanisms including particularly modified
   multi-swarm mechanism for finding and covering potential optimum peaks
   and diversity increase mechanism which is applied after detecting an
   environment change. The proposed approaches have been evaluated on
   moving peak benchmark, which is the most prominent benchmark in this
   domain. This benchmark involves several parameters in order to simulate
   different configurations of dynamic environments. Extensive experiments
   show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms previous
   algorithms in most of the tested dynamic environments modeled by moving
   peaks benchmark. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel method for power transformer insulation
   assessment using oil characteristics. A hybrid algorithm, named as
   SMOTEBoost is implemented in the paper to improve the diagnosis accuracy
   and consistency. The SMOTEBoost can significantly enhance the
   generalization capability of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for
   transformer insulation diagnosis. This will provide important benefits
   for applying AI techniques in utility companies, i.e., an AI algorithm
   with its model built upon on a ``local{''} dataset can be utilized
   ``globally{''} to make transformer insulation diagnosis. The SMOTEBoost
   adopts Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle the
   class imbalance problem, in which data points belonging to different
   fault types or insulation conditions are unevenly distributed in the
   training dataset. By using this boosting approach for reweighting and
   grouping data points in the training dataset, the SMOTEBoost facilitates
   AI algorithms consistently attaining desirable diagnosis accuracy. To
   verify the advantages of SMOTEBoost algorithm, it is integrated with a
   number of representative AI algorithms including support vector machine
   (SVM), C4.5 decision tree, radial basis function (RBF) network and
   k-nearest neighbor (KNN) to make transformer insulation diagnosis using
   various oil characteristic datasets collected from different utility
   companies. A statistical performance comparison amongst these algorithms
   is presented in the paper.}},

Title = {{Sentic patterns: Dependency-based rules for concept-level sentiment
   analysis}},

Abstract = {{The Web is evolving through an era where the opinions of users are
   getting increasingly important and valuable. The distillation of
   knowledge from the huge amount of unstructured information on the Web
   can be a key factor for tasks such as social media marketing, branding,
   product positioning, and corporate reputation management. These online
   social data, however, remain hardly accessible to computers, as they are
   specifically meant for human consumption. The automatic analysis of
   online opinions involves a deep understanding of natural language text
   by machines, from which we are still very far. To this end,
   concept-level sentiment analysis aims to go beyond a mere word-level
   analysis of text and provide novel approaches to opinion mining and
   sentiment analysis that enable a more efficient passage from
   (unstructured) textual information to (structured) machine-processable
   data. A recent knowledge-based technology in this context is sentic
   computing, which relies on the ensemble application of common-sense
   computing and the psychology of emotions to infer the conceptual and
   affective information associated with natural language. Sentic
   computing, however, is limited by the richness of the knowledge base and
   by the fact that the bag-of-concepts model, despite more sophisticated
   than bag-of-words, misses out important discourse structure information
   that is key for properly detecting the polarity conveyed by natural
   language opinions. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm to
   concept-level sentiment analysis that merges linguistics, common-sense
   computing, and machine learning for improving the accuracy of tasks such
   as polarity detection. By allowing sentiments to flow from concept to
   concept based on the dependency relation of the input sentence, in
   particular, we achieve a better understanding of the contextual role of
   each concept within the sentence and, hence, obtain a polarity detection
   engine that outperforms state-of-the-art statistical methods. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm has been applied to many
   scientific and engineering problems for its easy of use and efficiency.
   However, the original ABC technique cannot be used in a binary search

   or BitABC, that has a similar framework to the original ABC but uses a
   bitwise operation for the movements of the employed bees and onlooker
   bees. Experiments have been carried out by comparing BitABC with three
   binary ABC variants, DisABC, normABC, and BinABC, and the most used
   binary search technique, GA, on a set of 13 selected benchmark
   functions. Results show that the proposed BitABC performs better than,
   or at least comparable to, the other algorithms in terms of the final
   solution accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Avalanche photodiode (APD) based positron emission tomography (PET)
   scanners show enhanced imaging capabilities in terms of spatial
   resolution and contrast due to the one to one coupling and size of
   individual crystal-APD detectors. However, to ensure the maximal
   performance, these PET scanners require proper calibration by qualified
   scanner operators, which can become a cumbersome task because of the
   huge number of channels they are made of. An intelligent system (IS)
   intends to alleviate this workload by enabling a diagnosis of the
   observational errors of the scanner. The IS can be broken down into four
   hierarchical blocks: parameter extraction, channel fault detection,
   prioritization and diagnosis. One of the main activities of the IS
   consists in analyzing available channel data such as: normalization
   coincidence counts and single count rates, crystal identification
   classification data, energy histograms, APD bias and noise thresholds to
   establish the channel health status that will be used to detect channel
   faults. This paper focuses on the first two blocks of the IS: parameter
   extraction and channel fault detection. The purpose of the parameter
   extraction block is to process available data on individual channels
   into parameters that are subsequently used by the fault detection block
   to generate the channel health status. To ensure extensibility, the
   channel fault detection block is divided into indicators representing
   different aspects of PET scanner performance: sensitivity, timing,
   crystal identification and energy. Some experiments on a 8 cm axial
   length LabPET scanner located at the Sherbrooke Molecular Imaging Center
   demonstrated an erroneous channel fault detection rate of 10\% (with a
   95\% confidence interval (CI) of {[}9, 11]) which is considered
   tolerable. Globally, the IS achieves a channel fault detection
   efficiency of 96\% (CI: {[}95, 97]), which proves that many faults can
   be detected automatically. Increased fault detection efficiency would be
   advantageous but, the achieved results would already benefit scanner
   operators in their maintenance task.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{674-688}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Different studies have theoretically analyzed the performance of
   artificial immune systems in the context of optimization. It has been
   noted that, in comparison with evolutionary algorithms and local search,
   hypermutations tend to be inferior on typical example functions. These
   studies have used the expected optimization time as performance
   criterion and cannot explain why artificial immune systems are popular
   in spite of these proven drawbacks. Recently, a different perspective
   for theoretical analysis has been introduced, concentrating on the
   expected performance within a fixed time frame instead of the expected
   time needed for optimization. Using this perspective we reevaluate the
   performance of somatic contiguous hypermutations and inverse
   fitness-proportional hypermutations in comparison with random local
   search on one well-known example function in which a random local search
   is known to be efficient and much more efficient than these
   hypermutations with respect to the expected optimization time. We prove
   that, depending on the choice of the initial search point,
   hypermutations can by far outperform random local search in a given time
   frame. This insight helps to explain the success of seemingly
   inefficient mutation operators in practice. Moreover, we demonstrate how
   one can benefit from these theoretically obtained insights by designing
   more efficient hybrid search heuristics.}},

Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{210-218}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Motivation: One of the important aspects of the data classification
   problem lies in making the most appropriate selection of features. The
   set of variables should be small and, at the same time, should provide
   reliable discrimination of the classes. The method for the
   discriminating power evaluation that enables a comparison between
   different sets of variables will be useful in the search for the set of
   variables.
   Results: A new approach to feature selection is presented. Two methods
   of evaluation of the data discriminating power of a feature set are
   suggested. Both of the methods implement self-organizing maps (SOMs) and
   the newly introduced exponents of the degree of data clusterization on
   the SOM. The first method is based on the comparison of intraclass and
   interclass distances on the map. Another method concerns the evaluation
   of the relative number of best matching unit's (BMUs) nearest neighbors
   of the same class. Both methods make it possible to evaluate the
   discriminating power of a feature set in cases when this set provides
   nonlinear discrimination of the classes.

   outputs. The input-output interactions have also been achieved via
   adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference technique that allows designing the
   drilling operations in an efficient, effective, and reliable way. The
   developed system has an interactive and visual interface for ease of

Abstract = {{In recent years, due to intense competition through globalization, most
   manufacturing companies have focused on increasing the added value and
   reducing the production costs of their products. Inevitably, this has
   led to the use of advanced technology to carry out manufacturing in an
   effective and efficient way. Monitoring and control of machining
   processes are becoming increasingly important for maintaining consistent
   quality in machined parts. The quality of product can be affected by
   disturbances during machining process. The paper presents a
   self-optimizing control system (SOCS) for smart machining that applies
   information science to enable next-generation quality control, in which
   the need for expensive post-process inspection is eliminated. In the
   smart machining system with SOCS, each machine is an autonomous entity.
   The machining system reacts to disturbances autonomously based on the
   reaction of each autonomous entity or the cooperation among them. In
   order to develop the SOCS, the disturbances that happened in the
   machining shop for manufacturing the clutch housing products were
   analyzed to classify them and to find out the corresponding management
   methods such as non-negotiation, negotiation, and rescheduling. To prove
   that the proposed SOCS is self-monitoring, self-adjusting as well as
   cooperation, a machining process related to tool conditions was
   considered in this paper. If the disturbance belongs to the
   non-negotiation type, for example the tool wear, the machine with SOCS
   adjusts the cutting parameters in consideration of the amount of tool
   wear to keep the quality of the machined part. In case the disturbance
   belongs to the negotiation type such as the tool wear exceeding the
   allowed limit or tool broken, ant colony inspired cooperation among
   machines is implemented to find out the most appropriate machine for
   carrying out the machining operation. The best solution is chosen based
   on the evaluation of pheromone values of the alternative machines in
   case many machines satisfy the requirements. The work of the machine in
   which the disturbance happens is performed at another machine in order
   to keep the machining system running. The experimental results prove
   that the mechanism of the proposed SOCS enables the system to adapt to
   the disturbances successfully.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an organization model for personalized didactic
   contents used in individual study environments. For many students the
   availability of contents in a general form might not be effective. A
   multilevel structure of concepts is proposed to provide different
   presentation combinations of the same content. Our work shows that it is
   possible to personalize the didactic content in order to encourage
   students, by using proximal learning patterns. These patterns are
   obtained from the analysis of the actions of students with positive
   results in the individual content organization. The system uses
   artificial intelligence techniques to reactively organize and
   personalize content. Personalization is made possible by means of an
   artificial neural network that classifies the student's profile and
   assigns it a proximal learning pattern. Expert rules are used to mediate
   and adjust the contents reactively. Experimental results indicate that
   the approach is efficient and provides the student a better use of the
   content with adaptive and reactive personalized presentation. (C) 2014

Title = {{Query-dependent metric learning for adaptive, content-based image
   browsing and retrieval}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems often incorporate a
   relevance feedback mechanism in which retrieval is adapted based on
   users identifying images as relevant or irrelevant. Such relevance
   decisions are often assumed to be category-based. However, forcing a
   user to decide upon category membership of an image, even when
   unfamiliar with a database and irrespective of context, is restrictive.
   An alternative is to obtain user feedback in the form of relative
   similarity judgments. The ability of a user to provide meaningful
   feedback depends on the interface that displays retrieved images and
   facilitates the feedback. Similarity-based 2D layouts provide context
   and can enable more efficient visual search. Motivated by these
   observations, this study describes and evaluates an interactive image
   browsing and retrieval approach based on relative similarity feedback
   obtained from 2D image layouts. It incorporates online maximal-margin
   learning to adapt the image similarity metric used to perform retrieval.
   A user starts a session by browsing a collection of images displayed in
   a 2D layout. He/she may choose a query image perceived to be similar to
   the envisioned target image. A set of images similar to the query are
   then returned. The user can then provide relational feedback and/or
   update the query image to obtain a new set of images. Algorithms for
   CBIR are often characterised empirically by simulating usage based on
   pre-defined, fixed category labels, deeming retrieved results as
   relevant if they share a category label with the query. In contrast, the
   purpose of the system in this study is to enable browsing and retrieval
   without predefined categories. Therefore evaluation is performed in a
   target-based setting by quantifying the efficiency with which target
   images are retrieved given initial queries.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The problem of link prediction has attracted considerable recent
   attention from various domains such as sociology, anthropology,
   information science, and computer sciences. In this paper, we propose a
   link prediction algorithm based on ant colony optimization. By
   exploiting the swarm intelligence, the algorithm employs artificial ants
   to travel on a logical graph. Pheromone and heuristic information are
   assigned in the edges of the logical graph. Each ant chooses its path
   according to the value of the pheromone and heuristic information on the
   edges. The paths the ants traveled are evaluated, and the pheromone
   information on each edge is updated according to the quality of the path
   it located. The pheromone on each edge is used as the final score of the
   similarity between the nodes. Experimental results on a number of real
   networks show that the algorithm improves the prediction accuracy while
   maintaining low time complexity. We also extend the method to solve the
   link prediction problem in networks with node attributes, and the
   extended method also can detect the missing or incomplete attributes of
   data. Our experimental results show that it can obtain higher quality
   results on the networks with node attributes than other algorithms.}},

   multi-objective maximization of geometric margins for a discriminant

Abstract = {{Scheduling of single machine in manufacturing systems is especially
   complex when the order arrivals are dynamic. The complexity of the
   problem increases by considering the sequence-dependent setup times and
   machine maintenance in dynamic manufacturing environment. Computational
   experiments in literature showed that even solving the static single
   machine scheduling problem without considering regular maintenance
   activities is NP-hard. Multi-agent systems, a branch of artificial

   complex problems. In this paper a collaborative multi-agent based
   optimization method is proposed for single machine scheduling problem
   with sequence-dependent setup times and maintenance constraints. The
   problem is solved under the condition of both regular and irregular
   maintenance activities. The solutions of multi-agent based approach are
   compared with some static single machine scheduling problem sets which
   are available in the literature. The method is also tested under
   real-time manufacturing environment where computational time plays a

Abstract = {{In this paper the assessment of the wave energy potential in nearshore
   coastal areas is investigated by means of artificial neural networks
   (ANNs). The performance of the ANNs is compared with in situ
   measurements and spectral numerical modelling (the conventional tool for

   buoys, one offshore and one inshore, with an hourly frequency are used
   to develop an ANN model for predicting the nearshore wave power. The
   best suited architecture was selected after assessing the performance of
   480 ANN models involving twelve different architectures. The results
   predicted by the ANN model were compared with the measured data and
   those obtained by means of the SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore)
   spectral model. The quality in the predictions of the ANN model shows
   that this type of artificial intelligence models constitutes a powerful
   tool to forecast the wave energy potential at particular coastal site
   with great accuracy, and one that overcomes some of the disadvantages of
   the conventional tools for nearshore wave power prediction. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm inspired by the foraging behaviour
   of the honey bees is one of the most popular swarm intelligence based
   optimization techniques. Quick artificial bee colony (qABC) is a new
   version of ABC algorithm which models the behaviour of onlooker bees
   more accurately and improves the performance of standard ABC in terms of
   local search ability. In this study, the qABC method is described and
   its performance is analysed depending on the neighbourhood radius, on a
   set of benchmark problems. And also some analyses about the effect of
   the parameter limit and colony size on qABC optimization are carried
   out. Moreover, the performance of qABC is compared with the state of art
   algorithms' performances. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Ambient Intelligence (Am!) paradigm envisions systems whose central
   entity is the user. AmI integrates technologies such as Artificial
   Intelligence, implicit Human Computer Interaction, and Ubiquitous
   Services. Each capability of AmI systems is oriented towards assistance
   of humans at work, in the classroom, or even at home. In consequence,
   the Awl development process usually incorporates the final user since
   the first stages. However, having users available during all this long
   process is not always possible. Agent-based social simulations where the
   users role is played by simulated entities can be used to make the Awl
   development process faster and more effective. In this scenario, the
   modelling of CMHBs (Computational Models of Human Behaviour) is a major
   challenge. To address this issue, this paper proposes a methodology
   whose main contributions are: (1) the use of domain experts' knowledge
   to create CMHBs; (2) a common methodological framework to develop CMHBs
   by combining information obtained from sensors' perceptions and experts'
   experiences; and, (3) open source tools to support this development
   paradigm. The paper also presents a full case of study in a hospital
   which illustrates: the number of recommendations made by the
   methodology; the techniques proposed (mainly the use of ontologies and
   temporal reasoning); and, the potential of the methodology to model the
   personnel in a hospital. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Intelligent fault locating in transmission lines consists of
   three main steps: feature extraction. feature selection, and utilizing a
   learning tool.
   Objective: The main objective of this paper is to propose a systematic
   approach for intelligent fault locating in transmission lines.
   Method: This paper extracts a group of candidate features by applying a
   combination of the Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) and Improved Prony
   Analysis (IPA) methods on single-ended voltage measurements. To have an
   accurate fault location estimate, useful and efficient features are
   selected among the candidate features using the regression relief
   algorithm. In this paper, performances of three regression learning
   tools including the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN),
   k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and the Random Forests (RF) in the fault
   location problem are evaluated and compared, and the best tool is
   introduced.
   Results: Numerous training and test patterns are generated through
   simulation of various fault types in an untransposed transmission line
   based on different values of fault location, fault resistance, fault
   inception angle, and magnitude and direction of load current. The
   results of evaluation using theses patterns show the high efficiency and
   accuracy of the proposed approach. For various fault types in the test
   cases, the average values of fault location estimation errors are in the
   range of 0.153-0.202\%.
   Conclusion: Besides accuracy, the proposed fault locating method is
   immune against current signal measurement errors and it does not face
   the problems and costs related to the transmitting and synchronizing
   data of both line ends. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial intelligence techniques aimed at more naturally simulating
   human comprehension fit the paradigm of multi-label classification.
   Generally, an enormous amount of high-quality multi-label data is needed
   to form a multi-label classifier. The creation of such datasets is
   usually expensive and time-consuming. A lower cost way to obtain
   multi-label datasets for use with such comprehension simulation
   techniques is to use noisy crowdsourced annotations. We propose
   incorporating label dependency into the label-generation process to
   estimate the multiple true labels for each instance given crowdsourced
   multi-label annotations. Three statistical quality control models based
   on the work of Dawid and Skene are proposed. The label-dependent DS
   (D-DS) model simply incorporates dependency relationships among all
   labels. The label pairwise DS (P-DS) model groups labels into pairs to
   prevent interference from uncorrelated labels. The Bayesian network
   label-dependent DS (ND-DS) model compactly represents label dependency
   using conditional independence properties to overcome the data sparsity
   problem. Results of two experiments, ``affect annotation for lines in
   story{''} and ``intention annotation for tweets{''}, show that (I) the
   ND-DS model most effectively handles the multi-label estimation problem
   with annotations provided by only about five workers per instance and
   that (2) the P-DS model is best if there are pairwise comparison
   relationships among the labels. To sum up, flexibly using label
   dependency to obtain multi-label datasets is a promising way to reduce
   the cost of data collection for future applications with minimal
   degradation in the quality of the results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this work, a method to enhance images based on a new artificial life

   organism, when this organism is in a certain environment and selects its

   more suitable food and eating parts of it in each iteration. The path
   that the organism travels through in the image is defined by a priori
   knowledge about the environment and how it should move in it. Here, we
   modeled the control and perception centers of the organism, as well as
   the simulation of its actions and effects on the environment. To
   demonstrate the efficiency of our method quantitative and qualitative

Abstract = {{Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a major role in modern video games by
   making them feel both more realistic and more fun to play. Game
   intelligence usually works alongside the game logic, in the background,
   invisible to the players who enjoy the resulting character behaviors,
   the adaptive gameplay, and the procedurally generated content. However,
   artificial intelligence can also have a central role and become a major
   component of the overall gameplay (as for instance in the video game
   Black \& White).
   In this paper, we define the genre of scripting video games and
   introduce Fuzzy Tactics, a video game we developed that has an
   innovative gameplay based on fuzzy logic and uses fuzzy rules as its
   core game mechanic and user interaction mechanism. In Fuzzy Tactics,
   players lead their troops into battle by specifying a set of fuzzy rules
   that determines the battle behavior of the units. Fuzzy logic is the
   only mean that players have to interact with the game and to command to
   their troops. Thus, it becomes the main game mechanic that allows us to
   (i) extend the depth of the game, (ii) keep the interaction intuitive,
   while also (iii) increasing the replayability and the educational value
   of the game. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the switching property included in their structure, half-bridge
   power electronic DC-DC converters have a nonlinear behavior and their
   controller design is accompanied with complexities. The use of small
   signal model of the converter in conjunction with artificial
   intelligence in a robust controller structure guarantees excellent
   dynamic response. This work implements the fuzzy controller for
   converter circuit to improve the dynamic performance of asymmetric
   half-bridge DC-DC converter. It establishes fuzzy controller to overcome
   the limitations of the conventional PI controller. The conventional
   controller has lower loop band width and high distortion coefficient. So
   the system response is sluggish. In this work fuzzy logic is used to
   improve the characteristics of the DC-DC converter system by controlling
   its duty cycle. The fuzzy controller output is compared with a PI
   controller for five different operating conditions. The results show
   that the fuzzy controller is able to achieve faster transient response,
   less peak overshoot, better rejection of disturbances and is less
   dependent on the operating point of the converter. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) is a recently proposed optimization
   technique which has shown to be competitive to other population-based
   stochastic algorithms. However, ABC is good at exploration but poor at
   exploitation because of its solution search strategy. Thus, to obtain an
   efficient performance, utilizing different characteristics of solution
   search strategies can be appropriate during different stages of the
   search process to achieve a tradeoff between exploration and
   exploitation. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-strategy ensemble
   ABC (MEABC) algorithm. In MEABC, a pool of distinct solution search
   strategies coexists throughout the search process and competes to
   produce offspring. Experiments are conducted on a set of commonly used
   numerical benchmark functions, including the CEC 2013 shifted and
   rotated problems. Results show that MEABC performs significantly better
   than, or at least comparable to, some well-established evolutionary
   algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The implicit Colebrook-White equation has been widely used to estimate
   the friction factor for turbulent fluid in irrigation pipes. A fast,

   study, the performance of some artificial intelligence approaches,
   including gene expression programming (GEP), which is a variant of
   genetic programming (GP); adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS);
   and artificial neural network (ANN) has been compared to the M5 model
   tree, which is a data mining technique and, to most available
   approximations, is based on root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
   absolute error (MAE) and correlation coefficient (R). Results show that
   Serghides and Buzzelli approximations with RMSE (0.00002), MAE
   (0.00001), and R (0.99999) values had the best performances. Among the
   data mining and artificial intelligence approaches, the GEP with RMSE
   (0.00032), MAE (0.00026), and R (0.99953) values performed better.
   However, all 20 explicit approximations except Wood, Churchill (full

   estimated the friction factor more accurately than the GEP.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting stock composite index is useful, which can raise the interest
   of both the investors and the corresponding researchers. This paper
   presented a new combination prediction model based on the technique of
   artificial intelligence and the principle of combination forecast. The
   principle of combination forecast, as a valid foundation of the new
   model, was strictly proved and carefully illustrated in this paper.
   Given the predicting rules, the new combination model was established by
   synthesizing three commonly used prediction models based on the
   principle of combination forecast. The comprehensive usage of
   qualitative forecast and quantitative forecast is also a feature of the
   new model. To valid the new model, comparison analysis and multi-agent
   simulation were both applied. Besides, the application of multi-agent
   simulation made the new model able to guide the investors' operations in
   a real stock market. According to the theoretical proof, the comparison
   analysis and the simulation experiment, the new combination prediction
   model tends to be a powerful and applicable tool in making the

Title = {{Feed forward artificial neural network to predict contact force at
   medial knee joint: Application to gait modification}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{114-129}},

Abstract = {{Knee contact force (KCF) is one of the most meaningful parameters to
   evaluate function of the knee joint. However in vivo measurement of KCF
   is not always straight forward. Inverse dynamics analysis, as one of the
   most frequently used computational techniques to calculate KCF, has its
   own limitations. The purpose of this study was to develop a feed forward
   artificial neural network (FFANN) to predict the medial condyle KCF
   corresponding to two different gait modifications known as medial thrust
   and trunk sway. Four patients implanted with unilateral knee
   sensor-based prostheses were obtained from the literature. The network
   was trained based on pre-rehabilitation gait patterns and was recruited
   to predict the medial KCF associated with rehabilitation patterns.
   Generalization ability of the proposed network was tested within three
   different levels including intra subject (level 1), inter condition
   (level 2) and inter subject (level 3). FFANN predictions were validated
   against in vivo measurements.
   Results showed subject-specific neural network could predict KCF to a
   certain high level of accuracy (medial thrust: (NRMSE) over bar =
   10.6\%, (p) over bar = 0.96; trunk sway: (NRMSE) over bar = 9.6\%, (p)
   over bar = 0.96) based on the ground reaction forces (GRFs) and some
   independent marker trajectories (level 1) which suggested that not all
   of the markers are necessary for knee force calculation. Moreover at
   level 2, a generic FFANN could predict the medial knee force based on
   electromyography (EMG) signals and GRFs (medial thrust:(NRMSE) over bar
   = 11.2\%, (p) over bar = 0.96; trunk sway:(NRMSE) over bar = 10.5\%, (p)
   over bar = 0.95) which released the necessity of motion capture and
   subject specific scaling of a musculoskeletal model. At level 3, neural
   network could predict the general pattern and features of KCF for a new
   subject that was not used in the network training (medial thrust:
   (NRMSE) over bar = 12.6\%, (p) over bar = 0.95; trunk sway: (NRMSE) over
   bar = 13.3\%, (p) over bar = 0.94).
   In conclusion, FFANN could predict the medial knee joint loading
   corresponding to two different knee rehabilitations based on
   pre-rehabilitation gait patterns. Compared to the inverse dynamics
   method, artificial intelligence represents a much easier and faster
   method; together they can be combined to calculate joint loading
   involving fewer markers and speed up the calculations. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Managing quality of service (QoS) is an important network operation,
   especially in hybrid wired and wireless multimedia networks. In this
   study, a two-stage approach to intelligently manage QoS for multimedia
   traffic was developed. Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) was included
   in the study as an example of a typical multimedia application.
   Initially an adaptive statistical sampling technique was employed. It
   determined the traffic's statistics and used them in a fuzzy inference
   system to determine the optimum interval between every two consecutive
   sections of the traffic sampled. In the second stage, a fuzzy c-means
   (FCM) clustering was used to pre-process QoS parameters (delay, jitter
   and packet loss ratio) obtained from the devised sampling scheme. A
   multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network then used the information
   from FCM to assess the QoS provided for VoIP.
   It was shown that the developed adaptive statistical sampling represents
   the traffic more correctly than the systematic, stratified and random
   non-adaptive sampling methods. Also, the combination of statistical
   sampling followed by FCM and MLP accurately indicated the QoS for VoIP.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) has been widely used for the detection of
   incipient faults in oil-filled transformers. This research presents a
   novel approach to DGA feature prioritisation and classification, which
   considers not only the relations between a fault type and specific gas
   ratios but also their statistical characteristics based on data derived
   from onsite inspections. Firstly, new gas features are acquired based on
   the analysis of current international gas interpretation standards.
   Combined with conventional gas ratios, all features are then prioritised
   by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The rankings are obtained by using
   their values of maximum statistic distance. The first three features in
   ranking are employed as input vectors to a multilayer support vector
   machine, whose tuning parameters are acquired by particle swarm
   optimisation. In the experiment, a bootstrap technique is implemented to
   approximately equalise sample numbers of different fault cases. A common
   10-fold cross-validation technique is employed for performance
   assessment. Typical artificial intelligence classifiers with gas
   features extracted from genetic programming are evaluated for comparison
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Stricter requirements on the quality of industrial plant operation
   together with environmental limits and decreasing energy consumption
   bring more complex automation systems. The intelligent control
   techniques, which are based on approaches from diverse disciplines
   including statistics, artificial intelligence or signal processing, have
   been widely used during the last years and their benefits have been
   proved. They cannot be developed and tested without simulation models
   and access to online and historical data. This article proposes a
   platform for the integration of simulations and industrial SCADA systems
   supporting complex data access and simulation code re-use.
   The idea of the presented framework is to connect simulations, data
   sources, optimizers, other calculations and SCADA systems into one
   integrated environment. seamlessly. A technical level of the framework
   provides integration of stakeholders and a semantic level captures
   engineering knowledge in inter-mapped ontologies and configures the
   technical level, which is often called model-driven configuration. The
   semantic level utilizes a formal model implemented as set of ontologies.
   The major contribution of the article are the layered model of the
   integration architecture and formulation of the integration requirements
   in the industrial automation domain. The proposed solution has been
   implemented and tested on a software prototype level. It is demonstrated
   on two use-cases covering both design and integration of simulation
   models from the industrial perspective. The pro, posed architecture is
   intended to be as general,as possible, however it has been tested on
   signal-oriented simulators only. It is the main limitation Of this
   contribution and it should be addressed in upcoming work. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is a swarm intelligence algorithm for
   optimization that has previously been applied to the training of neural

   comparison with the traditional Back-Propagation (BP) training
   algorithm. The empirical results for benchmark problems demonstrate that
   using the standard ``stopping early{''} approach with optimized learning
   parameters leads to improved BP performance over the previous
   comparative study, and that a simple variation of the ABC approach
   provides improved ABC performance too. With both improvements applied,
   the ABC approach does perform very well on small problems, but the
   generalization performances achieved are only significantly better than
   standard BP on one out of six datasets, and the training times increase
   rapidly as the size of the problem grows. If different, evolutionary
   optimized, BP learning rates are allowed for the two layers of the
   neural network, BP is significantly better than the ABC on two of the
   six datasets, and not significantly different on the other four.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the use of qualitative reasoning to predict the behaviour of
   a dynamical system given a change in one of its parameters based upon a
   qualitative representation of its bifurcation diagram. We present three
   algorithms to perform this task. The first algorithm generates a
   qualitative representation from a quantitative representation of the
   bifurcation diagram of the system. The second uses the qualitative
   representation to simulate the behaviour of the system given a sequence
   of parameter adjustments or perturbations. The third algorithm solves
   the opposite, control problem: it determines what parameters to change
   to take the system from an initial to a given goal state. The first
   algorithm segments a quantitative bifurcation diagram into MSs having
   the same qualitative behaviour. These MSs are then interconnected into a
   relational network. The network is used by the other two algorithms to
   simulate and plan the behaviour of the system from an initial situation.
   We present examples illustrating the qualitative representations and the
   behaviours of the simulation and planning algorithms for dynamical
   systems of one parameter.}},

Title = {{Optimization of anemia treatment in hemodialysis patients via

Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Anemia is a frequent comorbidity in hemodialysis patients
   that can be successfully treated by administering
   erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). ESAs dosing is currently based
   on clinical protocols that often do not account for the high inter- and
   intra-individual variability in the patient's response. As a result, the
   hemoglobin level of some patients oscillates around the target range,
   which is associated with multiple risks and side-effects. This work
   proposes a methodology based on reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize
   ESA therapy.
   Methods: RL is a data-driven approach for solving sequential
   decision-making problems that are formulated as Markov decision
   processes (MDPs). Computing optimal drug administration strategies for
   chronic diseases is a sequential decision-making problem in which the
   goalds to find the best sequence of drug doses. MDPs are particularly
   suitable for modeling these problems due to their ability to capture the
   uncertainty associated with the outcome of the treatment and the
   stochastic nature of the underlying process. The RL algorithm employed
   in the proposed methodology is fitted Q iteration, which stands out for
   its ability to make an efficient use of data.
   Results: The experiments reported here are based on a computational
   model that describes the effect of ESAs on the hemoglobin level. The
   performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with the
   well-known Q-learning algorithm and with a standard protocol. Simulation
   results show that the performance of Q-learning is substantially lower
   than FQI and the protocol. When comparing FQI and the protocol, FQI
   achieves an increment of 27.6\% in the proportion of patients that are
   within the targeted range of hemoglobin during the period of treatment.
   In addition, the quantity of drug needed is reduced by 5.13\%, which
   indicates a more efficient use of ESAs.
   Conclusion: Although prospective validation is required, promising
   results demonstrate the potential of RL to become an alternative to
   current protocols. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Different from the ``black-box{''} evaluation, the diagnostic evaluation
   aims to provide a better explanatory power into various aspects of the
   performance of artificial intelligence systems. However, for machine
   translation (MT) systems, due to its complexity and knowledge
   dependency, such diagnostic evaluation often demands a large amount of
   manual work. To tackle this problem, we propose an automatic diagnostic
   evaluation methodology, called Woodpecker, which enables multi-factored
   evaluation of MT systems based on linguistic categories and
   automatically constructed linguistic checkpoints. The taxonomy of the
   categories is defined with rich linguistic knowledge, including
   phenomena on different linguistic levels. The instances of the
   categories are composed into test cases called linguistic checkpoints.
   We present a method that automatically extracts checkpoints from
   parallel sentences, through which, Woodpecker can automatically monitor
   a MT system in translating various linguistic phenomena, thereby
   facilitating diagnostic evaluation. The effectiveness of Woodpecker is
   verified through in-house experiments and open MT evaluation tracks on
   various types of MT systems.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{351-375}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{It has been recognized that human behavior is an observable consequence
   of the interactions between cognitive and affective functions. This
   perception has motivated the study of human emotions in disciplines such
   as psychology and neuroscience and led to the formulation of a number of
   theories and models that attempt to explain the mechanisms underlying
   this human process. In the field of artificial intelligence, these
   theoretical findings have posed a series of challenges in the
   development of autonomous agents (AAs) capable of exhibiting very
   believable and human-like behaviors. One of these challenges is the
   design and implementation of computational models of emotions (CMEs),
   which are software systems designed to provide AAs with proper
   mechanisms for the processing of emotional information, elicitation of
   synthetic emotions, and generation of emotional behaviors. In this
   paper, we review this type of computational model from the perspective
   of their development. Particularly, we investigate five design aspects
   that influence their development process: theoretical foundations,
   operating cycle, interaction between cognition and emotion,
   architectural design, and role in cognitive agent architectures. We
   provide discussions about key issues and challenges in the development
   of CMEs and suggest research that may lead to more robust and flexible
   designs for this type of computational model.}},

Abstract = {{One of the key points to maintain and boost research and development in
   the area of smart wearable systems (SWS) is the development of
   integrated architectures for intelligent services, as well as wearable
   systems and devices for health and wellness management. This paper
   presents such a generic architecture for multiparametric, intelligent
   and ubiquitous wireless sensing platforms. It is a transparent,
   smartphone-based sensing framework with customizable wireless interfaces
   and plug'n'play capability to easily interconnect third party sensor
   devices. It caters to wireless body, personal, and near-me area
   networks. A pivotal part of the platform is the integrated inference
   engine/runtime environment that allows the mobile device to serve as a
   user-adaptable personal health assistant. The novelty of this system
   lays in a rapid visual development and remote deployment model. The
   complementary visual Inference Engine Editor that comes with the package
   enables artificial intelligence specialists, alongside with medical
   experts, to build data processing models by assembling different
   components and instantly deploying them (remotely) on patient mobile
   devices. In this paper, the new logic-centered software architecture for
   ubiquitous health monitoring applications is described, followed by a
   discussion as to how it helps to shift focus from software and hardware
   development, to medical and health process-centered design of new SWS
   applications.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a human activity automatization phenomenon is analyzed as
   a process as a result of which a cognitive structure is replaced by the
   equivalent reflexive structure. Such replacement plays an essential role
   as a mechanism that optimizes human mental processes according to their
   energetic and time consuming aspects. The main goal of the studies
   described in this paper is working out the algorithm that enables us to
   create the analogous mechanism in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.
   The solution would enable us to use in real time systems such AI
   systems, that, so far, could not have been used due to their high time
   consumption. The information metabolism theory (IMT) is the basis for
   the analysis. A cybernetic model of automatization, based on IMT, is
   introduced. There have been specified conditions according to which such
   solution is profitable. An automatization-type mechanism has been
   applied to IP traffic scanner and to a mutiagent system. As a result,
   time and memory properties of the systems have been improved
   significantly.}},

   patterns in each task and used them to select the best candidate object.
   When using all the information gathered from all sensory modalities and
   behaviors, and when using the best method for measuring the perceptual
   distances between objects, the robot was able to achieve 99.44\%
   accuracy over the posed tasks. This shows that the general framework
   described in this paper is useful for solving matrix completion tasks.}},

Abstract = {{University course timetabling is concerned with assigning a set of
   courses to a set of rooms and timeslots according to a set of
   constraints. This problem has been tackled using metaheuristics
   techniques. Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has been successfully
   used for tackling uncapaciated examination and course timetabling
   problems. In this paper, a novel hybrid ABC algorithm based on the
   integrated technique is proposed for tackling the university course
   timetabling problem. First of all, initial feasible solutions are
   generated using the combination of saturation degree (SD) and
   backtracking algorithm (BA). Secondly, a hill climbing optimizer is
   embedded within the employed bee operator to enhance the local
   exploitation ability of the original ABC algorithm while tackling the
   problem. Hill climbing iteratively navigates the search space of each
   population member in order to reach a local optima. The proposed hybrid
   ABC technique is evaluated using the dataset established by Socha
   including five small, five medium and one large problem instances.
   Empirical results on these problem instances validate the effectiveness
   and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Our work also shows that a
   well-designed hybrid technique is a competitive alternative for
   addressing the university course timetabling problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A full realization of alternative energy such as biofuels depends on the
   existence of a viable supply chain (SC) network. An agent-based
   simulation approach is pursued to understand the dynamics of the
   biofuels SC network. The interests of three SC actors are represented:
   users, biorefineries, and farmers. Each actor type has a binary decision
   option: adoption or non-adoption of biofuels. This SC network model is
   characterized by distributed control, time asynchrony, and resource
   contention among actors, who make decisions based on incomplete
   knowledge and delayed information. The decision dynamics of these actors
   are modeled using a computational ecosystem construct. A preliminary set
   of coupled payoff function for each actor type and each decision is
   developed to represent interdependencies among SC actors. The simulation
   model was used to evaluate three archetypes of subsidy policy. The SC
   network behavior is observed in terms of fraction of actors adopting the
   biofuel option. The SC network shows behaviors ranging from fixed point
   equilibrium under no delay and perfect knowledge to periodic and chaotic
   oscillations. The network behavior is very sensitive to the time delay
   parameter that partly influences the quality of information on which
   actors' decisions are based. Several regions of SC behavior are
   identified. In particular, a chaotic behavior was observed. The work
   provides a methodological basis for further development, including
   identification of policies to control undesirable system behaviors.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{453-463}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Fuzzy time series approaches are used when observations of time series
   contain uncertainty. Moreover, these approaches do not require the
   assumptions needed for traditional time series approaches. Generally,
   fuzzy time series methods consist of three stages, namely,
   fuzzification, determination of fuzzy relations, and defuzzification.
   Artificial intelligence algorithms are frequently used in these stages
   with genetic algorithms being the most popular of these algorithms owing
   to their rich operators and good performance. However, the mutation
   operator of a GA may cause some negative results in the solution set.
   Thus, we propose a modified genetic algorithm to find optimal interval
   lengths and control the effects of the mutation operator. The results of
   applying our new approach to real datasets show superior forecasting
   performance when compared with those obtained by other techniques.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents LS-VisionDraughts: an efficient unsupervised
   evolutionary learning system for Checkers whose contribution is to
   automate the process of selecting an appropriate representation for the
   board states - by means of Evolutionary Computation - keeping a deep
   look-ahead (search depth) at the moment of choosing an adequate move. It
   corresponds to a player Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network whose
   weights are updated through an evaluation function that is automatically
   adjusted by means of the Temporal Difference methods. A Genetic
   Algorithm automatically chooses a concise and efficient set of
   functions, which describe various scenarios associated with Checkers -
   called features - to represent the board states in the input layer of
   the Neural Network. It means that each individual of the Genetic
   Algorithm is a candidate set of features that is associated to a
   distinct Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network. The output layer of the
   Neural Network is a real number (prediction) that indicates to which
   extent the input state is favorable to provide a better agent
   performance. In LS-VisionDraughts, a particular version of the search
   algorithm Alpha-Beta, called fail-soft Alpha-Beta, combined with Table
   Transposition, Iterative Deepening and ordered tree, uses this
   prediction value to choose the best move corresponding to the current
   board state. The best individual is chosen by means of numerous
   tournaments involving these selfsame Neural Networks. The architecture
   of LS-VisionDraught is inspired on the agent NeuroDraughts. However, the
   former system enhances the performance of the latter by automating the
   selection of the features through Evolutionary Computation and by
   replacing its Minimax search algorithm with the improved search strategy
   resumed above. This procedure allows for a 95 \% reduction in the search
   runtime. Further, it remarkably increases the search tree depth. The
   results obtained from evaluative tournaments confirm the advances of
   LS-VisionDraughts compared to its opponents. It is however important to
   point out that LS-VisionDraughts learns practically without human
   supervision, contrary to the current automatic world champion Chinook,
   which has been built in a strongly supervised manner.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In recent decades, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been
   pronounced as a branch of computer science to model wide range of
   hydrological phenomena. A number of researches have been still comparing
   these techniques in order to find more effective approaches in terms of
   accuracy and applicability. In this study, we examined the ability of
   linear genetic programming (LGP) technique to model successive-station
   monthly streamflow process, as an applied alternative for streamflow
   prediction. A comparative efficiency study between LGP and three
   different artificial neural network algorithms, namely feed forward back
   propagation (FFBP), generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), and
   radial basis function (RBF), has also been presented in this study. For
   this aim, firstly, we put forward six different successive-station
   monthly streamflow prediction scenarios subjected to training by LGP and
   FFBP using the field data recorded at two gauging stations on Coruh
   River, Turkey. Based on Nash-Sutcliffe and root mean squared error
   measures, we then compared the efficiency of these techniques and
   selected the best prediction scenario. Eventually, GRNN and RBF
   algorithms were utilized to restructure the selected scenario and to
   compare with corresponding FFBP and LGP. Our results indicated the
   promising role of LGP for successive-station monthly streamflow
   prediction providing more accurate results than those of all the ANN
   algorithms. We found an explicit LGP-based expression evolved by only
   the basic arithmetic functions as the best prediction model for the
   river, which uses the records of the both target and upstream stations.

Abstract = {{This work integrates artificial bee colony (ABC) and bees algorithm (BA)
   to develop a two bees (TB) algorithm. Agents of TB are stochastically
   assigned to ABC and BA sub-swarms in each iteration according to their
   fitness values. Consequently, the current healthier sub-swarm gains more
   agents to carry out its actions. Sub-swarm populations therefore vary
   ceaselessly during iterations, while either the ABC or BA sub-swarms may
   be superior to the other. Experiments are conducted on 23 benchmark
   functions. Results demonstrate that the TB performs better than or close
   to the ABC or BA winner. TB overcomes the poor performance of ABC and BA
   in handling particular problems.}},

Abstract = {{This publication discusses new development directions of cognitive
   economics charted based on cognitive processes of financial data
   analysis. Semantic analysis tasks will be dedicated to cognitive
   economics systems. Such systems, which semantically analyse the economic
   situation of enterprises/organisations/business structures, execute
   their tasks using semantic information available to them (contained in
   data sets). The foundation for the operation of economic cognitive
   systems consists in both the semantic analysis of the situation of an
   enterprise described by various economic/financial ratios and the
   assessment of the future situation of this enterprise. Hence cognitive
   economics is geared towards the semantic analysis of the
   economic/financial situation of enterprises carried out by means of an
   in-depth description, an analysis, a reasoning and a projection of the
   future condition of enterprises. The subject of cognitive economics
   discussed for the purpose of indicating and elaborating on the
   directions of this discipline and of semantic analysis of
   economic/financial data goes hand in hand with the currently growing
   trend of soft computing. Methods of semantic analysis, just like e.g.
   neural networks, were developed by researchers inspired by the operation
   of the human mind. The cognitive, decision-making, reasoning,
   understanding and prediction processes running in this mind have become
   the basis for attempts to create information systems analysing various
   data. This type of analysis, based on extracting semantic aspects and
   information from the analysed data sets has been aimed at using
   computational methods to help solve various problems. Since such
   solutions are dedicated to bioinformatics, cognitive informatics and
   artificial intelligence, it appeared likely that they could also be used
   in economics. It is in this regard that the development of semantic data
   analysis methods (dedicated to economic/financial problems) puts
   cognitive economics in the same group with all other scientific
   disciplines making use of soft computing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The past few decades have witnessed an increasing growth in mobile and
   wireless network, leading to a corresponding fast growth in mobile
   demands. However, the proliferating mobile demands compel wireless
   network to face several challenges, such as the conflict between
   spectrum crisis and low resource utilization ratio, and the poor quality
   of service and quality of experience. Wireless virtualization, enabling
   multiple concurrent virtual networks running on shared wireless
   substrate resource, has been proposed as a promising way to overcome the
   plights of the current mobile and wireless network. How to efficiently
   allocate the resource, especially the spectrum resource, of physical
   network to multiple virtual networks is one fundamental and important
   challenge in wireless virtualization. This paper rethinks the
   characteristics of virtual networks' requirements, and then divides the
   requirement into a baseline part and a fluctuant part. Based on it, this
   paper introduces an opportunistic spectrum sharing approach, through
   which we formulate the spectrum resource allocation problem as an
   NP-Hard problem. Then, we propose our opportunistic spectrum resource
   allocation scheme for the wireless virtualization. Simulations validate
   the performance advantages of our approach and show that opportunistic
   spectrum sharing significantly improves the revenue, resource
   utilization and acceptance ratio of physical wireless network while
   decreasing the payments of virtual networks.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Recently, researchers have tried to better understand human behaviors so
   as to let robots act in more human ways, which means a robot may have
   its own emotions defined by its designers. To achieve this goal, in this
   study, we designed and simulated a robot, named Shiau\_Lu, which is
   empowered with six universal human emotions, including happiness, anger,
   fear, sadness, disgust and surprise. When we input a sentence to
   Shiau\_Lu through voice, it recognizes the sentence by invoking the
   Google speech recognition method running on an Android system, and
   outputs a sentence to reveal its current emotional states. Each input
   sentence affects the strength of the six emotional variables used to
   represent the six emotions, one corresponding to one. After that, the
   emotional variables will change into new states. The consequent fuzzy
   inference process infers and determines the most significant emotion as
   the primary emotion, with which an appropriate output sentence as a
   response of the input is chosen from its Output-sentence database. With
   the new states of the six emotional variables, when the robot encounters
   another sentence, the above process repeats and another output sentence
   is then selected and replied. Artificial intelligence and psychological
   theories of human behaviors have been applied to the robot to simulate
   how emotions are influenced by the outside world through languages. In
   fact, the robot may help autistic children to interact more with the
   world around them and relate themselves well to the outside world.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{85-98}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the application of artificial intelligence tools for
   the path planning of complex multi-agent robotic systems. In particular,
   a solution is proposed to the planning problem for the conjoint
   operation of two or more mobile robotic fixtures used for the
   manufacturing of large workpieces, like those used in the aerospace
   industry. Such fixturing systems have been recently designed and tested,
   raising hopes to better satisfy the dynamic conditions of modern
   manufacturing, with its increasing emphasis on flexibility,
   adaptability, and automation. The proposed planning method is novel in
   two fundamental aspects. First, it interprets planning as a constraint
   satisfaction problem (CSP), rather than as a constrained optimisation,
   an approach ubiquitous in the path and motion planning literature.
   Secondly, the formulated CSP is solved by a hierarchy of incremental
   state space search algorithms which differ in some way from the existing
   state of the art. This hierarchy includes levels related to the robot
   and workpiece arrangement parameters and to three components of mobile
   fixture agents: a supporting head, a mobile base, and a parallel
   manipulator, respectively. Due to the use of CSP search, the planner
   constitutes a largely application-independent framework, on the basis of
   which specific industrial implementations can be defined by supplying
   the relevant physical, geometrical, and time-related constraints. (C)

Abstract = {{Logic, language and information integration is one of areas broadly
   explored nowadays and at the same time promising. Authors use that
   approach in their 8 years long research into Structured Semantic
   Knowledge Base System. The aim of this paper is to present authors idea
   of system capable of generating synergy effect while storing various
   type of information. The key assumption, which has been adopted, is the
   thesis that the attempt to find universal way of the reality description
   is very inefficient solution. Combination of several solutions into one
   system must be based on the principle of supporting rather than on
   redundancy, ambiguity or mutual antagonism areas of logic, language and
   information. Natural language processing in the context of logics or
   information processing is ineffective, not to say pointless in the means
   of certainty. It is simply caused by the fact that natural languages
   have been formed long time ago as the main communication channel, rather
   than for automatic information processing. It was one of the reasons
   that logic has been founded as the universal language of mathematics and
   formalized communication in more extensive sense. Information processing
   however brought more sophisticated problems that mathematics could not
   smoothly solve, what made computer science appear. Studies over
   artificial intelligence revealed even more complex issues to solve. The
   unity of those three areas: logics, language and information is a
   necessity to acquire complementarity and synergy.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of the Internet and digital technology,
   digital music and Internet radio stations have come to attract
   increasing investment from various sources. Through the Internet, users
   are able to listen to music and radio stations without geographical
   limitations. The Internet also provides users more options in their
   music and radio station choices. The technological developments in this
   field allow for improvements in car audio systems. However, across all
   relevant studies, the question of how best to recommend radio or music
   choices to users remains an important topic in the research relating to
   digital music and radio. Therefore, in this paper, we try to improve
   these recommendations by recording user behavior and analyzing the music
   preferences of users with similar background information. This is
   different to traditional recommendation mechanisms as we simplify the
   feedback procedure for users. In addition, by adjusting the weightings
   in the formula for calculating the recommendations, we are able to
   provide personalized recommendations. This would better satisfy the
   needs of different types of users. Through experimental results, we
   prove that our recommendation mechanism significantly helps users to
   select radio stations and music.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes using evolutionary multivariate adaptive regression
   splines (EMARS), an artificial intelligence (AI) model, to efficiently
   predict the energy performance of buildings (EPB). EMARS is a hybrid of
   multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and artificial bee
   colony (ABC). In EMARS, MARS addresses learning and curve fitting and
   ABC carries out optimization to determine the fittest parameter settings
   with minimal prediction error. The proposed model was constructed using
   768 experimental datasets from the literature, with eight input
   parameters and two output parameters (cooling load (CL) and heating load
   (HL)). EMARS performance was compared against five other AI models,
   including MARS, back-propagation neural network (BPNN), radial basis
   function neural network (RBFNN), classification and regression tree
   (CART), and support vector machine (SVM). A 10-fold cross-validation
   approach found EMARS to be the best model for predicting CL and HL with
   65\% and 45\% deduction in terms of RMSE, respectively, compared to
   other methods. Furthermore, EMARS is able to operate autonomously
   without human intervention or domain knowledge; represent derived
   relationship between response (HL and a) with predictor variables
   associated with their relative importance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{836-866}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In complex open multi-agent systems (MAS), where there is no centralised
   control and individuals have equal authority, ensuring cooperative and
   coordinated behaviour is challenging. Norms and conventions are useful
   means of supporting cooperation in an emergent decentralised manner,
   however it takes time for effective norms and conventions to emerge.
   Identifying influential individuals enables the targeted seeding of
   desirable norms and conventions, which can reduce the establishment time
   and increase efficacy. Existing research is limited with respect to
   considering (i) how to identify influential agents, (ii) the extent to
   which network location imbues influence on an agent, and (iii) the
   extent to which different network structures affect influence. In this
   paper, we propose a methodology for learning a model for predicting the
   network value of an agent, in terms of the extent to which it can
   influence the rest of the population. Applying our methodology, we show
   that exploiting knowledge of the network structure can significantly
   increase the ability of individuals to influence which convention
   emerges. We evaluate our methodology in the context of two
   agent-interaction models, namely, the language coordination domain used
   by Salazar et al. (AI Communications 23(4): 357-372, 2010) and a
   coordination game of the form used by Sen and Airiau (in: Proceedings of
   the 20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,
   2007) with heterogeneous agent learning mechanisms, and on a variety of
   synthetic and real-world networks. We further show that (i) the models
   resulting from our methodology are effective in predicting influential
   network locations, (ii) there are very few locations that can be
   classified as influential in typical networks, (iii) four single metrics
   are robustly indicative of influence across a range of network
   structures, and (iv) our methodology learns which single metric or
   combined measure is the best predictor of influence in a given network.}},

Abstract = {{Computer viruses have become a serious threat to the information system.
   Due to the complexity and behavioral uncertainty of virus codes, as well
   as the emergence of encryption and metamorphic viruses which lead to the
   ineffectiveness of traditional detection methods, applying artificial
   intelligence based approach to virus detection has become the focal
   issue of the current antivirus research. In this paper, we propose a
   novel approach that introduces ensemble learning into automatic virus
   detection technique, which is based on the integration of dynamic virus
   detection and static detection. The detection system utilizes support
   vector machine (SVM) as member classifier to construct the dynamic
   behavior model of viruses, and also uses probabilistic neural network
   (NN) as member classifier for static behavior modeling. Finally, the
   detection results from all member classifiers are integrated by D-S
   theory of evidence. The experiments show that the diversity of combining
   heterogeneous classifiers leads to the great performance improvement of
   the ensemble method of virus detector. The experimental results show
   that the proposed approach is very efficient in detecting unknown and
   metamorphic viruses, and further comparison indicates that its
   performance is superior to most of the popular commercial antivirus
   tools. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The hierarchy of formal languages is a mathematical representation of
   linguistic geometry (LG). LG is a type of game theory for a class of
   extensive discrete games called abstract board games (ABG), scalable to
   the level of real life defense systems. LG is a formal model of human
   reasoning about armed conflict, a mental reality ``hardwired'' in the
   human brain. LG, an evolutionary product of millions of years of human
   warfare, must be a component of the primary language of the human brain
   (as introduced by Von Neumann). Experiences of development of LG must be
   instructive for solving another major puzzle, discovering the algorithm
   of discovery, yet another ancient component of the primary language.
   This paper reports results on discovering mental processes involved in
   the development of the hierarchy of formal languages. Those mental
   processes manifesting execution of the algorithm of discovery are called
   visual streams. This paper reveals the visual streams that were involved
   in the thought experiments led to the development of the formal theory
   of LG. Specifically, it demonstrates the streams involved in choosing
   the formal-linguistic representation of LG; the type of formal languages
   and grammars, the so-called controlled grammars; the construction of the
   grammars of shortest trajectories and the grammar of zones. This paper
   introduces a hypothesis of how we construct and focus visual streams.}},

Abstract = {{A gap still exists between complex discrete-event systems (DESs) and the
   effectiveness of the state-of-the-art diagnosis techniques, where faults
   are defined at component levels and diagnoses incorporate the
   occurrences of component faults. All these approaches to diagnosis are
   context-free, in as much diagnosis is anchored to components,
   irrespective of the context in which they are embedded. By contrast,
   since complex DESs are naturally organized in hierarchies of contexts,
   different diagnosis rules are to be defined for different contexts.
   Diagnosis rules are specified based on associations between
   context-sensitive faults and regular expressions, called semantic
   patterns. Since the alphabets of such regular expressions are
   stratified, so that the semantic patterns of a context are defined based
   on the interface symbols of its subcontexts only, separation of concerns
   is achieved, and the expressive power of diagnosis is enhanced. This new
   approach to diagnosis is bound to seemingly contradictory but
   nonetheless possible scenarios: a DES can be normal despite the faulty
   behavior of a number of its components; also, it can be faulty despite
   the normal behavior of all its components.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of online multitask learning for solving multiple
   related classification tasks in parallel, aiming at classifying every
   sequence of data received by each task accurately and efficiently. One
   practical example of online multitask learning is the micro-blog
   sentiment detection on a group of users, which classifies micro-blog
   posts generated by each user into emotional or non-emotional categories.
   This particular online learning task is challenging for a number of
   reasons. First of all, to meet the critical requirements of online
   applications, a highly efficient and scalable classification solution
   that can make immediate predictions with low learning cost is needed.
   This requirement leaves conventional batch learning algorithms out of
   consideration. Second, classical classification methods, be it batch or
   online, often encounter a dilemma when applied to a group of tasks,
   i.e., on one hand, a single classification model trained on the entire
   collection of data from all tasks may fail to capture characteristics of
   individual task; on the other hand, a model trained independently on
   individual tasks may suffer from insufficient training data. To overcome
   these challenges, in this paper, we propose a collaborative online
   multitask learning method, which learns a global model over the entire
   data of all tasks. At the same time, individual models for multiple
   related tasks are jointly inferred by leveraging the global model
   through a collaborative online learning approach. We illustrate the
   efficacy of the proposed technique on a synthetic dataset. We also
   evaluate it on three real-life problems-spam email filtering,
   bioinformatics data classification, and micro-blog sentiment detection.
   Experimental results show that our method is effective and scalable at
   the online classification of multiple related tasks.}},

   PD + I, self-tuning fuzzy logic PID (STF-PID) controller and fuzzy
   logic-based sliding mode adaptive controller (FLSMAC) are designed for
   stable autopilot system and are compared with conventional PI
   controller. The target of throttle, speed and altitude controls are to
   achieve a wide range of air speed, improved energy efficiency and fuel
   economy with reduced pollutant emission. The energy efficiency using
   specific energy rate per velocity of UAV is also presented in this

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Distance-based and generalization-based methods are two families of
   artificial intelligence techniques that have been successfully used over
   a wide range of real-world problems. In the first case, general
   algorithms can be applied to any data representation by just changing
   the distance. The metric space sets the search and learning space, which
   is generally instance-oriented. In the second case, models can be
   obtained for a given pattern language, which can be comprehensible. The
   generality-ordered space sets the search and learning space, which is
   generally model-oriented. However, the concepts of distance and
   generalization clash in many different ways, especially when knowledge
   representation is complex (e. g., structured data). This work
   establishes a framework where these two fields can be integrated in a
   consistent way. We introduce the concept of distance-based
   generalization, which connects all the generalized examples in such a
   way that all of them are reachable inside the generalization by using
   straight paths in the metric space. This makes the metric space and the
   generality-ordered space coherent (or even dual). Additionally, we also
   introduce a definition of minimal distance-based generalization that can
   be seen as the first formulation of the Minimum Description Length
   (MDL)/Minimum Message Length (MML) principle in terms of a distance
   function. We instantiate and develop the framework for the most common
   data representations and distances, where we show that consistent
   instances can be found for numerical data, nominal data, sets, lists,
   tuples, graphs, first-order atoms, and clauses. As a result, general
   learning methods that integrate the best from distance-based and
   generalization-based methods can be defined and adapted to any specific
   problem by appropriately choosing the distance, the pattern language and
   the generalization operator.}},

Abstract = {{Since the industrial revolution, technological evolution has been the
   defining aspect of societal progress. Among all the technologies that
   have emerged over the years, information technology is the one that
   truly revolutionized the modern lifestyle. To take information
   technology beyond information mining and communication, intelligence
   technology (InT) is required to manipulate the information and knowledge
   with human-like intelligence. However, transforming InT into the next
   technological wave requires a medium to actualize InT with all its
   potential. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an intelligence super
   agent (iSA) as an autonomous entity equipped with all categories of
   intelligence, i.e. cognitive, social, behavioral, ambient, collective,
   and genetic intelligences. To realize the iSA, we also present a modular
   architecture, named intelligence operating architecture (iOA), capable
   of implementing all aspects of InT along with a biologically-inspired
   thought process. As a novel implementation platform for the iSA, we
   present user-centered development of robots enacted through agent based
   modularization (UDREAM). The effectiveness of UDREAM is shown through
   some application-specific experiments with individual robots. Although
   the current iSA is for a limited number of services with a standalone
   robot, it can be extended to a more complex iSA.}},

Abstract = {{In today's world of excessive development in technologies,
   sustainability and adaptability of computer applications is a challenge,
   and future prediction became significant. Therefore, strong artificial
   intelligence (AI) became important and, thus, statistical machine
   learning (ML) methods were applied to serve it. These methods are very
   difficult to understand, and they predict the future without showing
   how. However, understanding of how machines make their decision is also
   important, especially in information system domain. Consequently,
   incremental covering algorithms (CA) can be used to produce simple rules
   to make difficult decisions. Nevertheless, even though using simple CA
   as the base of strong AI agent would be a novel idea but doing so with
   themethods available in CA is not possible. It was found that having to
   accurately update the discovered rules based on new information in CA is
   a challenge and needs extra attention. In specific, incomplete data with
   missing classes is inappropriately considered, whereby the speed and
   data size was also a concern, and future none existing classes were
   neglected. Consequently, this paper will introduce a novel algorithm
   called RULES-IT, in order to solve the problems of incremental CA and
   introduce it into strong AI. This algorithm is the first incremental
   algorithm in its family, and CA as a whole, that transfer rules of
   different domains to improve the performance, generalize the induction,
   take advantage of past experience in different domain, and make the
   learner more intelligent. It is also the first to introduce intelligent
   aspects into incremental CA, including consciousness, subjective
   emotions, awareness, and adjustment. Furthermore, all decisions made can
   be understood due to the simple representation of repository as rules.
   Finally, RULES-IT performance will be benchmarked with six different
   methods and compared with its predecessors to see the effect of
   transferring rules in the learning process, and to prove how RULES-IT
   actually solved the shortcoming of current incremental CA in addition to
   its improvement in the total performance.}},

Abstract = {{Coronary heart disease is a great concern in the field of healthcare,
   and one of the main causes of death across the world. In the USA, as in
   Europe, it is responsible for the highest mortality rate. Although the
   risk of coronary heart disease has been recognized, few studies have
   been conducted on this topic. On the other hand, computer science has
   become an important part of our lives. The use of medicine and medical
   science-related artificial intelligence facilitating the diagnosis and
   analysis of diseases and health problems is attracting considerable
   attention. The present study focuses on the determination of the optimum
   method for using artificial intelligence in a clinical decision support
   system in order to provide a solution and diagnosis regarding the
   research and medical issues related to the application of such a system.
   In the present study, we have developed a prediction model capable of
   the risk assessment of coronary heart disease by optimizing an
   adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA) on the basis of the dataset of Korean
   National Health and Nutrition Examinations Survey V. The ANFIS-LDA
   method, which is optimized using a hybrid method, exhibits a high
   prediction rate of 80.2 \% and is more efficient and effective than the
   existing methods. We expect that our study to contribute to the
   prevention of coronary heart disease.}},

Abstract = {{The considerable mathematical knowledge encoded by the Flyspeck project
   is combined with external automated theorem provers (ATPs) and

   architecture is evaluated in a bootstrapping scenario emulating the
   development of Flyspeck from axioms to the last theorem, each time using
   only the previous theorems and proofs. It is shown that 39 \% of the
   14185 theorems could be proved in a push-button mode (without any
   high-level advice and user interaction) in 30 seconds of real time on a
   fourteen-CPU workstation. The necessary work involves: (i) an
   implementation of sound translations of the HOL Light logic to ATP
   formalisms: untyped first-order, polymorphic typed first-order, and
   typed higher-order, (ii) export of the dependency information from HOL
   Light and ATP proofs for the machine learners, and (iii) choice of
   suitable representations and methods for learning from previous proofs,

Title = {{A novel approach to dynamic portfolio trading system using multitree
   genetic programming}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic portfolio trading system is used to allocate one's capital to a
   number of securities through time in a way to maximize the portfolio
   return and to minimize the portfolio risk. Genetic programming (GP) as
   an artificial intelligence technique has been used successfully in the
   financial field, especially for the forecasting tasks in the financial
   markets. In this paper, GP is used to develop a dynamic portfolio
   trading system to capture dynamics of stock market prices through time.
   The proposed approach takes an integrated view on multiple stocks when
   the GP evolves and generates a rule base for dynamic portfolio trading
   based on the technical indices. In the present research, a multitree GP
   forest has been developed to extend the GP structure to extract multiple
   trading rules from historical data. Furthermore, the consequent part of
   each trading rule includes a function rather than a constant value.
   Besides, the transaction cost of trading which plays an important role
   in the profitability of a dynamic portfolio trading system is taken into
   account. This model was used to develop dynamic portfolio trading
   systems. The profitability of the model was examined for both the
   emerging and the mature markets. The numerical results show that the
   proposed model significantly outperforms other traditional models of
   dynamic and static portfolio selection in terms of the portfolio return
   and risk adjusted return. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{XML Matchers: Approaches and challenges}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{190-209}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Schema Matching, i.e. the process of discovering semantic
   correspondences between concepts adopted in different data source
   schemas, has been a key topic in Database and Artificial Intelligence
   research areas for many years. In the past, it was largely investigated
   especially for classical database models (e.g., E/R schemas, relational
   databases, etc.). However, in the latest years, the widespread adoption
   of XML in the most disparate application fields pushed a growing number
   of researchers to design XML-specific Schema Matching approaches, called
   XML Matchers, aiming at finding semantic matchings between concepts
   defined in DTDs and XSDs. XML Matchers do not just take well-known
   techniques originally designed for other data models and apply them on
   DTDs/XSDs, but they exploit specific XML features (e.g., the
   hierarchical structure of a DTD/XSD) to improve the performance of the
   Schema Matching process. The design of XML Matchers is currently a
   well-established research area. The main goal of this paper is to
   provide a detailed description and classification of XML Matchers. We
   first describe to what extent the specificities of DTDs/XSDs impact on
   the Schema Matching task. Then we introduce a template, called XML
   Matcher Template, that describes the main components of an XML Matcher,
   their role and behavior. We illustrate how each of these components has
   been implemented in some popular XML Matchers. We consider our XML
   Matcher Template as the baseline for objectively comparing approaches
   that, at first glance, might appear as unrelated. The introduction of
   this template can be useful in the design of future XML Matchers.
   Finally, we analyze commercial tools implementing XML Matchers and
   introduce two challenging issues strictly related to this topic, namely
   XML source clustering and uncertainty management in XML Matchers. (C)

Abstract = {{The potential of integrating multiagent systems and virtual environments
   has not been exploited to its whole extent. This paper proposes a model
   based on grammars, called Minerva, to construct complex virtual
   environments that integrate the features of agents. A virtual world is
   described as a set of dynamic and static elements. The static part is
   represented by a sequence of primitives and transformations and the
   dynamic elements by a series of agents. Agent activation and
   communication is achieved using events, created by the so-called event
   generators. The grammar defines a descriptive language with a simple
   syntax and a semantics, defined by functions. The semantics functions
   allow the scene to be displayed in a graphics device, and the
   description of the activities of the agents, including artificial
   intelligence algorithms and reactions to physical phenomena. To
   illustrate the use of Minerva, a practical example is presented: a
   simple robot simulator that considers the basic features of a typical
   robot. The result is a functional simple simulator. Minerva is a
   reusable, integral, and generic system, which can be easily scaled,
   adapted, and improved. The description of the virtual scene is
   independent from its representation and the elements that it interacts
   with.}},

Pages = {{839-849}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Context: Software Reliability (SR) is a highly active and dynamic
   research area. Published papers have approached this topic from various
   and heterogeneous points of view, resulting in a rich body of literature
   on this topic. The counterpart to this is the considerable complexity of
   this body of knowledge.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to obtain a panorama and a
   taxonomy of Software Reliability Modeling (SRM).
   Method: In order to do this, a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) which
   analyzes and structures the literature on Software Reliability Modeling
   has been carried out.
   Results: A total of 972 works were obtained as a result of the
   Systematic Mapping Study. On the basis of the more than 500 selected
   primary studies found, the results obtained show an increasing diversity
   of work.
   Conclusion: Although it was discovered that Software Reliability Growth
   Models (SRGM) are still the most common modeling technique, it was also
   found that both the modeling based on static and architectural
   characteristics and the models based on Artificial Intelligence and
   automatic learning techniques are increasingly more apparent in
   literature. We have also observed that most Software Reliability
   Modeling efforts take place in the Pacific Rim area and in academic
   environments. Industrial initiatives are as yet marginal, and would
   appear to be primarily located in the USA. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The paper presents the application of statistical
   (econometrics-originated) methods to process learning and testing data
   sets used by the artificial intelligence (AI) methods in the diagnostics
   of analog systems. Before the training and evaluation of the intelligent
   module is performed, the measurement data are analysed to minimize the
   number of attributes (symptoms) required to distinguish between
   different states of the System Under Test (SUT). This way the knowledge
   extracted from the set is simplified, increasing the operation speed and
   minimizing the threat of overlearning. Also, elimination of unnecessary
   symptoms from the set allows for decreasing the set of test points where
   measurements are taken (which is economically desirable). Preprocessing
   operations include elimination of constant or quasi-stationary symptoms
   and finding their minimal set, allowing for the efficient fault
   detection or parameter identification. The paper focuses on the Hellwig
   and Multiple Correlation Coefficient methods adjusted to the technical
   diagnostics applications. They are implemented to optimize data sets
   obtained from simulation of the fifth order lowpass filter. Their
   usefulness is tested using the artificial neural network (ANN) and Rough

Abstract = {{This paper proposes Bayesian networks (BNs) that combine polarization
   corrected temperature (PCT) and scattering index (SI) methods to
   identify rainfall intensity. To learn BN network structures,
   meta-heuristic techniques including tabu search (TS), simulated
   annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA) were empirically evaluated and
   compared for efficiency. The proposed models were applied to the Tanshui
   river basin in Taiwan. The meteorological data from the Special Sensor
   Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) comprises seven passive microwave brightness
   temperatures, and was used to detect rain rates. The data consisted of
   71 typhoons affecting the watershed during 2000-2012. A preliminary
   analysis using simple meta-heuristic BNs identified the main attributes,
   namely the brightness temperatures of 19,22,37 and 85 GHz for rainfall
   retrieval. Based on the preliminary analysis of a simple BN run, the
   advanced BNs combined with SI and PCT successfully demonstrated improved
   rain rate retrieval accuracy. To compare the proposed meta-heuristic
   BNs, the traditional SI method, the SI-based support vector regression
   model (SI-SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) were used as
   benchmarks. The results showed that (1) meta-heuristic BN techniques can
   be used to identify the vital attributes of the rainfall retrieval
   problem and their causal relationships and (2) according to a comparison
   of BNs combined with PCT and SI and artificial intelligence (AI)-based
   models (SI-SVR and ANN), in heavy, torrential, and pouring rainfall,
   models of BNs combined with PCT and SI provide a superior retrieval
   performance than that of AI-based models. Therefore, this study confirms
   that meta-heuristic BNs combined with PCT and SI is an efficient tool
   for addressing rainfall retrieval problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The rapid integration of physical systems with cyberspace
   infrastructure, the so-called Internet of Things, is likely to have a
   significant effect on how people interact with the physical environment
   and design information and communication systems. Internet-connected
   systems are expected to vastly outnumber people on the planet in the
   near future, leading to grand challenges in software engineering and
   automation in application domains involving complex and evolving
   systems. Several decades of artificial intelligence research suggests
   that conventional approaches to making such systems automatically
   interoperable using handcrafted ``semantic{''} descriptions of services
   and information are difficult to apply. In this paper we outline a
   bioinspired learning approach to creating interoperable systems, which
   does not require handcrafted semantic descriptions and rules. Instead,
   the idea is that a functioning system (of systems) can emerge from an
   initial pseudorandom state through learning from examples, provided that
   each component conforms to a set of information coding rules. We combine
   a binary vector symbolic architecture (VSA) with an associative memory
   known as sparse distributed memory (SDM) to model context-dependent

Abstract = {{Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is an analogical reasoning method, which
   solves problems by relating some previously solved problems to a current
   unsolved problem to draw analogical inferences for problem solving. But
   CBR faces the challenge of assigning weights to the features to measure
   similarity between a current unsolved case and cases stored in the case
   base effectively and correctly. The concept of neural network's pruning
   is already used to sort out feature weighting problem in CBR. But it
   loses generality and actual elicited knowledge in the ANN's links. This
   work proposes a method to extract symbolic weights from a trained neural
   network by observing the whole trained neural network as an AND/OR graph
   and then finds solution for each node that becomes the weight of a
   corresponding node. The proposed feature weighting mechanism is used in
   CBR to build a hybrid expert system for classification task and the
   performance of the proposed hybrid system is compared with that with
   other feature weighting mechanisms. The performance is validated on
   swine flu dataset and ionosphere, sonar and heart datasets collected
   from UCI repository. From the empirical results it is observed that in
   all the experiments the proposed feature weighting mechanism outperforms
   most of the earlier weighting mechanisms extracted from trained neural
   network. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Computational metacognition is a technical area of artificial
   intelligence whose aim is to increase the degree of autonomy and
   awareness an intelligent system has about its own reasoning and
   learning. In the literature, different models of metacognition are
   applied to artificial intelligent systems. However many of these models
   have a narrow focus, because they do not address comprehensively the
   elements of metacognition. This paper presents an analysis of
   metacognitive models discussed in the literature in order to discover
   the common (invariants) and varying (variants) elements. The main
   contribution of this work is the development of a comprehensive and
   general purpose metamodel named MISM that covers and describes a broad
   range of commonly referenced concepts in metacognitive models in the
   area of artificial intelligence. A validation process was conducted to
   ensure the reliability of MISM in terms of generality, expressiveness
   and completeness. The validation was performed using three techniques
   for improvements and adjustments to the metamodel: (i) comparison with
   other models; (ii) frequency-based selection; and (iii) model tracing.
   The adjusted and improved version of the metamodel was named MISM 1.1.

Abstract = {{Within the context of constraint solving, a portfolio approach allows
   one to exploit the synergy between different solvers in order to create

   solvers in order to compute - without learning an explicit model - a
   schedule of them for solving a given Constraint Satisfaction Problem
   (CSP). Motivated by the performance reached by SUNNY vs. different
   simulations of other state of the art approaches, we developed
   sunny-csp, an effective portfolio solver that exploits the underlying
   SUNNY algorithm in order to solve a given CSP. Empirical tests conducted
   on exhaustive benchmarks of MiniZinc models show that the actual
   performance of sunny-csp conforms to the predictions. This is
   encouraging both for improving the power of CSP portfolio solvers and
   for trying to export them to fields such as Answer Set Programming and

Abstract = {{Lifted inference has been proposed for various probabilistic logical
   frameworks in order to compute the probability of queries in a time that
   depends on the size of the domains of the random variables rather than
   the number of instances. Even if various authors have underlined its
   importance for probabilistic logic programming (PLP), lifted inference
   has been applied up to now only to relational languages outside of logic
   programming. In this paper we adapt Generalized Counting First Order
   Variable Elimination (GC-FOVE) to the problem of computing the
   probability of queries to probabilistic logic programs under the
   distribution semantics. In particular, we extend the Prolog Factor
   Language (PFL) to include two new types of factors that are needed for
   representing ProbLog programs. These factors take into account the
   existing causal independence relationships among random variables and
   are managed by the extension to variable elimination proposed by Zhang
   and Poole for dealing with convergent variables and heterogeneous
   factors. Two new operators are added to GC-FOVE for treating
   heterogeneous factors. The resulting algorithm, called LP2 for Lifted
   Probabilistic Logic Programming, has been implemented by modifying the
   PFL implementation of GC-FOVE and tested on three benchmarks for lifted
   inference. A comparison with PITA and ProbLog2 shows the potential of
   the approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper resolves a common complexity issue in the Bethe approximation
   of statistical physics and the belief propagation (BP) algorithm of
   artificial intelligence. The Bethe approximation and the BP algorithm
   are heuristic methods for estimating the partition function and marginal
   probabilities in graphical models, respectively. The computational
   complexity of the Bethe approximation is decided by the number of
   operations required to solve a set of nonlinear equations, the so-called
   Bethe equation. Although the BP algorithm was inspired and developed
   independently, Yedidia, Freeman, and Weiss showed that the BP algorithm
   solves the Bethe equation if it converges (however, it often does not).
   This naturally motivates the following question to understand
   limitations and empirical successes of the Bethe and BP methods: is the
   Bethe equation computationally easy to solve? We present a
   message-passing algorithm solving the Bethe equation in a polynomial
   number of operations for general binary graphical models of n variables,
   where the maximum degree in the underlying graph is O(log n).
   Equivalently, it finds a stationary point of the Bethe free energy
   function. Our algorithm can be used as an alternative to BP fixing its
   convergence issue and is the first fully polynomial-time approximation
   scheme for the BP fixed-point computation in such a large class of
   graphical models, whereas the approximate fixed-point computation is
   known to be polynomial parity arguments on directed graphs (PPAD-) hard
   in general. We believe that our technique is of broader interest to
   understand the computational complexity of the cavity method in
   statistical physics.}},

Abstract = {{Biometrical systems are of the most interesting research subject matters
   in the last years. Face biometrics is noteworthy one because of its
   simple accessibility, easy usage and the ability of better acceptance by
   persons. The process of facial recognition includes these phases:
   Pre-processing of images, extracting important properties of the face,
   and finally, the classification of these properties. There are many
   researches carried out in this area, each of which employed different
   methods for mentioned phases. According to the previous applications of
   the methods, which have been done by artificial immune network, and to
   its relatively good results in optimization problems, machine learning,
   pattern recognition, data search, data clustering and so on, in this
   research facial verification through classification by artificial immune
   Network (aiNET) has been surveyed. In this article, databank Yale has
   been used and the statistical properties such as maximum, minimum,
   variance and energy of wavelet coefficients in different compositions
   have been examined. In order to validation, we have used the Cross
   Validation method that its best results in the case of using the
   ten-fold or leave one out method, were FAR=2.1 \%, FRR=0.9\%, and

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In many supervised learning problems, determining the true labels of
   training instances is expensive, laborious, and even practically
   impossible. As an alternative approach, it is much easier to collect
   multiple subjective (possibly noisy) labels from human labelers,
   especially with the crowdsourcing services such as Amazon's Mechanical
   Turk. The collected labels are then aggregated to estimate the true
   labels. In order to reduce the negative effects of novices, spammers,
   and malicious labelers, it necessitates taking into account the
   accuracies of the labelers. However, in the absence of true labels, we
   miss the main source of information to estimate the labeler accuracies.
   This paper demonstrates that the agreements or disagreements among
   labeler opinions are useful sources of information and facilitate the
   accuracy estimation problem. We represent this estimation problem as an
   optimization problem which its goal is to minimize the differences
   between the analytical probabilities of disagreements based on estimated
   accuracies and the probabilities of disagreements according to the
   provided labels. We present an efficient semi-exhaustive search method
   to solve this optimization problem. Our experiments on the simulated
   data and three real datasets show that the proposed method is a
   promising idea in this emerging new area. The source code of the
   proposed method is available for downloading at

Abstract = {{Owing to the random nature of the lightning phenomenon, the statistical
   based methods such as Monte Carlo simulation are the best tool to
   perform the lightning-related studies. However, Monte Carlo simulation
   is complex and time consuming, especially, for larger networks where a
   lot of regions must be investigated, separately. Although some
   researches have been carried out to evaluate the lightning flashover
   outage rates based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, but, so
   far, any work has not been reported to perform a risk assessment of
   lightning surges by means of AI. This study presents a meta-model based
   on adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that can be utilised
   to perform the lightning-related risk analysis with a good accuracy. The
   inputs of ANFIS are tower footing resistance, critical flashover voltage
   and the rate of lightning occurrence; and its outputs include the
   failure risk of both the insulation and arrester. The trained ANFIS can
   be very efficient in terms of time and computational resources for the
   further analysis, like placement of arresters or insulation coordination
   studies, on the electrical network on which the training is performed.
   To demonstrate the effectiveness of the ANFIS meta-model, an
   optimisation method, based on genetic algorithm, has been implemented in
   order to find the optimum location of a specified set of line arresters
   on power network. Also, in order to consider the environmental
   condition, that is, pollution and altitude, a new method to determine
   the importance of each node of interest in protection is introduced.}},

Abstract = {{Resource allocation has been a critical issue in manufacturing. This
   paper presents an intelligent data management induced resource
   allocation system (RAS) which aims at providing effective and timely
   decision making for resource allocation. This sophisticated system is
   comprised of product materials, people, information, control and
   supporting function for the effectiveness in production. The said system
   incorporates a Database Management System (DBMS) and fuzzy logic to
   analyze data for intelligent decision making, and Radio Frequency
   Identification (RFID) for result verification. Numerical data from
   diverse sources are managed in the DBMS and used for resource allocation
   determination by using fuzzy logic. The output, representing the
   essential resources level for production, is then verified with
   reference to the resource utilization status captured by RFID. The
   effectiveness of the developed system is verified with a case study
   carried out in a Hong Kong-based garment manufacturing company. Results
   show that data gathering before resource allocation determination is
   more efficient with the use of developed system where the resource
   allocation decision parameters in the centralize database are
   effectively determined by using fuzzy logic. Decision makers such as
   production managers are allowed to determine resource allocation in a
   standardized approach in a more efficient way. The system also
   incorporates RFID with Artificial Intelligence techniques for result
   verification and knowledge refinement. Therefore, fuzzy logic results of
   resource allocation can be more responsive and adaptive to the actual
   production situation by refining the fuzzy rules with reference to the
   RFID-captured data. (C) 2014 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

Abstract = {{Drilling is one of the important machining processes performed
   extensively in production industry. Literature emphasises that the
   output process parameters such as burr height, surface roughness,
   strength, etc. are related to and can be improved by the appropriate
   settings of the input process parameters. Recently, researchers have
   applied well-known computational intelligence methods such as regression
   analysis, artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector regression
   (SVR), etc. in the prediction of performance characteristics of the
   drilling process. Alternatively, an evolutionary approach of multi-gene
   genetic programming (MGGP) that evolves the model structure and its
   coefficients automatically can be applied. Despite of being widely
   applied, MGGP has the limitation for producing models that over-fit on
   the testing data. One of the reasons attributed for this behaviour is
   the over-size of the evolved models. Therefore, a statistical-based MGGP
   (S-MGGP) approach is proposed and applied to the burr height data
   obtained from the drilling of AISI 316L stainless steel. In this
   proposed approach, Bayesian information criterion is embedded in its
   paradigm, which punishes the fitness of larger size models. The
   performance of S-MGGP and ANN models is found to be better than those of
   the standardised MGGP and SVR. Further, the parametric and sensitivity
   analysis conducted validates the robustness of our proposed model and is
   proved to capture the dynamics of the drilling phenomenon by unveiling
   dominant input process parameters and the hidden non-linear
   relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid system is a potential tool to deal with construction engineering
   and management problems. This study proposes an optimized hybrid
   artificial intelligence model to integrate a fast messy genetic
   algorithm (fmGA) with a support vector machine (SVM). The fmGA-based SVM

   initial phase of public-private partnership projects. Particularly, the
   SVM mainly provides learning and curve fitting while the fmGA optimizes
   SVM parameters. Measures in term of accuracy, precision, sensitivity,
   specificity, and area under the curve and synthesis index are used for
   performance evaluation of proposed hybrid intelligence classification
   model. Experimental comparisons indicate that GASVM achieves better
   cross-fold prediction accuracy compared to other baseline models (i.e.,
   CART, CHAID, QUEST, and C5.0) and previous works. The forecasting

Abstract = {{Road traffic represents the main source of noise in urban environments
   that is proven to significantly affect human mental and physical health
   and labour productivity. Thus, in order to control noise sound level in
   urban areas, it is very important to develop methods for modelling the
   road traffic noise. As observed in the literature, the models that deal
   with this issue are mainly based on regression analysis, while other
   approaches are very rare. In this paper a novel approach for modelling
   traffic noise that is based on optimization is presented. Four
   optimization techniques were used in simulation in this work: genetic
   algorithms, Hooke and Jeeves algorithm, simulated annealing and particle
   swarm optimization. Two different scenarios are presented in this paper.
   In the first scenario the optimization methods use the whole measurement
   dataset to find the most suitable parameters, whereas in the second
   scenario optimized parameters were found using only some of the
   measurement data, while the rest of the data was used to evaluate the
   predictive capabilities of the model. The goodness of the model is
   evaluated by the coefficient of determination and other statistical
   parameters, and results show agreement of high extent between measured
   data and calculated values in both scenarios. In addition, the model was

Abstract = {{The success of a behavior-based system relies largely on its Action
   Selection Mechanism (ASM) module, which is basically a behavior
   coordination method of either arbitration or command fusion type.
   Deciding on the right coordination method for ASM when executing a given
   mission in an arbitrary environment can be a huge obstacle. Providing
   the system with some kind of Artificial Intelligence (Al) to deal with
   the dynamics of a given task would be highly recommended. In this paper,
   an evolutionary process has been employed in a behavior-based system to
   generate a suitable ASM based on a system's mission scenario. A Genetic
   Algorithm (GA) is used to train the weights of a Multi-layer Perceptron
   (MLP) feed-forward artificial neural network in identifying a suitable
   formulation of ASM. Implementation of such systems in a target tracking
   mission has shown positive results. Depending on the mission scenario,
   the evolved ASM can dynamically manage the coordination method in order
   to achieve the overall system objective. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{An artificial bee colony algorithm for image contrast enhancement}},
Journal = {{SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{69-84}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Image Enhancement is a crucial phase in almost every image processing
   system. It aims at improving both the visual and the informational
   quality of distorted images. Histogram Equalization (HE) techniques are
   the most popular approaches for image enhancement for they succeed in
   enhancing the image and preserving its main characteristics. However,
   using exhaustive approaches for histogram equalisation is an
   algorithmically complex task. These HE techniques also fail in offering
   good enhancement if not so good parameters are chosen. So, new
   intelligent approaches, using Artificial Intelligence techniques, have
   been proposed for image enhancement. In this context, this paper
   proposes a new Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm for image contrast
   enhancement. A grey-level mapping technique and a new image quality
   measure are used. The algorithm has been tested on some test images, and
   the comparisons of the obtained results with the genetic algorithm have
   proven its superiority. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has been
   extended to colour image enhancement and given very promising results.
   Further qualitative and statistical comparisons of the proposed ABC to
   the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm are also presented in the paper; not
   only for the adopted grey-level mapping technique, but also with using
   another common transformation, generally called the local/global
   transformation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A neural cognitive model of argumentation with application to legal
   inference and decision making}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED LOGIC}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{109-127}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Formal models of argumentation have been investigated in several areas,
   from multi-agent systems and artificial intelligence (Al) to decision
   making, philosophy and law. In artificial intelligence, logic-based
   models have been the standard for the representation of argumentative
   reasoning. More recently, the standard logic-based models have been
   shown equivalent to standard connectionist models. This has created a
   new line of research where (i) neural networks can be used as a parallel
   computational model for argumentation and (ii) neural networks can be
   used to combine argumentation, quantitative reasoning and statistical
   learning. At the same time, non-standard logic models of argumentation
   started to emerge. In this paper, we propose a connectionist cognitive
   model of argumentation that accounts for both standard and non-standard
   forms of argumentation. The model is shown to be an adequate framework
   for dealing with standard and non-standard argumentation, including
   joint-attacks, argument support, ordered attacks, disjunctive attacks,
   meta-level attacks, self-defeating attacks, argument accrual and
   uncertainty. We show that the neural cognitive approach offers an
   adequate way of modelling all of these different aspects of
   argumentation. We have applied the framework to the modelling of a
   public prosecution charging decision as part of a real legal decision
   making case study containing many of the above aspects of argumentation.
   The results show that the model can be a useful tool in the analysis of
   legal decision making, including the analysis of what-if questions and
   the analysis of alternative conclusions. The approach opens up two new
   perspectives in the short-term: the use of neural networks for computing
   prevailing arguments efficiently through the propagation in parallel of
   neuronal activations, and the use of the same networks to evolve the
   structure of the argumentation network through learning (e.g. to learn
   the strength of arguments from data). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Face recognition plays an important role in security applications, but
   in real-world conditions face images are typically subject to issues
   that compromise recognition performance, such as geometric
   transformations, occlusions and changes in illumination. Most face
   detection and recognition works to date deal with single face images
   using global features and supervised learning. Differently from that
   context, here we propose a multiple face recognition approach based on
   local features which does not rely on supervised learning. In order to
   deal with multiple face images under varying conditions, the extraction
   of invariant and discriminative local features is achieved by using the
   SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features) approach, and the search for regions
   from which optimal features can be extracted is done by an improved ABC
   (Artificial Bee Colony) algorithm. Thresholds and parameters for SURF
   and improved ABC algorithms are determined experimentally. The approach
   was extensively assessed on 99 different still images - more than 400
   trials were conducted using 20 target face images and still images under
   different acquisition conditions. Results show that our approach is
   promising for real-world face recognition applications concerning
   different acquisition conditions and transformations.}},

   reduction in OFDM systems}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel genetic algorithm assisted partial transmit
   sequence (NGA-PTS) is proposed to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio
   (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). However,
   the search complexity of the optimum PTS (OPTS) scheme is too large for
   the typical number of sub-blocks. Therefore, some artificial
   intelligence methods, such as genetic algorithm technique, and particle
   swarm optimization, are introduced to reduce the complexity. As
   traditional GA-PTS (TGA-PTS) technique risks finding a suboptimal
   solution, how to avoid this disadvantage of TGA-PTS is an interest
   topic. In order to obtain a better suboptimal solution, a phase factor
   optimal pair technique and an abandon/introduction new chromosome
   technique are proposed in GA here. Simulation results show that the
   proposed scheme achieves a significant improvement over the TGA-PTS
   scheme in PAPR. Furthermore, by use of the inherent diversity of
   constellation for each OFDM candidate, in the receiver part, the
   proposed scheme enables data recovery without any side information.
   Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents Comme il Faut (CiF), an artificial intelligence
   system that matches character performances to appropriate social
   context, with the goal of enabling authors to write high-level rules
   governing expected character behavior in given social situations, rather
   than specific fixed choice points in a curated narrative structure. CiF
   models characters with a complex set of traits, feelings, and
   relationships, who can form intents, take actions, relate to a shared
   cultural space, and remember and refer to past events. A set of authored
   rules encoding appropriate behavior within a specific story world allow
   these characters to select actions to take (and respond to actions by
   others) in a manner consistent with their own personal and social
   concerns as well as a shifting interpersonal context. Through the
   development and release of Prom Week, a complete game using CiF as its
   narrative engine, we show how the system successfully creates complex
   narratives that are unique for each player and directed by those
   players' attempts to make progress towards story goals. We also show how
   CiF continues to be used in several in-progress interactive experiences
   (Mismanor and IMMERSE), speaking to the utility and flexibility of its
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Automated sports commentary is a form of automated narrative. Sports
   commentary exists to keep the viewer informed and entertained. One way
   to entertain the viewer is by telling brief stories relevant to the game
   in progress. We present a system called the sports commentary
   recommendation system (SCoReS) that can automatically suggest stories
   for commentators to tell during games. Through several user studies, we
   compared commentary using SCoReS to three other types of commentary and
   show that SCoReS adds significantly to the broadcast across several
   enjoyment metrics. We also collected interview data from professional
   sports commentators who positively evaluated a demonstration of the
   system. We conclude that SCoReS can be a useful broadcast tool,
   effective at selecting stories that add to the enjoyment and
   watchability of sports. SCoReS is a step toward automating sports
   commentary and, thus, automating narrative.}},

Abstract = {{Scott Turner's Minstrel is considered a landmark story-generation
   system, cited as an important system in our field's history for the
   quality of its output. Other influential systems such as Meehan's
   Tale-Spin have inspired modern successors, but although a few systems
   have followed Minstrel's case-based approach, none of them use its
   ``imaginative recall{''} technique. This paper details Skald, a
   publicly-released rational reconstruction of Minstrel that enables
   exploration of Turner's work and discovery of new implications for
   future research. A key finding is a brittleness only hinted at in
   Turner's publications: the story library, story templates, and the
   recall system must be tailored to one another for Turner's original
   system to function. We show that this can be ameliorated through a
   number of techniques, however, from adding differential costs to
   transformations to removing the least-successful author-level actions.
   Another key finding is that Turner's original ``boredom{''} system
   limited leverage of the story library. An alternative and its results
   are presented here. What emerges from this work is a different picture
   of the original Minstrel than that currently present in the literature,
   as well as a new system, Skald, that sets the stage for future research
   to explore Turner's ideas for story generation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present computational models for generating influence
   that allow story managers to shape players' decisions in interactive
   narrative experiences. Our approach uses concepts from social
   psychology, discourse analysis, and natural language generation. We
   describe an abstract formalism to operationalize tools of social
   psychological influence described by Cialdini (Influence: The Psychology
   of Persuasion, NewYork, NY, USA: Harper-Collins, 1998) and evaluate two
   example implementations that enable a storytelling system to generate
   influence on the fly (with varying degrees of success), thereby adapting
   stories to realize goals specified by authors. These implementations are
   used in an interactive story where influence is generated dynamically as
   players' experiences unfold. We present the results of a user study to
   characterize the effectiveness of these models. Results did not indicate
   the presence of any significant differences in players' sense of control
   over the story with, or without, the use of influence. Further, the use
   of influence resulted in a set of stories experienced by players that
   more closely matched the author's goals.}},

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{KANTS is a swarm intelligence clustering algorithm inspired by the
   behavior of social insects. It uses stigmergy as a strategy for
   clustering large datasets and, as a result, displays a typical behavior
   of complex systems: self-organization and global patterns emerging from
   the local interaction of simple units. This paper introduces a
   simplified version of KANTS and describes recent experiments with the
   algorithm in the context of a contemporary artistic and scientific trend
   called swarm art, a type of generative art in which swarm intelligence
   systems are used to create artwork or ornamental objects. KANTS is used
   here for generating color drawings from the input data that represent
   real-world phenomena, such as electroencephalogram sleep data. However,
   the main proposal of this paper is an art project based on well-known
   abstract paintings, from which the chromatic values are extracted and
   used as input. Colors and shapes are therefore reorganized by KANTS,
   which generates its own interpretation of the original artworks. The
   project won the 2012 Evolutionary Art, Design, and Creativity

Abstract = {{This paper presents the Self-Sorting Map (SSM), a novel algorithm for
   organizing and presenting multimedia data. Given a set of data items and
   a dissimilarity measure between each pair of them, the SSM places each
   item into a unique cell of a structured layout, where the most related
   items are placed together and the unrelated ones are spread apart. The
   algorithm integrates ideas from dimension reduction, sorting, and data
   clustering algorithms. Instead of solving the continuous optimization
   problem that other dimension reduction approaches do, the SSM transforms
   it into a discrete labeling problem. As a result, it can organize a set
   of data into a structured layout without overlap, providing a simple and
   intuitive presentation. The algorithm is designed for sorting all data
   items in parallel, making it possible to arrange millions of items in
   seconds. Experiments on different types of data demonstrate the SSM's
   versatility in a variety of applications, ranging from positioning city
   names by proximities to presenting images according to visual
   similarities, to visualizing semantic relatedness between Wikipedia

Abstract = {{Radio frequency identification (RFID) is rapidly growing into an
   important technology for object identification and tracking
   applications. This gives rise to the most challenging RFID network
   planning (RNP) problem in the large-scale RFID deployment environment.
   RNP has been proven to be an NP-hard problem that involves many
   objectives and constraints. The application of evolutionary and swarm
   intelligence algorithms for solving multi-objective RNP (MORNP) has
   gained significant attention in the literature, while these proposed
   methods always transform multi-objective RNP into single-objective
   problem by the weighted coefficient approach. In this work, we propose a
   cooperative multi-objective artificial colony algorithm called CMOABC to
   find all the Pareto optimal solutions and to achieve the optimal
   planning solutions by simultaneously optimizing four conflicting
   objectives in MORNP. The experiment presents an exhaustive comparison of
   the proposed CMOABC and two successful multi-bjective techniques, namely
   the recently developed multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm
   (MOABC) and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), on
   instances of different nature, namely the two-objective and
   three-objective MORNP in the large-scale RFID scenario. Simulation
   results show that CMOABC proves to be superior for planning RFID
   networks compared to NSGA-II and MOABC in terms of optimization accuracy
   and computation robustness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique to
   train an artificial neural network (ANN) for prediction of flank wear in
   drilling, and compares the network performance with that of the back
   propagation neural network (BPNN). This analysis is carried out
   following a series of experiments employing high speed steel (HSS)
   drills for drilling on mild steel workpieces, under different sets of
   cutting conditions and noting the root mean square (RMS) value of
   spindle motor current as well as the average flank wear in each case.
   The results show that the PSO trained ANN not only gives better
   prediction results and reduced computational times compared to the BPNN,
   it is also a more robust model, being free of getting trapped in local
   optimum solutions unlike the latter. Besides, it offers the advantages
   of a straight-forward logic, simple realization and underlying
   intelligence.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{63-73}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In a world where resources are scarce and urban areas consume the vast
   majority of these resources, it is vital to make cities greener and more
   sustainable. A smart city is a city in which information and
   communications technology are merged with traditional infrastructures,
   coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies. The
   increasing amount of waste generated, and the collection and treatment
   of waste poses a major challenge to modern urban planning in general,
   and to smart cities in particular. To cope with this problem, automated
   vacuum waste collection (AVWC) uses air suction on a closed network of
   underground pipes to transport waste from the drop off points scattered
   throughout the city to a central collection point, reducing greenhouse
   gas emissions and the inconveniences of conventional methods (odours,
   noise, etc.). Since a significant part of the cost of operating AVWC
   systems is energy consumption, we have developed a model with the aim of
   applying constraint programming technology to schedule the daily
   emptying sequences of the drop off points in such a way that energy
   consumption is minimized. In this paper we describe how the problem of
   deciding the drop off points that should be emptied at a given time can
   be modeled as a constraint integer programming (CIP) problem. Moreover,
   we report on experiments using real data from AVWC systems installed in
   different cities that provide empirical evidence that CIP offers a
   suitable technology for reducing energy consumption in AVWC. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Developing effective artificial intelligence tools to find motifs in
   DNA, RNA and proteins poses a challenging yet important problem in life
   science research. In this paper, we present a computational approach for
   finding RNA tertiary motifs in genomic sequences. Specifically, we
   predict genomic coordinate locations for coaxial helical stackings in
   3-way RNA junctions. These predictions are provided by our tertiary
   motif search package, named CSminer, which utilizes two versatile
   methodologies: random forests and covariance models. A coaxial helical
   stacking tertiary motif occurs in a 3-way RNA junction where two
   separate helical elements form a pseudocontiguous helix and provide
   thermodynamic stability to the RNA molecule as a whole. Our CSminer tool
   first uses a genome-wide search method based on covariance models to
   find a genomic region that may potentially contain a coaxial helical
   stacking tertiary motif. CSminer then uses a random forests classifier
   to predict whether the genomic region indeed contains the tertiary
   motif. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   approach.}},

   optimum reservoir release policy. From the historical recorded data, the
   monthly inflow was categorized into three states: high, medium and low.
   As a guideline for the decision maker, an optimum release curve was
   generated for each month showing the release options with a variety of
   different storage conditions. GA (real and binary), ABC optimization and
   PSO algorithm have been used as optimization tools with the same
   formulation and objective function for all the methods. For verification
   of the models, a simulation is done by using 264 monthly historical
   inflow data. Different indices such as reliability, vulnerability and
   resiliency were calculated in order to check the performance and risk
   analysis purposes. The results show that the most recently developed ABC
   optimization technique provides the best results in meeting demands,
   avoiding wastage of water and in handling critical period of low flows.}},

Abstract = {{In a mobile service robot, map building is a basis for navigation that
   allows the robot to perform a given task. When robots carry on mission
   planning and execution, they not only need structural information about
   the environment to navigation and self localization, but also need to
   possess a deeper knowledge to endow a robot with higher degrees of
   autonomy and intelligence. In this paper, the QR code based artificial
   labels are used to provide semantic concepts and relations of objects
   and rooms in indoor environments, which can solve the complexity and
   limitations of semantic recognition and scene understanding only with
   robot's vision. Semantic knowledge offered by artificial labels is
   obtained to incarnate semantic representations of the environment, which
   are formed as the semantic map. In order to maintain the navigation
   abilities of the robot, the spatial modeling method of a human is
   imitated to describe the relations of function area as a global
   topological map by the spectrum clustering algorithm. The semantic map
   is combined with topological representations to build a spatial semantic
   hybrid map. Using the hybrid map, `'semantic'' path planning, the
   elementary management of objects, and the context based robot
   localization are studied to show the hybrid map's practicability. The
   results of several experiments show that the spatial semantic hybrid map
   comes up to capture the human point-of-view of robot environments,
   enable a high-level reasonable service path, and achieve function-driven
   navigation. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper addresses fuzzy-logic-based reinforcement learning
   architecture and experimental results for the interaction between an
   artificial robot and a living bio-insect. The main goal of this research
   is to drag the bio-insect towards the desired goal area without any
   human aid. To achieve the goal, we seek to design robot intelligence
   architecture such that the robot can drag the bio-insect using its own
   learning mechanism. The main difficulties of this research are to find
   an interaction mechanism between the robot and bio-insect and to design
   a robot intelligence architecture. In simple interaction experiment, the
   bio-insect does not react to stimuli such as light, vibration, or
   artificial robot motion. From various trials-and-error efforts, we
   empirically found an actuation mechanism for the interaction between the
   robot and bio-insect. Nevertheless, it is difficult to control the
   movement of the bio-insect due to its uncertain and complex behavior.
   For the artificial robot, we design a fuzzy-logic-based reinforcement
   learning architecture that helps the artificial robot learn how to
   control the movement of the bio-insect under uncertain and complex
   behavior. Here, we present the experimental results regarding the
   interaction between an artificial robot and a bio-insect.}},

Abstract = {{Swarm intelligence (SI) is briefly defined as the collective behaviour
   of decentralized and self-organized swarms. The well known examples for
   these swarms are bird flocks, fish schools and the colony of social
   insects such as termites, ants and bees. In 1990s, especially two
   approaches based on ant colony and on fish schooling/bird flocking
   introduced have highly attracted the interest of researchers. Although
   the self-organization features are required by SI are strongly and
   clearly seen in honey bee colonies, unfortunately the researchers have
   recently started to be interested in the behaviour of these swarm
   systems to describe new intelligent approaches, especially from the
   beginning of 2000s. During a decade, several algorithms have been
   developed depending on different intelligent behaviours of honey bee
   swarms. Among those, artificial bee colony (ABC) is the one which has
   been most widely studied on and applied to solve the real world
   problems, so far. Day by day the number of researchers being interested
   in ABC algorithm increases rapidly. This work presents a comprehensive
   survey of the advances with ABC and its applications. It is hoped that
   this survey would be very beneficial for the researchers studying on SI,
   particularly ABC algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an internal model control recurrent neural network method
   is used to control the switching of thyristor-controlled reactor in a
   static VAR compensator (SVC) system for regulating the voltage. The
   novel controller scheme contains several feedback loops instead of only
   a feed-forward loop as in the conventional recurrent neural network
   (RNN). In the proposed controller model, the RNN identifier creates a
   sample of the connected system and its output generates a part of inputs
   for the RNN controller which then sends the control signal to the SVC
   system. Three types of non-linear conditions are chosen to test the
   operational capability of the new control system to perform the voltage
   regulation satisfying the IEEE Std 519-1992. The test cases contain a
   three-phase fault power system, opening of one of the transmission lines
   in a double line transmission system and sudden changes in the load
   demand. Results show that the proposed control model is capable of
   regulating the voltage of the system in a desired range.}},

Abstract = {{The Google Artificial Intelligence (AI) Challenge is an international
   contest the objective of which is to program the AI in a two-player real
   time strategy (RTS) game. This AI is an autonomous computer program that
   governs the actions that one of the two players executes during the game
   according to the state of play. The entries are evaluated via a
   competition mechanism consisting of two-player rounds where each entry
   is tested against others. This paper describes the use of competitive
   coevolutionary (CC) algorithms for the automatic generation of winning
   game strategies in Planet Wars, the RTS game associated with the 2010
   contest. Three different versions of a prime algorithm have been tested.
   Their common nexus is not only the use of a Hall-of-Fame (HoF) to keep
   note of the winners of past coevolutions but also the employment of an
   archive of experienced players, termed the hall-of-celebrities (HoC),
   that puts pressure on the optimization process and guides the search to
   increase the strength of the solutions; their differences come from the
   periodical updating of the HoF on the basis of quality and diversity
   metrics. The goal is to optimize the AI by means of a self-learning
   process guided by coevolutionary search and competitive evaluation. An
   empirical study on the performance of a number of variants of the
   proposed algorithms is described and a statistical analysis of the
   results is conducted. In addition to the attainment of competitive bots
   we also conclude that the incorporation of the HoC inside the primary
   algorithm helps to reduce the effects of cycling caused by the use of
   HoF in CC algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Successful image-based object recognition techniques have been
   constructed founded on powerful techniques such as sparse
   representation, in lieu of the popular vector quantization approach.
   However, one serious drawback of sparse space-based methods is that
   local features that are quite similar can be quantized into quite
   distinct visual words. We address this problem with a novel approach for
   object recognition, called sparse spatial coding, which efficiently
   combines a sparse coding dictionary learning and spatial constraint
   coding stage. We performed experimental evaluation using the Caltech
   101, Caltech 256, Corel 5000, and Corel 10000 data sets, which were
   specifically designed for object recognition evaluation. Our results
   show that our approach achieves high accuracy comparable with the best
   single feature method previously published on those databases. Our
   method outperformed, for the same bases, several multiple feature
   methods, and provided equivalent, and in few cases, slightly less
   accurate results than other techniques specifically designed to that
   end. Finally, we report state-of-the-art results for scene recognition
   on COsy Localization Dataset (COLD) and high performance results on the
   MIT-67 indoor scene recognition, thus demonstrating the generalization
   of our approach for such tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Swarm intelligence, a nature inspired computing applies an algorithm
   situated within the context of agent based models that mimics the
   behavior of ants to detect sinkhole attacks in wireless sensor networks.
   An Ant Colony Optimization Attack Detection (ACO-AD) algorithm is
   proposed to identify the sinkhole attacks based on the nodeids defined
   in the ruleset. The nodes generating an alert on identifying a sinkhole
   attack are grouped together. A voting method is proposed to identify the
   intruder. An Ant Colony Optimization Boolean Expression Evolver Sign
   Generation (ABXES) algorithm is proposed to distribute the keys to the
   alerted nodes in the group for signing the suspect list to agree on the
   intruder. It is shown that the proposed method identifies the anomalous
   connections without generating false positives and minimizes the storage
   in the sensor nodes in comparison to LIDeA architecture for sinkhole
   attack detection. Experimental results demonstrating the Ant Colony
   Optimization approach of detecting a sinkhole attack are presented. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based controller
   for 5-level, cascade H-bridge inverter for harmonic compensation and dc
   voltage regulation under different loading conditions for high voltage
   applications. In the proposed topology, the artificial neural network
   (ANN) is applied for obtaining compensating current and two Fuzzy Logic
   Controllers (FLC) are designed for dc voltage regulation and current
   error adjustment. The fuzzy logic controlled current error is then used
   for multicarrier Phase Shifted Pulse Width Modulation (PSPWM) for
   generating gate pulses for the inverter. The 5-level, Cascade H-bridge
   Multilevel Inverter (CHBMLI) is used as active harmonic filter. The ANN
   based instantaneous power theory is applied for reference current
   estimation. Simulation results are obtained in MATLAB/SIMULINK for diode
   bridge rectifier with RL/RC as nonlinear loads, using simpower system
   and fuzzy tool box. The proposed topology performance is justified
   through exhaustive simulation under various loading conditions. The
   total harmonic distortion in source current (THDi) is being used as
   evaluation criteria to quantify the results. The THD; obtained by
   applying PI and AI based controller are compared and are well within the
   IEEE 519, 1992 std. limits. The proposed method is verified through
   experimentation by developing prototype with dSPACE 1103 interface. (C)

Abstract = {{Case-based reasoning (CBR) is one of the matured paradigms of artificial
   intelligence for problem solving. CBR has been applied in many areas in
   the commercial sector to assist daily operations. However, CBR is
   relatively new in the field of forensic science. Even though forensic
   personnel have consciously used past experiences in solving new cases,
   the idea of applying machine intelligence to support decision-making in
   forensics is still in its infancy and poses a great challenge. This
   paper highlights the limitation of the methods used in forensics
   compared with a CBR method in the analysis of forensic evidences. The
   design and development of an Intelligent Forensic Autopsy Report System
   (I-AuReSys) basing on a CBR method along with the experimental results
   are presented. Our system is able to extract features by using an
   information extraction (IE) technique from the existing autopsy reports;
   then the system analyzes the case similarities by coupling the CBR
   technique with a Naive Bayes learner for feature-weights learning; and
   finally it produces an outcome recommendation. Our experimental results
   reveal that the CBR method with the implementation of a learner is
   indeed a viable alternative method to the forensic methods with
   practical advantages. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A wide range of human reasoning patterns can be explained as
   conditioning in probabilistic models; however, conditioning has
   traditionally been viewed as an operation applied to such models, not
   represented in such models. We describe how probabilistic programs can
   explicitly represent conditioning as part of a model. This enables us to
   describe reasoning about others' reasoning using nested conditioning.
   Much of human reasoning is about the beliefs, desires, and intentions of
   other people; we use probabilistic programs to formalize these
   inferences in a way that captures the flexibility and inherent
   uncertainty of reasoning about other agents. We express examples from
   game theory, artificial intelligence, and linguistics as recursive
   probabilistic programs and illustrate how this representation language
   makes it easy to explore new directions in each of these fields. We
   discuss the algorithmic challenges posed by these kinds of models and
   describe how dynamic programming techniques can help address these
   challenges. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Prognostics and health management (PHM) play a key role in increasing
   the reliability and safety of systems especially in key sectors

   The imminence of the next degradation state in bearings is given by
   hidden Markov models, and the estimation of the remaining time before
   the next degradation state is given by the multistep time series
   prediction and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. A set of

Abstract = {{Current Manufacturing Systems challenges due to international economic
   crisis, market globalization and e-business trends, incites the
   development of intelligent systems to support decision making, which
   allows managers to concentrate on high-level tasks management while
   improving decision response and effectiveness towards manufacturing
   agility.
   This paper presents a novel negotiation mechanism for dynamic scheduling
   based on social and collective intelligence. Under the proposed
   negotiation mechanism, agents must interact and collaborate in order to
   improve the global schedule. Swarm Intelligence (SI) is considered a
   general aggregation term for several computational techniques, which use
   ideas and inspiration from the social behaviors of insects and other
   biological systems. This work is primarily concerned with negotiation,
   where multiple self-interested agents can reach agreement over the
   exchange of operations on competitive resources. Experimental analysis
   was performed in order to validate the influence of negotiation
   mechanism in the system performance and the SI technique. Empirical
   results and statistical evidence illustrate that the negotiation
   mechanism influence significantly the overall system performance and the
   effectiveness of Artificial Bee Colony for makespan minimization and on
   the machine occupation maximization. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Classification of hyperspectral imagery with neural networks: comparison
   to conventional tools}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Efficient exploitation of hyperspectral imagery is of great importance
   in remote sensing. Artificial intelligence approaches have been
   receiving favorable reviews for classification of hyperspectral data
   because the complexity of such data challenges the limitations of many
   conventional methods. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were shown to
   outperform traditional classifiers in many situations. However, studies
   that use the full spectral dimensionality of hyperspectral images to
   classify a large number of surface covers are scarce if non-existent. We
   advocate the need for methods that can handle the full dimensionality
   and a large number of classes to retain the discovery potential and the
   ability to discriminate classes with subtle spectral differences. We
   demonstrate that such a method exists in the family of ANNs. We compare
   the maximum likelihood, Mahalonobis distance, minimum distance, spectral
   angle mapper, and a hybrid ANN classifier for real hyperspectral AVIRIS
   data, using the full spectral resolution to map 23 cover types and using
   a small training set. Rigorous evaluation of the classification
   accuracies shows that the ANN outperforms the other methods and achieves
   a parts per thousand 90\% accuracy on test data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) to solve
   the multicast routing problem, which is abstracted as a Steiner tree
   problem in graphs. AFSA adopts a 0-1 encoding scheme to represent the
   artificial fish (AF), which are then subgraphs in the original graph.
   For evaluating each AF individual, we decode the subgraph into a Steiner
   tree. Based on the adopted representation of the AF, we design three AF
   behaviors: randomly moving, preying, and following. These behaviors are
   organized by a strategy that guides AF individuals to perform certain
   behaviors according to certain conditions and circumstances. In order to
   investigate the performance of our algorithm, we implement exhaustive
   simulation experiments. The results from the experiments indicate that
   the proposed algorithm outperforms other intelligence algorithms and can
   obtain the least-cost multicast routing tree in most cases.}},

Abstract = {{The interest in the utilization of offshore wind power is increasing
   significantly worldwide. A typical offshore wind farm may have hundreds
   of generators, which is outspread in the range of several to tens of
   kilometers. Therefore, there are many feasible schemes for the wind
   turbine location and internal line connection in a wind farm. The
   planner must search for an optimal one from these feasible schemes,
   usually with a maximum wind power output and the lowest installation and
   operation cost. This paper proposes a novel procedure to determine the
   optimization wind turbine location and line connection topology by using
   artificial intelligence techniques: The genetic algorithm is utilized in
   the optimal layouts for the offshore wind farm, and the ant colony
   system algorithm is utilized to find the optimal line connection
   topology. Furthermore, the wake effect, real cable parameters, and wind
   speed series are also considered in this research. The concepts and
   methods proposed in this study could help establish more economical and
   efficient offshore wind farms in the world.}},

Abstract = {{We present a chess visualization to convey the changes in a game over
   successive generations. It contains a score chart, an evolution graph
   and a chess board, such that users can understand a game from global to
   local viewpoints. Unlike current graphical chess tools, which focus only
   on highlighting pieces that are under attack and require sequential
   investigation, our visualization shows potential outcomes after a piece
   is moved and indicates how much tactical advantage the player can have
   over the opponent. Users can first glance at the score chart to roughly
   obtain the growth and decline of advantages from both sides, and then
   examine the position relations and the piece placements, to know how the
   pieces are controlled and how the strategy works. To achieve this
   visualization, we compute the decision tree using artificial
   intelligence to analyze a game, in which each node represents a chess
   position and each edge connects two positions that are one-move
   different. We then merge nodes representing the same chess position, and
   shorten branches where nodes on them contain only two neighbors, in
   order to achieve readability. During the graph rendering, the nodes
   containing events such as draws, effective checks and checkmates, are
   highlighted because they show how a game is ended. As a result, our
   visualization helps players understand a chess game so that they can
   efficiently learn strategies and tactics. The presented results,
   evaluations, and the conducted user studies demonstrate the feasibility
   of our visualization design.}},

Abstract = {{Serious games have recently shown great potential to be adopted in many
   applications, such as training and education. However, one critical
   challenge in developing serious games is the authoring of a large set of
   scenarios for different training objectives. In this paper, we propose a
   data-driven approach to automatically generate scenarios for serious
   games. Compared with other scenario generation methods, our approach
   leverages on the simulated player performance data to construct the
   scenario evaluation function for scenario generation. To collect the
   player performance data, an artificial intelligence (AI) player model is
   designed to imitate how a human player behaves when playing scenarios.
   The AI players are used to replace human players for data collection.
   The experiment results show that our data-driven approach provides good
   prediction accuracy on scenario's training intensities. It also
   outperforms our previous heuristic-based approach in its capability of
   generating scenarios that match closer to specified target player
   performance.Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{New communication technologies integrated into modern vehicles offer an
   opportunity for better assistance to people injured in traffic
   accidents. Recent studies show how communication capabilities should be
   supported by artificial intelligence systems capable of automating many
   of the decisions to be taken by emergency services, thereby adapting the
   rescue resources to the severity of the accident and reducing assistance
   time. To improve the overall rescue process, a fast and accurate
   estimation of the severity of the accident represent a key point to help
   emergency services better estimate the required resources. This paper
   proposes a novel intelligent system which is able to automatically
   detect road accidents, notify them through vehicular networks, and
   estimate their severity based on the concept of data mining and
   knowledge inference. Our system considers the most relevant variables
   that can characterize the severity of the accidents (variables such as
   the vehicle speed, the type of vehicles involved, the impact speed, and
   the status of the airbag). Results show that a complete Knowledge
   Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, with an adequate selection of
   relevant features, allows generating estimation models that can predict
   the severity of new accidents. We develop a prototype of our system
   based on off-the-shelf devices and validate it at the Applus+ IDIADA
   Automotive Research Corporation facilities, showing that our system can
   notably reduce the time needed to alert and deploy emergency services
   after an accident takes place.}},

   Factored State Spaces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ACM}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Many areas of computer science require answering questions about
   reachability in compactly described discrete transition systems.
   Answering such questions effectively requires techniques to be able to
   do so without building the entire system. In particular, heuristic
   search uses lower-bounding ({''}admissible{''}) heuristic functions to
   prune parts of the system known to not contain an optimal solution. A
   prominent technique for deriving such bounds is to consider abstract
   transition systems that aggregate groups of states into one. The key
   question is how to design and represent such abstractions. The most
   successful answer to this question are pattern databases, which
   aggregate states if and only if they agree on a subset of the state
   variables. Merge-and-shrink abstraction is a new paradigm that, as we
   show, allows to compactly represent a more general class of
   abstractions, strictly dominating pattern databases in theory We
   identify the maximal class of transition systems, which we call factored
   transition systems, to which merge-and-shrink applies naturally, and we
   show that the well-known notion of bisiruilarity can be adapted to this
   framework in a way that still guarantees perfect heuristic functions,
   while potentially reducing abstraction size exponentially. Applying
   these ideas to planning, one of the foundational subareas of artificial
   intelligence, we show that in some benchmarks this size reduction leads
   to the computation of perfect heuristic functions in polynomial time and
   that more approximate merge-and-shrink strategies yield heuristic
   functions competitive with the state of the art.}},

Abstract = {{The CASAM multimedia annotation system implements a model of cooperative
   annotation between a human annotator and automated components. The aim
   is that they work asynchronously but together. The system focuses upon
   the areas where automated recognition and reasoning are most effective
   and the user is able to work in the areas where their unique skills are
   required. The system's reasoning is influenced by the annotations
   provided by the user and, similarly, the user can see the system's work
   and modify and, implicitly, direct it. The CASAM system interacts with
   the user by providing a window onto the current state of annotation, and
   by generating requests for information which are important for the final
   annotation or to constrain its reasoning. The user can modify the
   annotation, respond to requests and also add their own annotations. The
   objective is that the human annotator's time is used more effectively
   and that the result is an annotation that is both of higher quality and
   produced more quickly. This can be especially important in circumstances
   where the annotator has a very restricted amount of time in which to
   annotate the document. In this paper we describe our prototype system.
   We expand upon the techniques used for automatically analysing the
   multimedia document, for reasoning over the annotations generated and
   for the generation of an effective interaction with the end-user. We
   also present the results of evaluations undertaken with media
   professionals in order to validate the approach and gain feedback to
   drive further research.}},

   regime of the induction motor and the significance of its accurate
   modelling are introduced. The application of SVM for the task is
   discussed, both as the standalone regression method and combined with
   the preceding classification approach (such as decision trees). Methods
   of measuring the regression accuracy in both scenarios are introduced.
   Experimental results of the model identification are presented in detail
   and discussed. The SVM optimization is performed, including selection of
   the kernel and its parameters' values, maximizing the diagnostic

Abstract = {{Massive open online courses, online tutoring systems, and other computer
   homework systems are rapidly changing engineering education by providing
   increased student feedback and capitalizing upon online systems'
   scalability. While online homework systems provide great benefits, a
   growing concern among engineering educators is that students are losing
   both the critical art of sketching and the ability to take a real system
   and reduce it to an accurate but simplified free-body diagram (FBD). For
   example, some online systems allow the drag and drop of forces onto
   FBDs, but they do not allow the user to sketch the FBDs, which is a
   vital part of the learning process. In this paper, we discuss Mechanix,
   a sketch recognition tool that provides an efficient means for
   engineering students to learn how to draw truss FBDs and solve truss
   problems. The system allows students to sketch FBDs into a tablet
   computer or by using a mouse and a standard computer monitor. Using
   artificial intelligence, Mechanix can determine not only the component
   shapes and features of the diagram but also the relationships between
   those shapes and features. Because Mechanix is domain specific, it can
   use those relationships to determine not only whether a student's work
   is correct but also why it is incorrect. Mechanix is then able to
   provide immediate, constructive feedback to students without providing
   final answers. Within this manuscript, we document the inner workings of
   Mechanix, including the artificial intelligence behind the scenes, and
   present studies of the effects on student learning. The evaluations have
   shown that Mechanix is as effective as paper-and-pencil-based homework
   for teaching method of joints truss analysis; focus groups with students
   who used the program have revealed that they believe Mechanix enhances
   their learning and that they are highly engaged while using it.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{ZigBee is the primary standard solution for wireless sensor networks,
   implementing the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol in the
   network layer and supported by the standard IEEE 802.15.4. This study is
   focused on mesh topologies and the critical problems encountered when
   AODV is executed in conjunction with the Carrier Sense Multiple Access
   with Collision Avoidance protocol. These problems are mainly related to
   the packet overhead required to carry out route creation. To perform
   preliminary experiments to be able to implement AODV in a real network,
   a new metric is proposed herein. This metric uses fuzzy logic to help in
   the decision-making process. The objective of the fuzzy routine is to
   determine, during the route-discovery process, the best node to forward
   request/reply packets, with the aim of reducing packet overhead and
   energy consumption. Moreover, minor changes are also added to the
   discovery procedure of AODV to improve the performance of the
   route-creation process. This intelligent version of AODV has provided
   promising experimental results, greatly reducing the number of packets
   required, with the consequent energy saving while selecting the best
   nodes to be part of the routes.}},

Volume = {{62}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Web services as independent software components are published by service
   providers over the Internet and invoked by service requesters for their
   desired functionalities. In many cases, however, there is no single
   service in a Web service repository satisfying a service request. So how
   to design an efficient method for composing a chain of connected
   services has become an important research issue. Recently, much research
   has been done into the search time reduction when finding a composite
   service. However, most methods take a long time for traversing all of
   the Web services in a service repository, thus it makes their response
   time significantly overrun a user's waiting patience. This paper
   develops an efficient approach for automatic composition of Web services
   using the state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) planners, where
   a Web service composition (WSC) problem is regarded as a WSC planning
   problem. Unlike most traditional WSC methods that traverse a Web service
   repository many times, our approach converts a Web service repository
   into a planning domain in PDDL just once, which will only be regenerated
   when the Web service repository changes. This treatment substantially
   reduces the response time and improves the scalability of solving WSC
   problems. We have implemented a prototype system and conducted extensive
   experiments on large-scale Web service repositories. The experimental
   results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the
   state-of-the-art. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pattern matching, if understood in a broad enough sense, includes a
   variety of operations, from simple pattern matching operations
   implemented in a number of programming languages to matching a frame
   pattern to a frame example, which underlies some knowledge
   representation systems in artificial intelligence. In this paper, a
   mathematical language is presented that is based on the concepts of
   category theory and allows one to formally describe various types of
   pattern matching from a unified point of view. A typical example of a
   pattern is given by an expression containing variables that can be
   substituted by other expressions. The category-theoretical description
   of such patterns presented in the paper is close to the Kleisli
   construction, which is often used for the formalization of a
   substitution of expressions for variables. However, the category
   presented in the paper is not the dual of the Kleisli category, and each
   pattern in it is assigned a morphism; this allows one to more clearly
   describe the idea of matching. In particular, the language proposed
   allows one to describe rules based on pattern matching. Such rules are
   often used in computer systems.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{The claim has often been made that passing the Turing Test would not be
   sufficient to prove that a computer program was intelligent because a
   trivial program could do it, namely, the ``Humongous-Table (HT)
   Program{''}, which simply looks up in a table what to say next. This
   claim is examined in detail. Three ground rules are argued for: (1) That
   the HT program must be exhaustive, and not be based on some vaguely
   imagined set of tricks. (2) That the HT program must not be created by
   some set of sentient beings enacting responses to all possible inputs.
   (3) That in the current state of cognitive science it must be an open
   possibility that a computational model of the human mind will be
   developed that accounts for at least its nonphenomenological properties.
   Given ground rule 3, the HT program could simply be an ``optimized{''}
   version of some computational model of a mind, created via the automatic
   application of program-transformation rules {[}thus satisfying ground
   rule 2]. Therefore, whatever mental states one would be willing to
   impute to an ordinary computational model of the human psyche one should
   be willing to grant to the optimized version as well. Hence no one could
   dismiss out of hand the possibility that the HT program was intelligent.
   This conclusion is important because the Humongous-Table Program
   Argument is the only argument ever marshalled against the sufficiency of
   the Turing Test, if we exclude arguments that cognitive science is
   simply not possible.}},

Abstract = {{Some have claimed that since machines lack emotional ``qualia{''}, or

   unpersuasive. I first discuss recent work on emotion (from cognitive
   science, neuroscience and philosophy) that suggests that emotion plays
   various roles in cognition. I then raise the following question: are
   phenomenal experiences of emotion an essential or necessary component of
   the performance of these cognitive abilities? I then sharpen the
   question by distinguishing between four possible positions one might
   take. I reject one of these four positions largely on empirical grounds.
   But the remaining three positions all suggest that even if emotional
   qualia play an important role in human cognition, emotional qualia are
   not essential to the performance of these cognitive abilities in
   principle, so, e.g., a machine that lacks emotional qualia might still
   be able to perform them.}},

Abstract = {{A mechatronic approach integrating both passive and active controllers
   is presented in this study to deal with unwanted noise and vibration
   produced in an automobile wiper system operation. Wiper system is a
   flexible structure with high order, nonlinear model that is considered
   as a multi objective control problem since there is a conflict between
   its functionality quality in wiping and generated unwanted noise and
   vibration. A passive control technique using multi body system (MBS)
   model and finite element analysis (FEA) is introduced to identify the
   potential of the effectiveness of the physical parameters of wiper blade
   to give appropriate range to reduce the unwanted noise and vibration in
   the system. While, the significant contribution of active controller is
   to deal with uncertainties exerted to system within wiper operation. In
   passive control stage, natural frequencies of a uniblade automobile
   wiper are determined using modal testing. Later, a 3-dimensional model
   of a wiper blade assembly is developed in multi body system design to
   investigate the good validation test and agreement of the physical
   behavior of the system in experiment with finite element analysis.
   Parametric modification via complex eigenvalue is adopted to predict
   instability of the wiper blade. In active control level, experimental
   data collected from the wiper system during its operation. A system
   identification model named nonlinear auto regressive exogenous Elman
   neural network (NARXENN) is developed for implying the active
   controller. A bi-level adaptive-fuzzy controller is brought in whose
   parameters are tuned simultaneously by a multi objective genetic
   algorithm (MOGA) to deal with the conflict interests in wiper control
   problem. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Grooming}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In wavelength division multiplexing optical networks, the vast majority
   of traffic demands present a bandwidth request in the range of Mbps
   which is much lower than the available bandwidth of an optical channel
   (Gbps). These low-speed traffic requests can be groomed or multiplexed
   onto one single channel with the aim of optimizing the resources and
   costs of the network topology. In the literature, this problem of
   grooming low-speed requests is known as the Traffic Grooming problem,
   and is considered as an optimization problem. In this work, we present a
   comparative study of nine multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for
   solving this NP-hard problem. Two of them are standard metaheuristics in
   the multiobjective domain: the Fast Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic
   Algorithm and the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm. The rest of
   them are multiobjective versions of well-known evolutionary algorithms:
   Differential Evolution, Variable Neighbourhood Search, Gravitational
   Search Algorithm, Artificial Bee Colony, Firefly Algorithm, Ant Colony
   Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization. In the comparative study,
   the approaches are compared when tackling four optical networks with a
   different number of nodes: 6, 11, 14, and 55 nodes. Furthermore, for
   each topology, we use different amounts of traffic: small, medium, and
   large. The results of this comparative study indicate that the
   multiobjective versions based on swarm intelligence obtain very good
   performance in almost all optical networks. Finally, we present a
   comparison between the best multiobjective approach and other methods
   published in the literature. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The noise bandwidth is an important parameter on the Global Positioning
   System (GPS) tracking loop; the larger the bandwidth the better the high
   dynamic performance, but the thermal noise suppression capability is
   reduced. In a GPS/Inertial Navigation System (INS) tightly integration
   system, the GPS receiver's carrier phase lock loops (PLLs) are aided by
   the Doppler shift from the INS, which can reduce user most dynamics. So
   the noise bandwidth can be narrowed to decrease the thermal noise
   tracking errors. However, due to the inertial sensor errors, the
   external INS-derived Doppler shift information are not completely
   accurate, therefore a Doppler-aiding error-induced phase error source
   must exist. The part of tracking error is derived in this paper. Other
   error sources are still present, so the bandwidth of PLLs cannot be set
   arbitrarily. This paper applies one artificial intelligence technique,
   the fuzzy logic controller (FLC), to calculate the PLL noise bandwidth
   on-line. Simulation results prove that the proposed FLC-based software
   receiver does achieve a superior tracking ability over conventional
   tracking loops in complicated conditions. In addition, the proposed
   algorithm works in the real-time mode and can be used in many practical
   applications.}},

Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{210}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Complex engineering systems require efficient on-line fault diagnosis
   methodologies to improve safety and reduce maintenance costs.
   Traditionally, diagnosis approaches are centralized, but these solutions
   do not scale well. Also, centralized diagnosis solutions are difficult
   to implement on increasingly prevalent distributed, networked embedded
   systems. This paper presents a distributed diagnosis framework for
   physical systems with continuous behavior. Using Possible Conflicts, a
   structural model decomposition method from the Artificial Intelligence
   model-based diagnosis (DX) community, we develop a distributed diagnoser
   design algorithm to build local event-based diagnosers. These diagnosers
   are constructed based on global diagnosability analysis of the system,
   enabling them to generate local diagnosis results that are globally
   correct without the use of a centralized coordinator. We also use
   Possible Conflicts to design local parameter estimators that are
   integrated with the local diagnosers to form a comprehensive distributed
   diagnosis framework. Hence, this is a fully distributed approach to
   fault detection, isolation, and identification. We evaluate the
   developed scheme on a four-wheeled rover for different design scenarios
   to show the advantages of using Possible Conflicts, and generate on-line
   diagnosis results in simulation to demonstrate the approach. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The ability of computational intelligence methods to predict epileptic
   seizures is evaluated in long-term EEG recordings of 278 patients
   suffering from pharmaco-resistant partial epilepsy, also known as
   refractory epilepsy. This extensive study in seizure prediction
   considers the 278 patients from the European Epilepsy Database,
   collected in three epilepsy centres: Hopital Pitie-la-Salpetriere,
   Paris, France; Universitatsklinikum Freiburg, Germany; Centro Hospitalar
   e Universitario de Coimbra, Portugal.
   For a considerable number of patients it was possible to find a patient
   specific predictor with an acceptable performance, as for example
   predictors that anticipate at least half of the seizures with a rate of
   false alarms of no more than 1 in 6 h (0.15 h(-1)). We observed that the
   epileptic focus localization, data sampling frequency, testing duration,
   number of seizures in testing, type of machine learning, and preictal
   time influence significantly the prediction performance.
   The results allow to face optimistically the feasibility of a patient
   specific prospective alarming system, based on machine learning
   techniques by considering the combination of several univariate
   (single-channel) electroencephalogram features. We envisage that this
   work will serve as benchmark data that will be of valuable importance
   for future studies based on the European Epilepsy Database. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Automatic emotion recognition from speech signals is one of the
   important research areas, which adds value to machine intelligence.
   Pitch, duration, energy and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)
   are the widely used features in the field of speech emotion recognition.
   A single classifier or a combination of classifiers is used to recognize
   emotions from the input features. The present work investigates the
   performance of the features of Autoregressive (AR) parameters, which
   include gain and reflection coefficients, in addition to the traditional
   linear prediction coefficients (LPC), to recognize emotions from speech
   signals. The classification performance of the features of AR parameters
   is studied using discriminant, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Gaussian
   mixture model (GMM), back propagation artificial neural network (ANN)
   and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and we find that the
   features of reflection coefficients recognize emotions better than the
   LPC. To improve the emotion recognition accuracy, we propose a
   class-specific multiple classifiers scheme, which is designed by
   multiple parallel classifiers, each of which is optimized to a class.
   Each classifier for an emotional class is built by a feature identified
   from a pool of features and a classifier identified from a pool of
   classifiers that optimize the recognition of the particular emotion. The
   outputs of the classifiers are combined by a decision level fusion
   technique. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme
   improves the emotion recognition accuracy. Further improvement in
   recognition accuracy is obtained when the scheme is built by including
   MFCC features in the pool of features. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Bridges are essential infrastructure of the transportation network.
   Therefore, maintenance tasks are mandatory to prevent these structures
   from degradation over time. In practice, funding availability for
   maintenance projects is often confined and this necessitates
   prioritization of different bridges that are in need of remedial
   activities. The writers aim to construct an artificial intelligence (AI)
   approach, evolutionary fuzzy least-squares support-vector machine
   (LSSVM) inference model (EFLSIM), for prioritizing bridges based on risk
   scores (RSs). In EFLSIM, fuzzy logic (FL) is utilized to enhance the
   capability of approximate reasoning and to deal with subjective
   information, which is obtained from human judgment. The inference model
   employs LSSVM as a supervised learning technique to infer the fuzzy
   input-output mapping relationship. Differential evolution (DE) is
   integrated into the model to optimize its tuning parameters.
   Experimental results and comparison illustrates that EFLSIM can
   successfully absorb and simulate human knowledge in the
   bridge-assessment process. Additionally, the newly built model has
   outperformed other benchmark approaches in terms of both reliability and
   accuracy. A 10-fold cross-validation process has demonstrated that the
   EFLSIM has achieved more than 38\% reduction in RMS error compared to
   other benchmark methods. Thus, the proposed AI approach is a promising
   tool to support decision-makers in bridge-maintenance planning. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper studies markets, such as Internet marketplaces for used cars
   or mortgages, in which consumers engage in sequential search. In
   particular, we consider the impact of information-brokers (experts) who
   can, for a fee, provide better information on true values of
   opportunities. We characterize the optimal search strategy given a price
   and the terms of service set by the expert, and show how to use this
   characterization to solve the monopolist expert's service pricing
   problem. Our analysis enables the investigation of three common pricing
   schemes (pay-per-use, unlimited subscription, and package pricing) that
   can be used by the expert. We demonstrate that in settings
   characteristic of electronic marketplaces, namely those with lower
   search costs for consumers and lower costs of production of expert
   services, unlimited subscription schemes are favored. Finally, we show
   that the platform that connects consumer and experts can improve social
   welfare by subsidizing the purchase of expert services. The optimal
   level of subsidy forces the buyer to exactly fully internalize the
   marginal cost of provision of expert services. In electronic markets,
   this cost is minimal, so it may be worthwhile for the platform to make
   the expert freely available to consumers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   To demonstrate the advantage gained by Chebyshev neural networks

Abstract = {{Steven Brams's {[}(1994). Theory of moves. Cambridge University Press]
   Theory of Moves (TOM) is an alternative to traditional game theoretic
   treatment of real-life interactions, in which players choose strategies
   based on analysis of future moves and counter-moves that arise if game
   play commences at a specified start state and either player can choose
   to move first. In repeated play, players using TOM rationality arrive at
   nonmyopic equilibria. One advantage of TOM is its ability to model
   scenarios in which power asymmetries exist between players. In
   particular, threat power, i.e. the ability of one player to threaten and
   sustain immediate, globally disadvantageous outcomes to force a
   desirable result long term, can be utilised to induce Pareto optimal
   states in games such as Prisoner's Dilemma which result in
   Pareto-dominated outcomes using traditional methods. Unfortunately,
   prior work on TOM is limited by an assumption of complete information.
   This paper presents a mechanism that can be used by a player to utilise
   threat power when playing a strict, ordinal 2x2 game under incomplete
   information. We also analyse the benefits of threat power and support in
   this analysis with empirical evidence.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation and quantitative analysis of urban land use change are
   effective ways to investigate urban form evolution. Cellular Automata
   (CA) has been used as a convenient and useful tool for simulating urban
   land use change. However, the key issue for CA models is the definition
   of the transition rules, and a number of statistical or artificial
   intelligence methods may be used to obtain the optimal rules.
   Neighborhood configuration is a basic component of transition rules, and
   is characterized by a distance decay effect. However, many CA models do
   not consider the neighbor decay effect in cellular space. This paper
   presents a neighbor decay cellular automata model based on particle
   swarm optimization (PSO-NDCA). We used particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   to find transition rules and considered the decay effect of the cellular
   neighborhood. A negative power exponential function was used to compute
   the decay coefficient of the cellular neighborhood in the model. By
   calculating the cumulative differences between simulation results and
   the sample data, the PSO automatically searched for the optimal
   combination of parameters of the transition rules. Using Xiamen City as
   a case study, we simulated urban land use changes for the periods
   1992-1997 and 2002-2007. Results showed that the PSO-NDCA model had a
   higher prediction accuracy for built-up land, and a higher overall
   accuracy and Kappa coefficient than the urban CA model based on particle
   swarm optimization. The study demonstrates that there exist optimal
   neighborhood decay coefficients in accordance with the regional
   characteristics of an area. Urban CA modelling should take into account
   the role of neighborhood decay.}},

Abstract = {{The prediction of propagation loss is a practical non-linear function
   approximation problem which linear regression or auto-regression models
   are limited in their ability to handle. However, some computational
   Intelligence techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and
   adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs) have been shown to have
   great ability to handle non-linear function approximation and prediction
   problems. In this study, the multiple layer perceptron neural network
   (MLP-NN), radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) and an ANFIS
   network were trained using actual signal strength measurement taken at
   certain suburban areas of Bauchi metropolis, Nigeria. The trained
   networks were then used to predict propagation losses at the stated
   areas under differing conditions. The predictions were compared with the
   prediction accuracy of the popular Hata model. It was observed that
   ANFIS model gave a better fit in all cases having higher R-2 values in
   each case and on average is more robust than MLP and RBF models as it
   generalises better to a different data.}},

Abstract = {{No-Search Approach is a component of Linguistic Geometry (LG), a type of
   game theory for extensive discrete games scalable to the level of real
   life defense systems. LG is a formal model of human reasoning about
   armed conflict, a mental reality ``hard-wired'' in the human brain. LG,
   an evolutionary product of millions of years of human warfare, must be a
   component of the Primary Language of the human brain (as introduced by
   J. Von Neumann). Experiences of development of LG must be instructive
   for solving another major puzzle, discovering the algorithm of
   discovery, yet another ancient component of the Primary Language. This
   paper reports results on discovering mental processes involved in the
   development of the major result in LG, the No-Search Approach. Those
   mental processes manifesting execution of the algorithm of discovery are
   called visual streams. It seems that those streams are the only
   interface of the algorithm of discovery. This paper demonstrates a
   typical situation in discoveries in mathematics and computer science
   when the original result (an idea) has been envisioned via one type of
   semi-formal visual streams and later proved via different streams that
   involve formal mathematical theories.}},

Title = {{Prediction of survival of ICU patients using computational intelligence}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{13-19}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a computational-intelligence-based model to predict
   the survival rate of critically ill patients who were admitted to an
   intensive care unit (ICU). The prediction input variables were based on
   the first 24 h admission physiological data of ICU patients to forecast
   whether the final outcome was survival or not. The prediction model was
   based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based Fuzzy
   Hyper-Rectangular Composite Neural Network (PFHRCNN) that integrates
   three computational intelligence tools including hyper-rectangular
   composite neural networks, fuzzy systems and PSO. It could help doctors
   to make appropriate treatment decisions without excessive laboratory
   tests. The performance of the proposed prediction model was evaluated on
   the data set collected from 300 ICU patients in the Cathy General
   Hospital in 2012. There were 10 input variables in total for the
   prediction model. Nine of these variables (e.g. systolic arterial blood
   pressures, systolic non-invasive blood pressures, respiratory rate,
   heart rate, and body temperature) were routinely available for 24 h in
   ICU and the last variable is patient's age. The proposed model could
   achieve a 96\% and 86\% accuracy rate for the training data and testing
   data, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Computer-assisted chemical structure elucidation has been intensively
   studied since the first use of computers in chemistry in the 1960s. Most
   of the existing elucidators use a structure-spectrum database to obtain
   clues about the correct structure. Such a structure-spectrum database is
   expected to grow on a daily basis. Hence, the necessity to develop an
   efficient structure elucidation system that can adapt to the growth of a
   database has been also growing. Therefore, we have developed a new
   elucidator using practically efficient graph algorithms, including the
   convex bipartite matching, weighted bipartite matching, and
   Bron-Kerbosch maximal clique algorithms. The utilization of the two
   matching algorithms especially is a novel point of our elucidator.
   Because of these sophisticated algorithms, the elucidator exactly
   produces a correct structure if all of the fragments are included in the
   database. Even if not all of the fragments are in the database, the
   elucidator proposes relevant substructures that can help chemists to
   identify the actual chemical structures. The elucidator, called the
   CAST/CNMR Structure Elucidator, plays a complementary role to the
   CAST/CNMR Chemical Shift Predictor, and together these two functions can
   be used to analyze the structures of organic compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Games have always been a popular test bed for artificial intelligence
   techniques. Game developers are always in constant search for techniques

   evolutionary process towards games, which are entertaining, we propose a
   set of metrics. These metrics are based upon different theories of
   entertainment in computer games. This work also compares the
   entertainment value of the evolved games with the existing popular board
   based games. Further to verify the entertainment value of the evolved
   games with the entertainment value of the human user a human user survey
   is conducted. In addition to the user survey we check the learnability
   of the evolved games using an artificial neural network based
   controller. The proposed metrics and the evolutionary process can be
   employed for generating new and entertaining board games, provided an
   initial search space is given to the evolutionary algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{A key challenge of adaptive interactive systems is to provide a positive
   user experience by extracting implicitly the users' unique
   characteristics through their interactions with the system, and
   dynamically adapting and personalizing the system's content presentation

   styles of users as determinant factors for personalization. The
   overarching goal of this paper is to increase our understanding about
   the effect of cognitive styles of users on their navigation behavior and
   content representation preference. We propose a Web-based tool,
   utilizing Artificial Intelligence techniques, to implicitly capture and
   find any possible relations between the cognitive styles of users and
   their characteristics in navigation behavior and content representation
   preference by using their Web interaction data. The proposed tool has
   been evaluated with a user study revealing that cognitive styles of
   users have an effect on their navigation behavior and content

Title = {{Automated planning to minimise uncertainty of machine tool calibration}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{63-72}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{When calibrating a machine tool, multiple measurement tasks will be
   performed, each of which has an associated uncertainty of measurement.
   International Standards and best-practice guides are available to aid
   with estimating uncertainty of measurement for individual tasks, but
   there is little consideration for the temporal influence on the
   uncertainty when considering interrelated measurements. Additionally,
   there is an absence of any intelligent method capable of optimising
   (reducing) the estimated uncertainty of the calibration plan as a whole.
   In this work, the uncertainty of measurement reduction problem is
   described and modelled in a suitable language to allow state-of-the-art
   artificial intelligence planning tools to produce optimal calibration
   plans. The paper describes how the continuous, non-linear temperature
   aspects are discretized and modelled to make them easier for the planner
   to solve. In addition, detail is provided as how the complex uncertainty
   equations are modelled in a restrictive language where its syntax
   heavily influences the encoding. An example is shown for a three-axis
   machine, where the produced plan exhibits intelligent behaviour in terms
   of scheduling measurements against temperature deviation and the
   propagation of error uncertainties. In this example, a reduction of 58\%
   in the estimated uncertainty of measurement due to intelligently
   scheduling a calibration plan is observed. This reduction in the
   estimated uncertainty of measurement will result in an increased
   conformance zone, thus reducing false acceptance and rejection of
   work-pieces. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Research into the use of diagrams is an interdisciplinary endeavour,
   encompassing disciplines as diverse as psychology, architecture and
   artificial intelligence. It is also a relatively new research area, with
   the first meeting of like-minded researchers interested in studying
   diagrams taking place in 1997. Now that diagrams research is more
   established, it is timely to review its scope, nature and progress. This
   paper reviews diagrams research over the past twelve years, as
   represented in the proceedings of the International Conference on the
   Theory and Application of Diagrams. In summarising the contents of these
   proceedings, a taxonomy describing the scope of diagrams research is
   proposed, the several research issues covered are identified, and the
   extent to which layout and aesthetics form part of this body of research
   is discussed. In concluding, trends and under-represented areas are
   noted and discussed. The aim of the paper is not only to summarise the
   research covered in this particular conference, but to provide a basis
   for on-going discussion on the changing nature of diagrams research. (C)

Abstract = {{Organisms modify their behavior in response to its consequences, a
   phenomenon referred to as operant learning. The computational principles
   and neural mechanisms underlying operant learning are a subject of
   extensive experimental and theoretical investigations. Theoretical
   approaches largely rely on concepts and algorithms from reinforcement
   learning. The dominant view is that organisms maintain a value function,
   that is, a set of estimates of the cumulative future rewards associated
   with the different behavioral options. These values are then used to
   select actions. Learning in this framework results from the update of
   these values depending on experience of the consequences of past
   actions. An alternative view questions the applicability of such a
   computational scheme to many real-life situations. Instead, it posits
   that organisms exploit the intrinsic variability in their
   action-selection mechanism(s) to modify their behavior, e.g., via
   stochastic gradient ascent, without the need of an explicit
   representation of values. In this review, we compare these two
   approaches in terms of their computational power and flexibility, their
   putative neural correlates, and, finally, in terms of their ability to
   account for behavior as observed in repeated-choice experiments. We
   discuss the successes and failures of these alternative approaches in
   explaining the observed patterns of choice behavior. We conclude by
   identifying some of the important challenges to a comprehensive theory
   of operant learning.}},

Abstract = {{The most pressing question about cognitive brains is how they support
   the compositionality that enables combinatorial manipulations of images,
   thoughts, and actions. When addressing this problem with synthetic
   modeling, the conventional idea prevalent in artificial intelligence and
   cognitive science, generally, is to assume hybrid systems and
   corresponding neural network models, where higher order cognition is
   realized by means of symbolic representation and lower sensory-motor
   processes by analog processing. However, the crucial problem with such
   approaches is that the symbols represented at higher order cognitive
   levels cannot be grounded naturally in sensory-motor reality. The former
   are defined in a discrete space without any metric, and the latter are
   defined in a continuous space with a physical metric. These, therefore,
   cannot directly interact with each other, regardless of the interface
   that is assigned between them. The proposal in the current paper is to
   reconstruct higher order cognition by means of continuous neurodynamic
   systems that can elaborate delicate interactions with the sensory-motor
   level while sharing the same metric space. Our neurorobotics
   experiments-including language-action associations and the learning of
   goal-directed actions-show that the compositionality necessary for
   higher order cognitive tasks can be acquired by means of self-organizing
   dynamic structures, via interactive learning between the top-down
   intentional process of acting on the physical world and the bottom-up
   recognition of perceptual reality. Using robotic simulations, the
   current paper demonstrates that nonlinear dynamic phenomena, such as
   bifurcations and the chaotic dynamics induced by unstable fixed points,
   could play essential roles in realizing higher order functions.}},

Abstract = {{Qualitative modelling is a technique integrating the fields of
   theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence and the physical
   and biological sciences. The aim is to be able to model the behaviour of
   systems without estimating parameter values and fixing the exact
   quantitative dynamics. Traditional applications are the study of the
   dynamics of physical and biological systems at a higher level of
   abstraction than that obtained by estimation of numerical parameter
   values for a fixed quantitative model. Qualitative modelling has been
   studied and implemented to varying degrees of sophistication in Petri
   nets, process calculi and constraint programming. In this paper we
   reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of existing frameworks, we
   demonstrate how recent advances in constraint programming can be
   leveraged to produce high quality qualitative models, and we describe
   the advances in theory and technology that would be needed to make
   constraint programming the best option for scientific investigation in
   the broadest sense.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term forecasting of wind speed has become a research hot spot in
   many different areas such as restructured electricity markets, energy
   management, and wind farm optimal design. However, wind energy with
   unstable and intermittent characteristics entails establishing accurate
   predicted data to avoid inefficient and less reliable results. The
   proposed study in this paper may provide a solution regarding the
   long-term wind speed forecast in order to solve the earlier-mentioned
   problems. For this purpose, two fundamentally different approaches, the
   statistical and the neural network-based approaches, have been developed
   to predict hourly wind speed data of the subsequent year. The novelty of
   this study is to forecast the general trend of the incoming year by
   designing a data fusion algorithm through several neural networks. A set
   of recent wind speed measurement samples from two meteorological
   stations in Malaysia, namely Kuala Terengganu and Mersing, are used to
   train and test the data set. The result obtained by the proposed method
   has given rather promising results in view of the very small mean
   absolute error (MAE).}},

Abstract = {{This paper elaborates on the novel intelligence assessment method using
   the brainwave sub-band power ratio features. The study focuses only on
   the left hemisphere brainwave in its relaxed state. Distinct
   intelligence quotient groups have been established earlier from the
   score of the Raven Progressive Matrices. Sub-band power ratios are
   calculated from energy spectral density of theta, alpha and beta
   frequency bands. Synthetic data have been generated to increase dataset
   from 50 to 120. The features are used as input to the artificial neural
   network. Subsequently, the brain behaviour model has been developed
   using an artificial neural network that is trained with optimized
   learning rate, momentum constant and hidden nodes. Findings indicate
   that the distinct intelligence quotient groups can be classified from
   the brainwave sub-band power ratios with 100\% training and 88.89\%
   testing accuracies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The biological domain holds interesting keys to the theorists who
   investigate the root causes of software maintenance. Several authors
   believe that software systems need to adapt to changing environment, the
   way the biological systems do. The objections raised against this
   generic comparison induced the author to attend additional lessons in
   biology. Living beings exploit three main forms of adaptation:
   intelligent, specialist, and genetic (or Darwinian). Of these,
   intelligent adaptation appears to be the most appropriate form to be
   examined in relation to computational phenomena; besides, it fits with
   the fundamental ideas of artificial intelligence. This study shows how
   computers are adaptive devices, which aid general systems (companies,
   production lines, individuals, etc.) to have successful behavior in the
   world. This assumption leads to the inference that the root causes of
   software evolution and those of the software itself coincide. Finally,
   all the factors that affect software maintenance have been surveyed and
   a measure to handle the software maintenance processes suggested.}},

Abstract = {{A good model of object shape is essential in applications such as
   segmentation, detection, inpainting and graphics. For example, when
   performing segmentation, local constraints on the shapes can help where
   object boundaries are noisy or unclear, and global constraints can
   resolve ambiguities where background clutter looks similar to parts of
   the objects. In general, the stronger the model of shape, the more
   performance is improved. In this paper, we use a type of deep Boltzmann
   machine (Salakhutdinov and Hinton, International Conference on
   Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 2009) that we call a Shape
   Boltzmann Machine (SBM) for the task of modeling foreground/background
   (binary) and parts-based (categorical) shape images. We show that the
   SBM characterizes a strong model of shape, in that samples from the
   model look realistic and it can generalize to generate samples that
   differ from training examples. We find that the SBM learns distributions
   that are qualitatively and quantitatively better than existing models
   for this task.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of vertical stress transmission in real soil profile using
   adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is documented in this
   investigation. A soil bin facility holding a single-wheel tester was
   utilized to arrange controlled condition for exploration of the effects
   of wheel load, forward velocity, slippage and depth each at three
   different levels. A profile housing seven load cells was buried at
   different depths when data were transmitted to a data acquisitioning
   system for derivation of 81 data points and then to build ANFIS-based
   model. The Sugeno-type fuzzy rules were constituted with various
   membership functions in the representations. In the Sugeno-type fuzzy
   inference approach, the modal was developed according to the four input
   parameters. Performance evaluation criteria (i.e. MSE, MRE and R-2) were
   incorporated in the study to find the highest quality solution. It was
   deduced, on the basis of performance criteria, that a Guassian
   membership function outperformed other tested membership functions. The
   results could serve as a catalyst to expedite the investigations in the
   realm of artificial intelligence application in prediction of soil
   stress transmission created by wheeled vehicle trafficking. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We introduce two new natural decision problems, denoted as there exists
   RATIONAL NASH and there exists IRRATIONAL NASH, pertinent to the
   rationality and irrationality, respectively, of Nash equilibria for
   (finite) strategic games. These problems ask, given a strategic game,
   whether or not it admits (i) a rational Nash equilibrium where all
   probabilities are rational numbers, and (ii) an irrational Nash
   equilibrium where at least one probability is irrational, respectively.
   We are interested here in the complexities of there exists RATIONAL NASH
   and there exists IRRATIONAL NASH.
   Towards this end, we study two other decision problems, denoted as
   NASH-EQUIVALENCE and NASH-REDUCTION, pertinent to some mutual properties
   of the sets of Nash equilibria of two given strategic games with the
   same number of players. The problem NASH-EQUIVALENCE asks whether or not
   the two sets of Nash equilibria coincide; we identify a restriction of
   its complementary problem that witnesses there exists RATIONAL NASH. The
   problem NASH-REDUCTION asks whether or not there is a so called Nash
   reduction: a suitable map between corresponding strategy sets of players
   that yields a Nash equilibrium of the former game from a Nash
   equilibrium of the latter game; we identify a restriction of
   NASH-REDUCTION that witnesses there exists IRRATIONAL NASH.
   As our main result, we provide two distinct reductions to simultaneously
   show that (i) NASH-EQUIVALENCE is co-NP-hard and there exists RATIONAL
   NASH is NP-hard, and (ii) NASH-REDUCTION and there exists IRRATIONAL
   NASH are both NP-hard, respectively. The reductions significantly extend
   techniques previously employed by Conitzer and Sandholm (Proceedings of
   the 18th Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 765-771, 2003;
   Games Econ. Behav. 63(2), 621-641, 2008).}},

Title = {{A knowledge-based architecture for the management of patient-focused
   care pathways}},
Journal = {{APPLIED INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{There is need for software systems in order to coordinate the activities
   of healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of a patient,
   aligning the care delivery around already existing Clinical Practice
   Guidelines (CPGs). This is being carried out in care organizations by
   implementing integrated Care Pathways (CPs). Nonetheless, the generation
   of these care pathways is not trivial, and multiple barriers exist for
   their development and enactment. In this paper, a knowledge-based
   architecture is presented that, by means of Knowledge Engineering
   methods and Artificial Intelligence Planning and Scheduling (AI P\&S)
   techniques, is able to automatically generate these care pathways from a
   computer-interpretable representation of CPGs, tackling some of these
   barriers. Firstly, these techniques consider the patient profile, the
   care organization details as well as the temporal and resource
   constraints, implicit in a care process, in order to generate a
   patient-focused care pathway. Moreover, they also allow the enactment of
   personalized care plans in a web-based format, powered by a workflow
   runtime engine, thus providing an ubiquitous and interactive execution
   to healthcare professionals. Finally, the architecture also includes
   monitoring and replanning techniques in order to check the current
   health status of patients and adapt care plans when they do not progress
   as expected. For the experimental evaluation of the architecture,
   several tests have been carried out in order to simulate a clinical
   environment where different care plans were automatically executed,
   monitored and adapted regarding the health conditions of patients as
   well as the recommendations specified in a real, CPG of the paediatric
   oncology area. As conclusion, the proposed architecture seems to be an
   adequate infrastructure for supporting the automated generation as well
   as the interactive execution and monitoring of patient-focused care
   pathways.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an electromagnetic optimization technique that
   blending full-wave method, artificial neural network, and
   population-based search algorithms for optimal design of frequency
   selective surfaces (FSSs) with fractal motifs. We consider a simple
   application of this technique in a single-layer FSS with Sierpinski
   island fractal patch elements. The optimization technique replaces the
   computational intensive full-wave method of moments simulations by a
   fast and accurate multilayer perceptrons neural network model of FSS
   spatial filter, which is used to compute the cost (or fitness) function
   in the search algorithms iterations. In the FSS optimization with
   specific resonant frequency and bandwidth, we use: bees algorithm,
   continuous genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization. A FSS
   prototype is built and measured for a first level of Sierpinski island
   fractal. The accuracy of the proposed optimization technique is verified
   through the excellent agreement (0.9\%) obtained by means of comparisons
   between theoretical and experimental results. (c) 2014 Wiley

Journal = {{BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{70-81}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The Data Rate Theorem that establishes a formal linkage between linear
   control theory and information theory carries deep implications for the
   design of biologically inspired cognitive architectures (BICAs), and for
   the more general study of embodied cognition. For example, modest
   extensions of the theorem provide a spectrum of necessary conditions
   dynamic statistical models that will be useful in empirical studies. A
   large deviations argument, however, suggests that the stabilization of
   such systems is itself an interpenetrating dynamic process necessarily
   convoluted with embodied cognition. As our experience with mental
   disorders and chronic disease implies, evolutionary process has had only
   modest success in the regulation and control of cognitive biological
   phenomena. For humans, the central role of culture has long been known.
   Although a ground-state collapse analogous to generalized anxiety
   appears particularly characteristic of such systems, lack of cultural
   modulation for real-time automatons or distributed cognition man-machine
   `cockpits' makes them particularly subject to a canonical pathology
   under which `all possible targets are enemies'. Concerted attention to
   cognitive theories of `mental dysfunction' across human, man-machine
   cockpit, and fully-machine modalities is needed, particularly in view of
   a successful BICA effort that would make highly complex automata that
   interact with humans ubiquitous. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The ever evolving telecommunication networks in terms of their
   technology, infrastructure, and supported services have always posed
   challenges to the network managers to come up with an efficient Network
   Management System (NMS) for effective network management. The need for
   automated and efficient management of the current networks, more
   specifically the Next Generation Network (NGN), is the subject addressed
   in this research. A detailed description of the management challenges in
   the context of current networks is presented and then this work enlists
   the desired features and characteristics of an efficient NMS. It then
   proposes that there is a need to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
   Machine Learning (ML) approaches for enhancing and automating the
   functions of NMS. The first contribution of this work is a comprehensive
   survey of the AI and ML approaches applied to the domain of NM. The
   second contribution of this work is that it presents the reasoning and
   evidence to support the choice of Bayesian Networks (BN) as a viable
   solution for ML-based NMS. The final contribution of this work is that
   it proposes and implements three novel NM solutions based on the BN
   approach, namely BN-based Admission Control (BNAC), BN-based Distributed
   Admission Control (BNDAC) and BN-based Intelligent Traffic Engineering
   (BNITE), along with the description of algorithms underpinning the

Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{115-136}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies the weighted earliness tardiness parallel machine
   problem where jobs have different processing times and distinct due
   dates. This NP hard problem arises in most just-in-time production
   environments. It is herein modeled as a mixed integer program, and
   solved using MASH, a deterministic heuristic based on multi-agent
   systems. MASH has three types of agents: I, G, and M. The I-agents are
   free jobs that need to be scheduled, whereas the G-agents are groups of
   jobs already assigned to machines. The M-agent acts as the system's
   manager of the independent intelligent I- and G-agents, which are driven
   by their own goals, fitness assessments, and context-dependent decision
   rules. The I- and G-agents employ exact and approximate approaches as
   part of their decisional process while the M-agent uses local search
   mechanisms to improve their (partial) solutions. The design of MASH is
   innovative in the way its intelligent agents determine bottleneck
   clusters and resolve conflicts for time slots. The numerical results
   provide computational evidence of the efficiency of MASH, whose
   performance on benchmark instances from the literature is superior to
   that of existing approaches. The success of MASH and its modularity make
   it a viable alternative to more complex manufacturing problems. Most
   importantly, they demonstrate the benefits of the hybridization of
   artificial intelligence and operations research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Many fields in applied sciences, like Artificial Intelligence and
   Computer Science, use aggregation methods to provide new generalized
   metrics from a collection of old ones. Thus, the problem of merging by
   means of a function a collection of generalized metrics into a single
   one has been recently studied in depth. Moreover, the mipoint sets for a
   generalized metric involving fuzzy sets have shown a great potential in
   medical diagnosis and decision making since it models the concept of
   compromise or middle way between two positions. Joining these facts, the
   aim of this paper is to provide a general framework for the study of
   midpoint sets for quasimetrics via aggregation theory. In particular, we
   determine the properties that an aggregation function must satisfy to
   characterize the midpoint set for a quasimetric generated by means of
   the fusion of a collection of quasimetrics in terms of the midpoint sets
   for each of the quasimetrics that are merged. In fact, this study
   generalizes the results for metrics in this context that are retrieved
   as a particular case of the exposed theory. Finally, some particular
   results for generalized metrics defined for fuzzy sets are proved. (C)

Title = {{Reinforcement learning-based design of sampling policies under cost
   constraints in Markov random fields: Application to weed map
   reconstruction}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS \& DATA ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Weeds are responsible for yield losses in arable fields, whereas the
   role of weeds in agro-ecosystem food webs and in providing ecological
   services has been well established. Innovative weed management policies
   have to be designed to handle this trade-off between production and
   regulation services. As a consequence, there has been a growing interest
   in the study of the spatial distribution of weeds in crops, as a
   prerequisite to management. Such studies are usually based on maps of
   weed species. The issues involved in building probabilistic models of
   spatial processes as well as plausible maps of the process on the basis
   of models and observed data are frequently encountered and important. As
   important is the question of designing optimal sampling policies that
   make it possible to build maps of high probability when the model is
   known. This optimization problem is more complex to solve than the pure
   reconstruction problem and cannot generally be solved exactly. A generic
   approach to spatial sampling for optimizing map construction, based on
   Markov Random Fields (MRF), is provided and applied to the problem of
   weed sampling for mapping. MRF offer a powerful representation for
   reasoning on large sets of random variables in interaction. In the field
   of spatial statistics, the design of sampling policies has been largely
   studied in the case of continuous variables, using tools from the
   geostatistics domain. In the MRF case with finite state space variables,
   some heuristics have been proposed for the design problem but no
   universally accepted solution exists, particularly when considering
   adaptive policies as opposed to static ones. The problem of designing an
   adaptive sampling policy in an MRF can be formalized as an optimization
   problem. By combining tools from the fields of Artificial Intelligence
   (AI) and Computational Statistics, an original algorithm is then
   proposed for approximate resolution. This generic procedure, referred to
   as Least-Squares Dynamic Programming (LSDP), combines an approximation
   of the value of a sampling policy based on a linear regression, the
   construction of a batch of MRF realizations and a backwards induction
   algorithm. Based on an empirical comparison of the performance of LSDP
   with existing one-step-look-ahead sampling heuristics and solutions
   provided by classical AI algorithms, the following conclusions can be
   derived; (i) a naive heuristic consisting of sampling sites where
   marginals are the most uncertain is already an efficient sampling
   approach; (ii) LSDP outperforms all the classical approaches we have
   tested; and (iii) LSDP outperforms the naive heuristic approach in cases
   where sampling costs are not uniform over the set of variables or where
   sampling actions are constrained. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{28-46}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{In this paper a new stochastic technique for solving the nonlinear
   Jeffery-Hamel flow equations is presented, taking into consideration the
   magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) effects. A feed-forward artificial neural
   network (ANN) trained with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the
   active-set method (ASM) is used for solving the problem. We first
   transform the original two-dimensional MHD Jeffery-Hamel problem into an
   equivalent third order boundary value problem (BVP). A mathematical
   model of the BVP is developed using a neural network formulation in an
   unsupervised manner. Optimal weights of the networks are learned with
   the PSO algorithm first, which is used as a tool for global search; the
   active-set method is employed for rapid local convergence in the second
   step. The designed scheme is evaluated on different cases of the problem
   by varying the angles of the walls, and the Reynolds and Hartmann
   numbers. Accuracy, convergence and effectiveness of the approach is
   established through extensive analyses based on a large number of
   independent runs. Comparative studies are carried out with numerical
   results of fully explicit Runge-Kutta method, as well as recently
   reported analytic solvers including variants of Adomian decomposition,
   Homotopy Perturbation, differential transform, Homotopy analysis and
   variational iteration methods to validate the correctness of the
   proposed scheme. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{3D virtual humans and physical human-like robots can be used to interact
   with people in a remote location in order to increase the feeling of
   presence. In a telepresence setup, their behaviors are driven by real
   participants. We envision that in the absence of the real users, when
   they have to leave or they do not want to do a repetitive task, the
   control of the robots can be handed to an artificial intelligence
   component to-sustain the ongoing. interaction. At the point when
   human-mediated interaction is required again, control can be returned to
   the real users. One of the main challenges in telepresence research is
   the adaptation of 3D position and orientation of the remote participants
   to the actual physical environment to have appropriate eye contact and
   gesture awareness in a group conversation. In case the human behind the
   robot and/or virtual human leaves, multi-party interaction should be
   handed to an artificial intelligence component. In this paper, we
   discuss the challenges in autonomous multi-party interaction among

Abstract = {{Future radiology practices assume that the radiology reports should be
   uniform, comprehensive, and easily managed. This means that reports must
   be readable to humans and machines alike. In order to improve reporting
   practices in breast imaging, we allow the radiologist to write
   structured reports with a special pen on paper with an invisible dot
   pattern. In this way, we provide a knowledge-acquisition system for
   printed mammography patient forms for the combined work with printed and
   digital documents. In this domain, printed documents cannot be easily
   replaced by computer systems because they contain free-form sketches and
   textual annotations, and the acceptance of traditional PC reporting
   tools is rather low among the doctors. This is due to the fact that
   current electronic reporting systems significantly add to the amount of
   time it takes to complete the reports. We describe our real-time digital
   paper application and focus on the use case study of our deployed
   application. We think that our results motivate the design and
   implementation of intuitive pen-based user interfaces for the medical
   reporting process and similar knowledge work domains. Our system imposes
   only minimal overhead on traditional form-filling processes and provides
   for a direct, ontology-based structuring of the user input for semantic
   search and retrieval applications, as well as other applied artificial
   intelligence scenarios, which involve manual form-based data

Abstract = {{For any construction project to succeed, it is very important to select
   the materials accurately during the project's initial stage. Trying to
   choose the best-performing materials is a crucial task for the
   successful completion of a construction project. The material selection
   process typically is performed through the information received from a
   highly experienced decision maker and a purchasing agent without the
   logical decision making; thus, the construction field gains access to
   various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to support decision
   models in their own selection method. Through a case study, this paper
   proposes the application of a systematic and efficient support vector
   machine (SVM) model to select suitable materials. The 120 data sets of
   the case study have completed building projects in South Korea. These
   data set were divided into three groups and constructed five binary
   classification models in the one-against-all (OAA) multiclassification
   method by data classification and normalization, resulting in the SVM
   model, based on the kernel polynominal, yielding a prediction accuracy
   rate of 87.5\%. This case study indicates that the SVM model appears

Abstract = {{Owing to the rapid growth in the use of wind power, there is a need to
   carry out an evaluation of the frequency and voltage control of this
   technology. This study focuses on the voltage control of the evacuation
   network which connects different wind farms to the transmission network

   algorithm which can be used as an alternative to classical techniques
   such as optimal power flow or artificial intelligence to determine the
   amount of reactive power that each wind farm should supply in order to
   minimise the power losses of a whole evacuation network. The optimal
   voltage control proposed in this study uses data mining techniques
   (regression rules to estimate the optimum reactive power of the wind
   farms and classification trees to estimate the optimum transformer
   taps). The methodology proposed in this study is illustrated with a
   study of two actual evacuation networks in the Spanish power system. The
   first one is representative of long feeders whereas the second one is
   representative of short feeders. The variability in the results of the
   methodology seems to be dependent on the features of the grids.}},

Title = {{Training for crisis decision making - An approach based on plan

Abstract = {{The human ability to take the right decisions is very important in real
   world critical situations. An interesting problem always worth being
   investigated concerns how to teach decision making skills to humans. The
   real nature of taking decisions is extremely difficult to describe in
   detail and, as a consequence, training it according to fixed protocols
   is also challenging. This is because it comes out as a combination of
   natural talent, competence from previous experience, ability to quick
   reasoning, leadership, resilience to stress, and so on. We have
   addressed this problem while building a new learning environment to
   train crisis decision makers.
   The environment, called PANDORA, is grounded on Artificial Intelligence
   planning techniques known as ``timeline-based{''}. This technology is
   used to create and manipulate segments of lesson's content over time.
   Planning a lesson corresponds to logically organize events over time
   that are then rendered in front of trainees during the lesson's actual
   enactment. This paper shows how the machinery of continuous plan
   adaptation is functional to create variety and novelty in the lessons
   thus engaging the trainees during the teaching interaction. In
   particular, it shows the different uses of plan adaptation to take into
   account the basic reactivity of the trainees, the background deductions
   from user modeling, and the mixed-initiative interactions guided by the
   trainer. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Computing systems and networks become increasingly large and complex
   with a variety of compromises and vulnerabilities. The network security
   and privacy are of great concern today, where self-defense against
   different kinds of attacks in an autonomous and holistic manner is a
   challenging topic. To address this problem, we developed an innovative
   technology called Bionic Autonomic Nervous System (BANS). The BANS is
   analogous to biological nervous system, which consists of basic modules
   like cyber axon, cyber neuron, peripheral nerve and central nerve. We
   also presented an innovative self-defense mechanism which utilizes the
   Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Entropy Awareness, etc. Equipped with
   the BANS, computer and network systems can intelligently self-defend
   against both known and unknown compromises/attacks including denial of
   services (DoS), spyware, malware, and virus. BANS also enabled multiple
   computers to collaboratively fight against some distributed intelligent
   attacks like DDoS. We have implemented the BANS in practice. Some case
   studies and experimental results exhibited the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the BANS and the self-defense mechanism.}},

Title = {{Fast fashion sales forecasting with limited data and time}},
Journal = {{DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{84-92}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Fast fashion is a commonly adopted strategy in fashion retailing. Under
   fast fashion, operational decisions have to be made with a tight
   schedule and the corresponding forecasting method has to be completed
   with very limited data within a limited time duration. Motivated by fast
   fashion business practices, in this paper, an intelligent forecasting
   algorithm, which combines tools such as the extreme learning machine and
   the grey model, is developed. Our real data analysis demonstrates that
   this newly derived algorithm can generate reasonably good forecasting
   under the given time and data constraints. Further analysis with an
   artificial dataset shows that the proposed algorithm performs especially
   well when either (i) the demand trend slope is large, or (ii) the
   seasonal cycle's variance is large. These two features fit the fast
   fashion demand pattern very well because the trend factor is significant
   and the seasonal cycle is usually highly variable in fast fashion. The
   results from this paper lay the foundation which can help to achieve
   real time sales forecasting for fast fashion operations in the future.
   Some managerial implications are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Time provides context for all our experiences, cognition, and
   coordinated collective action. Prior research in linguistics, artificial
   intelligence, and temporal databases suggests the need to differentiate
   between temporal facts with goal-related semantics (i.e., telic) from
   those are intrinsically devoid of culmination (i.e., atelic). To
   differentiate between telic and atelic data semantics in conceptual
   database design, we propose an annotation-based temporal conceptual
   model that generalizes the semantics of a conventional conceptual model.
   Our temporal conceptual design approach involves: 1) capturing
   ``what{''} semantics using a conventional conceptual model; 2) employing
   annotations to differentiate between telic and atelic data semantics
   that help capture ``when{''} semantics; 3) specifying temporal
   constraints, specifically nonsequenced semantics, in the temporal data
   dictionary as metadata. Our proposed approach provides a mechanism to
   represent telic/atelic temporal semantics using temporal annotations. We
   also show how these semantics can be formally defined using constructs
   of the conventional conceptual model and axioms in first-order logic.
   Via what we refer to as the ``semantics of composition,{''} i.e.,
   semantics implied by the interaction of annotations, we illustrate the
   logical consequences of representing telic/atelic data semantics during
   temporal conceptual design.}},

Abstract = {{There are numerous applications where we wish to discover unexpected
   activities in a sequence of time-stamped observation data-for instance,
   we may want to detect inexplicable events in transactions at a website

   set A of activities (both innocuous and dangerous) that we wish to
   monitor. However, in addition, we wish to identify ``unexplained{''}
   subsequences in an observation sequence that are poorly explained (e.
   g., because they may contain occurrences of activities that have never
   been seen or anticipated before, i.e., they are not in A). We formally
   define the probability that a sequence of observations is unexplained
   (totally or partially) w.r.t. A. We develop efficient algorithms to
   identify the top-k Totally and partially unexplained sequences w.r.t. A.
   These algorithms leverage theorems that enable us to speed up the search
   for totally/partially unexplained sequences. We describe experiments
   using real-world video and cyber-security data sets showing that our
   approach works well in practice in terms of both running time and

Title = {{Using soft computing techniques to predict corrected air permeability

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{72-80}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Soft computing techniques are recently becoming very popular in the oil
   industry. A number of computational intelligence-based predictive
   methods have been widely applied in the industry with high prediction
   capabilities. Some of the popular methods include feed-forward neural
   networks, radial basis function network, generalized regression neural
   network, functional networks, support vector regression and adaptive
   network fuzzy inference system.
   A comparative study among most popular soft computing techniques is
   presented using a large dataset published in literature describing
   multimodal pore systems in the Arab D formation. The inputs to the
   models are air porosity, grain density, and Thomeer parameters obtained
   using mercury injection capillary pressure profiles. Corrected air
   permeability is the target variable. Applying developed permeability
   models in recent reservoir characterization workflow ensures consistency
   between micro and macro scale information represented mainly by Thomeer
   parameters and absolute permeability.
   The dataset was divided into two parts with 80\% of data used for
   training and 20\%, for testing. The target permeability variable was
   transformed to the logarithmic scale as a pre-processing step and to
   show better correlations with the input variables. Statistical and
   graphical analysis of the results including permeability cross-plots and
   detailed error measures were created.
   In general, the comparative study showed very close results among the
   developed models. The feed-forward neural network permeability model
   showed the lowest average relative error, average absolute relative
   error, standard deviations of error and root means squares making it the
   best model for such problems. Adaptive network fuzzy inference system
   also showed very good results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   future states following each such action sequence. We also demonstrate
   an information-theoretic method of predicting future utility. Combining
   these methods, we extend empowerment to soft-horizon empowerment which
   enables the player to select a repertoire of action sequences that aim
   to maintain anticipated utility. We show how this method provides a
   proto-heuristic for nonterminal states prior to specifying concrete game
   goals, and propose it as a principled candidate model for
   ``intuitive{''} strategy selection, in line with other recent work on
   ``self-motivated agent behavior.{''} We demonstrate that the technique,
   despite being generically defined independently of scenario, performs
   quite well in relatively disparate scenarios, such as a Sokoban-inspired
   box-pushing scenario and in a Pac-Man-inspired predator game, suggesting
   novel and principle-based candidate routes toward more general
   game-playing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a number of approaches for solving a real-time game
   consisting of a ship that must visit a number of waypoints scattered
   around a 2-D maze full of obstacles. The game, the Physical Traveling
   Salesman Problem (PTSP), which featured in two IEEE conference
   competitions during 2012, provides a good balance between long-term
   planning (finding the optimal sequence of waypoints to visit), and
   short-term planning (driving the ship in the maze). This paper focuses
   on the algorithm that won both PTSP competitions: it takes advantage of
   the physics of the game to calculate the optimal order of waypoints, and
   it employs Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to drive the ship. The
   algorithm uses repetitions of actions (macro actions) to reduce the
   search space for navigation. Variations of this algorithm are presented
   and analyzed, in order to understand the strength of each one of its
   constituents and to comprehend what makes such an approach the best
   controller found so far for the PTSP.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time strategy (RTS) game play is a combination of strategy and
   micromanagement. While strategy is clearly important, the success of a
   strategy can depend greatly on effective micromanagement. Recent years
   have seen an increase in work focusing on micromanagement in RTS AI, but
   the great majority of these works have focused on policies for
   individual units or very specific situations, while very little work has
   aimed to address the need for a broadly applicable structure for unit
   group coordination. This paper conceptualizes RTS group level
   micromanagement as amultiagent task allocation (TA) problem, and
   proposes the micromanagement task allocation system (MTAS) as a
   framework to bridge the gap between strategy and unit level
   micromanagement. MTAS fits into the common layered RTS AI structure, and
   can thus, in principle, be integrated into any existing system based on
   this layered structure. We describe the integration of MTAS into E323AI
   (an existing AI player for the spring RTS engine), and provide empirical
   results demonstrating that MTAS leads to statistically significant
   improvement in performance on the popular RTS game Balanced
   Annihilation.}},

Abstract = {{We present an approach to subjective computing for the design of future
   robots that exhibit more adaptive and flexible behavior in terms of
   subjective intelligence. Instead of encapsulating subjectivity into
   higher order states, we show by means of a relational approach how
   subjective intelligence can be implemented in terms of the reciprocity
   of autonomous self-referentiality and direct world-coupling.
   Subjectivity concerns the relational arrangement of an agent's cognitive
   space. This theoretical concept is narrowed down to the problem of
   coaching a reinforcement learning agent by means of binary feedback.
   Algorithms are presented that implement subjective computing. The
   relational characteristic of subjectivity is further confirmed by a
   questionnaire on human perception of the robot's behavior. The results
   imply that subjective intelligence cannot be externally observed. In
   sum, we conclude that subjective intelligence in relational terms is
   fully tractable and therefore implementable in artificial agents.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) and approximate dynamic
   programming (ADP) have been widely studied in the community of
   artificial intelligence and machine learning. As an important class of
   RL and ADP methods, adaptive critic designs (ACDs) with function
   approximation have been studied to realize online learning control of
   nonlinear dynamical systems. However, how to construct efficient feature
   representations for approximating value functions or policies is still a
   difficult problem. In this paper, ACDs with graph Laplacian (GL) are
   proposed by integrating manifold learning methods into feature
   representations of ACDs. An online learning control algorithm called
   graph Laplacian dual heuristic programming (GL-DHP) is presented, and
   its performance is analyzed both theoretically and empirically. Because
   of the nonlinear approximation ability of feature representation with
   GL, the GL-DHP method has much better performance than previous DHP
   methods with manually designed neural networks. Simulation results on
   learning control of a ball and plate system, which is a typical
   nonlinear dynamical system with continuous state and action spaces,
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the GL-DHP method. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel cognitive system model is established based on
   formal concept analysis to exactly describe human cognitive processes.
   Two new operators, extent-intent and intent-extent, are introduced
   between an object and its attributes. By analyzing the necessity and
   sufficient relations between the object and some of its attributes, the
   information granule concept is investigated in human cognitive
   processes. Furthermore, theories of transforming arbitrary information
   granule into necessary, sufficient, sufficient and necessary information
   granules are addressed carefully. Algorithm of the transformation is
   constructed, by which we can provide an efficient approach to the
   conversion among information granules. To interpret and help understand
   the theories and algorithm, an experimental computing program is
   designed and two cases is employed as case study. Results of the small
   scale case are calculated by the method presented in this paper. The
   large-scale case is calculated by the experimental computing program and
   validated by the proposed algorithm. The considered framework can
   provide a novel convenient tool for artificial intelligence researches.

Abstract = {{The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is one of the most recent
   swarm intelligence based algorithms which simulates the foraging
   behavior of honey bee colonies. In this work, a particle swarm inspired
   multi-elitist ABC algorithm named PS-MEABC is proposed and applied for
   real-parameter optimization. In this modified version, the global best
   solution and an elitist randomly selected from the elitist archive are
   used to modify parameters of each food source in either onlooker bees or
   employed bees phases. PS-MEABC is compared with 5 state-of-the-art swarm
   based algorithms on CEC05 and BBOB12 benchmark functions in terms of
   four metrics: the mean error, the best error, the success rate (SR) and
   the expected running time (ERT). Wilcoxon signed ranks test results on
   the mean and the best error show that the performance of PS-MEABC is
   significantly better than or at least similar to these algorithms, and
   PS-MEABC has wider application range in terms of the success rate and
   faster convergence speed in terms of the expected running time. Our
   algorithm is comparable to its competitors with a fewer control
   parameters to be tuned.}},

Abstract = {{Geodesy utilizes state of the art data collection techniques such as GPS
   (Global Positioning System) to acquire locations of points.
   Traditionally, the coordinates of these points are estimated using the
   Least Squares (LS) method. Nevertheless, Robust Estimation (RE) yields
   more accurate results than LS method in the presence of blunders (gross
   errors) among the data set. For example, the Least Trimmed Squares (LTS)
   method and the Least Median Squares (LMS) method can be used for this
   purpose. The first method aims to minimize the sum of the squared
   residuals by trimming away observations with large residuals. On the
   other hand, the second method involves the minimization of the median of
   the squared residuals. Both methods can be implemented using an
   optimization method, i.e., Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. The
   ABC algorithm is a swarm intelligence (a branch of artificial
   intelligence) technique that can be used for the solution of
   minimization or maximization problems. In this paper, using the LTS and
   LMS methods for GPS data by employing the ABC, a new approach is put
   forward. Firstly, some discussions about the theoretical principals of
   RE and ABC are given. Then, a numerical example is used to demonstrate
   the validity of the proposed approach. Numerical results show that
   application of the robust estimation to GPS data can easily be carried
   out by ABC and this approach helps to enhance the reliability of
   geospatial data for any application of geodesy.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) and rough neural networks (RNNs) both have
   been hot research topics in the artificial intelligence in recent years.
   The former imitates the human brain in dealing with problems, the other
   takes advantage of rough set theory to process questions uncertainly.
   The aim of FNNs and RNNs is to process the massive volume of uncertain
   information, which is widespread applied in our life. This article
   summarizes the recent research development of FNNs and RNNs (together
   called granular neural networks). First the fuzzy neuron and rough
   neuron is introduced; next FNNs are analysed in two categories: normal
   FNNs and fuzzy logic neural networks; then the RNNs are analysed in the
   following four aspects: neural networks based on using rough sets in
   preprocessing information, neural networks based on rough logic, neural
   networks based on rough neuron and neural networks based on
   rough-granular; then we give a flow chart of the RNNs processing
   questions and an application of classical neural networks based on rough
   sets; next this is compared with FNNs and RNNs and the way to integrate
   is described; finally some advice is given on development of FNNs and

Abstract = {{Electric load forecasting is a fundamental business process and
   well-established analytical problem in the utility industry. Due to
   various characteristics of electricity demand series and the business
   needs, electric load forecasting is a classical textbook example and
   popular application field in the forecasting community. During the past
   30 plus years, many statistical and artificial intelligence techniques
   have been applied to short term load forecasting (STLF) with varying
   degrees of success. Although fuzzy regression has been tried for STLF
   for about a decade, most research work is still focused at the
   theoretical level, leaving little value for practical applications. A
   primary reason is that inadequate attention has been paid to the
   improvement of the underlying linear model. This application-oriented
   paper proposes a fuzzy interaction regression approach to STLF. Through
   comparisons to three models (two fuzzy regression models and one
   multiple linear regression model) without interaction effects, the
   proposed approach shows superior performance over its counterparts. This
   paper also offers critical comments to a notable but questionable paper
   in this field. Finally, tips for practicing forecasting using fuzzy
   regression are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing complexity of problems in the construction industry,
   researchers are investigating computationally rigorous intelligent
   systems with the aim of seeking intelligent solutions. The purpose of
   this paper is therefore to analyse the research published on
   `intelligent systems in the construction industry' over the past two
   decades. This is achieved to observe and understand the historical
   trends and current patterns in the use of different types of intelligent
   systems and to exhibit potential directions of further research. Thus,
   to trace the applications of intelligent systems to research in the
   construction industry, a profiling approach is employed to analyse 514
   publications extracted from the Scopus database. The prime value and
   uniqueness of this paper lies in analysing and compiling the existing
   published material by examining variables (such as yearly publications,
   geographic location of each publication, etc.). This has been achieved
   by synthesising existing publications using 14 keywords(2) `Intelligent
   Systems', `Artificial Intelligence', `Expert Systems', `Fuzzy Systems',
   `Genetic Algorithms', `Knowledge-Based Systems', `Neural Networks',
   `Context Aware Applications', `Embedded Systems', `Human-Machine
   Interface', `Sensing and Multiple Sensor Fusion', `Ubiquitous and
   Physical Computing', `Case-based Reasoning' and `Construction Industry'.
   The prime contributions of this research are identified by associating
   (a) yearly publication and geographic location, (b) yearly publication
   and the type of intelligent systems employed/discussed, (c) geographic
   location and the type of research methods employed, and (d) geographic
   location and the types of intelligent systems employed. These
   contributions provide a comparison between the two decades and offer
   insights into the trends in using different intelligent systems types in
   the construction industry. The analysis presented in this paper has
   identified intelligent systems studies that have contributed to the
   development and accumulation of intellectual wealth to the intelligent
   systems area in the construction industry. This research has
   implications for researchers, journal editors, practitioners,
   universities and research institutions. Moreover, it is likely to form
   the basis and motivation for profiling other database resources and
   specific types of intelligent systems journals in this area. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Constant advances in construction planning and site management are
   crucial to improving construction productivity. This paper presents an
   intelligent system MoCCAS (a monolithic construction computer aided
   system), which is a comprehensive decision support tool for flexible
   construction site management in repetitive projects. MoCCAS aids the
   construction site manager in developing optimal and attainable execution
   scenarios by providing contextualized variants of construction
   strategies. The discussion is centered on the modeling procedures of
   repetitive processes with the special focus on the synchronization of
   resources and workflow continuity, which is crucial in scheduling and
   managing repetitive projects. The paper introduces an innovative
   conceptualization of the construction process and presents a dynamic
   three-dimensional construction process model in a temporal perspective.
   How the system synchronizes the work of resources combined into a
   balanced production sets and also supports the decision maker in
   creating what-if scenarios in designing execution strategies is
   discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All fights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Design and control of outdoor lighting systems is a complex task, which
   is made even more difficult by introducing features like dynamic,
   sensor-based operation, multiple lighting levels and sophisticated,
   adjustable luminaires. This paper proposes an integrated approach, based
   on formal graph-based models and methods, to handle both of these tasks.
   The introduced formalisms help handle the state-space explosion related
   to the aforementioned characteristics. Control is performed by means of
   AI techniques (including rule-based systems and pattern matching), which
   is applied to the system using graph transformations. An illustrative,
   simple example is carried out throughout the paper, but the presented
   methods are highly scalable, which made them applicable to several

Abstract = {{Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for the identification of an
   organization's intellectual capital (IC) for decision support and
   providing important managerial insights in knowledge-intensive
   industries. In traditional approaches, identification of an
   organization's IC is usually done manually through interviews, surveys,
   workshops, etc. These methods are labor and time intensive and the
   quality of the results is highly dependent on, among other things, the
   experience of the investigators. This paper presents a Knowledge-based
   Intellectual Capital Extraction (KBICE) algorithm which incorporates the
   technologies of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence
   (AI) for automatic processing of unstructured data and extraction of
   important IC-related information. The performance of KBICE was assessed
   through a series of experiments conducted by using publicly available
   financial reports from the banking industry as the testing batch and
   encouraging results have been obtained. The results showed that, through
   the use of hybrid intelligent matching strategies, it is possible to
   extract commonly referred IC-related information from unstructured data
   automatically. IC information analyst can rely on this method as an
   additional mean to identify and extract the commonly sought IC
   information from financial reports in a fast, systematic and reliable
   manner. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, performance of microbial fuel cell (MFC) has been
   modeled using three potential artificial intelligence (AI) methods such
   as multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), artificial neural network and
   support vector regression. The effect of two input factors namely,
   temperature and ferrous sulfate concentrations on the output voltage
   were studied independently during two operating conditions (before and
   after start-up) using the three AI models. The data is randomly divided
   into training and testing samples containing 80\% and 20\% sets
   respectively and then trained and tested by three AI models. Based on
   the input factor, the proposed AI models predict output voltage of MFC
   at two operating conditions. Out of three methods, the MGGP method not
   only evolve model with better generalization ability but also represents
   an explicit relationship between the output voltage and input factors of
   MFC. The models generated by MGGP approach have shown an excellent
   potential to predict the performance of MFC and can be used to gain
   better insights into the performance of MFC. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, an advanced novel heuristic algorithm is presented, the
   hybrid genetic algorithm with neural networks (HGA-NN), which is used to
   identify an optimum feature subset and to increase the classification
   accuracy and scalability in credit risk assessment. This algorithm is
   based on the following basic hypothesis: the high-dimensional input
   feature space can be preliminarily restricted to only the important
   features. In this preliminary restriction, fast algorithms for feature
   ranking and earlier experience are used. Additionally, enhancements are
   made in the creation of the initial population, as well as by
   introducing an incremental stage in the genetic algorithm. The
   performances of the proposed HGA-NN classifier are evaluated using a
   real-world credit dataset that is collected at a Croatian bank, and the
   findings are further validated on another real-world credit dataset that
   is selected in a UCI database. The classification accuracy is compared
   with that presented in the literature. Experimental results that were
   achieved using the proposed novel HGA-NN classifier are promising for
   feature selection and classification in retail credit risk assessment
   and indicate that the HGA-NN classifier is a promising addition to
   existing data mining techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A model based on semi-fuzzy support vector domain description
   (semi-fuzzy SVDD) is put forward to address multi-classification problem
   involved in supplier selection. By preprocessing using semi-fuzzy kernel
   clustering algorithm, original samples are divided into two subsets:
   deterministic samples and fuzzy samples. Only the fuzzy samples, rather
   than all original ones, require expert judgment to decide their
   categories and are selected as training samples to accomplish SVDD
   specification. Therefore, the samples preprocessing method can not only
   decrease experts working strength, but also achieve less computational
   consumption and better performance of the classifier. Nevertheless, in
   order to accomplish practical decision making, another condition has to
   be met: good explanations to the decision. A rule extraction method
   based on cooperative coevolution algorithm (CCEA), is introduced to
   achieve the target. To validate the proposed methodology, samples from
   real world were employed for experiments, with results compared with
   conventional multi-classification support vector machine approaches and
   other artificial intelligence techniques. Moreover, in terms of rule
   extraction, experiments on key parameters, different methods including
   decompositional and pedagogical ones etc. were also conducted. (C) 2013

Journal = {{COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{50-74}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We present and develop the notion of `universal psychometrics' as a
   subject of study, and eventually a discipline, that focusses on the
   measurement of cognitive abilities for the machine kingdom, which
   comprises any (cognitive) system, individual or collective, either
   artificial, biological or hybrid. Universal psychometrics can be built,
   of course, upon the experience, techniques and methodologies from
   (human) psychometrics, comparative cognition and related areas.
   Conversely, the perspective and techniques which are being developed in
   the area of machine intelligence measurement using (algorithmic)
   information theory can be of much broader applicability and implication
   outside artificial intelligence. This general approach to universal
   psychometrics spurs the re-understanding of most (if not all) of the big
   issues about the measurement of cognitive abilities, and creates a new
   foundation for (re) defining and mathematically formalising the concept
   of cognitive task, evaluable subject, interface, task choice,
   difficulty, agent response curves, etc. We introduce the notion of a
   universal cognitive test and discuss whether (and when) it may be
   necessary for exploring the machine kingdom. On the issue of
   intelligence and very general abilities, we also get some results and
   connections with the related notions of no-free-lunch theorems and
   universal priors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the Border Pairs Method, a constructive
   learning algorithm for multilayer perceptron (MLP). During learning with
   this method a near-minimal network architecture is found. MLP learning
   is conducted separately by individual layers and neurons. The algorithm
   is tested in computer simulation with simple learning patterns (XOR and
   triangles image), with traditional learning patterns (Iris and Pen-Based
   Recognition of Handwritten Digits) and with noisy learning patterns.
   During the learning process we observed the following behaviour of BPM:
   capability to focus on global minima, good generalisation, no problems
   in learning with noisy, multi-dimensional and numerous learning
   patterns. The Border Pairs Method also supports incremental and online
   learning. Both are realized with or without MLP reconstruction and with
   or without forgetting (unlearning). The learning results with the BPM
   method are comparable with results from other methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Volume = {{258}},

Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Swarm intelligence (SI) has generated growing interest in recent decades
   as an algorithm replicating biological and other natural systems.
   Several SI algorithms have been developed that replicate the behavior of
   honeybees. This study integrates two of these, the artificial bee colony
   (ABC) and bees algorithms (BA), into a hybrid ABC-BA algorithm. In
   ABC-BA, an agent can perform as an ABC agent in the ABC sub-swarm and/or
   a BA agent in the BA sub-swarm. Therefore, the ABC and BA formulations
   coexist within ABC-BA. Moreover, the population sizes of the ABC and BA
   sub-swarms vary stochastically based on the current best fitness values
   obtained by the sub-swarms.
   This paper conducts experiments on six constrained optimization problems
   (COPs) with equality or inequality constraints. In addressing equality
   constraints, this paper proposes using these constraints to determine
   function variables rather than directly converting them into inequality
   constraints, an approach that perfectly satisfies the equality
   constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of
   the ABC-BA approximates or exceeds the winner of either ABC or BA.
   Therefore, the ABC-BA is recommended as an alternative to ABC and BA for
   handling COPs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Face recognition is a challenging problem in computer vision and
   artificial intelligence. One of the main challenges consists in
   establishing a low-dimensional feature representation of the images
   having enough discriminatory power to perform high accuracy
   classification. Different methods of supervised and unsupervised
   classification can be found in the literature, but few numerical
   comparisons among them have been performed on the same computing
   platform. In this paper, we perform this kind of comparison, revisiting
   the main spectral decomposition methods for face recognition. We also
   introduce for the first time, the use of the noncentered PCA and the 2D
   discrete Chebyshev transform for biometric applications. Faces are
   represented by their spectral features, that is, their projections onto
   the different spectral basis. Classification is performed using
   different norms and/or the cosine defined by the Euclidean scalar
   product in the space of spectral attributes. Although this constitutes a
   simple algorithm of unsupervised classification, several important
   conclusions arise from this analysis: (1) All the spectral methods
   provide approximately the same accuracy when they are used with the same
   energy cutoff. This is an important conclusion since many publications
   try to promote one specific spectral method with respect to other
   methods. Nevertheless, there exist small variations on the highest
   median accuracy rates: PCA, 2DPCA and DWT perform better in this case.
   Also all the covariance-free spectral decomposition techniques based on
   single images (DCT, DST, DCHT, DWT, DWHT, DHT) are very interesting
   since they provide high accuracies and are not computationally expensive
   compared to covariance-based techniques. (2) The use of local spectral
   features generally provide higher accuracies than global features for
   the spectral methods which use the whole training database (PCA, NPCA,
   2DPCA, Fisher's LDA, ICA). For the methods based on orthogonal
   transformations of single images, global features calculated using the
   whole size of the images appear to perform better. (3) The distance
   criterion generally provides a higher accuracy than the cosine
   criterion. The use of other p-norms (p > 2) provides similar results to
   the Euclidean norm, nevertheless some methods perform better. (4) No
   spectral method can provide 100\% accuracy by itself. Therefore, other
   kind of attributes and supervised learning algorithms are needed. These
   results are coherent for the ORL and FERET databases. Finally, although
   this comparison has been performed for the face recognition problem, it
   could be generalized to other biometric authentication problems.}},

Abstract = {{Pornographic images are disturbing and malicious contents that are
   easily available through Internet technology. It has a negative and
   lasting effect on children who use the Internet; thus, pornography has

   automatically filter pornographic contents is imperative. However, the
   effective interception of pornography remains a challenging issue. In
   this paper, a four-phase anti-pornography system based on the neural and
   Bayesian methods of artificial intelligence is proposed. Primitive
   information on pornography is examined and then used to determine if a
   given image falls under the pornography category. First, we present a
   detailed description of preliminary study phase followed by the modeling
   phase for the proposed skin detector. An anti-pornography system is
   created in the development phase, which also includes the proposed
   pornography classifier based on skin detection. Finally, the performance
   assessment method for the proposed anti-pornography system is discussed

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{AnaPro is software that solves direct anaphora in Spanish, specifically
   pronouns: it finds the noun or group of words to which the pronoun
   refers. It locates in the previous sentences the referent or antecedent
   which the pronoun replaces. An example of a direct anaphora solved is
   the pronoun ``he{''} in the sentence ``He is sad.{''} Much of the work
   on anaphora has been done for texts in English; thus, we specifically
   focus on Spanish documents.
   AnaPro directly supports text analysis (to understand what a document
   says), a non trivial task since there are different writing styles,
   references, idiomatic expressions, etc. The problem grows if the
   analyzer is a computer, because they lack ``common sense{''} (which
   persons possess). Hence, before text analysis, its preprocessing is
   required, in order to assign tags (noun, verb,...) to each word, find
   the stems, disambiguate nouns, verbs, prepositions, identify colloquial
   expressions, identify and resolve anaphora, among other chores.
   AnaPro works for Spanish sentences. It is a novel procedure, since it is
   automatic (no user intervenes during the resolution) and it does not
   need dictionaries. It employs heuristics procedures to discover the
   semantics and help in the decisions; they are rather easy to implement
   and use limited knowledge. Nevertheless, its results are good (81\% of
   correct answers, at least). However, more tests will give a better idea
   of its goodness.}},

Abstract = {{Various heuristic optimization methods have been developed in artificial
   intelligence. These methods are mostly inspired by natural evolution or
   some applicable innovations, which seek good (near-optimal) solutions at
   a reasonable computational cost for search problems. A new iterative
   optimization algorithm is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is based
   on searching the most valuable part of the solution space, which is
   normally concentrated about a targeted bias vector (in the form of a
   dynamic random population). This algorithm greedily searches the
   solution space for global extremum. The comparison results between the
   proposed algorithm and some of the well-known heuristic search methods
   confirm the superiority of our proposed method in solving various
   non-linear optimization problems from the viewpoint of simplicity and

Abstract = {{This study proposes a novel artificial intelligence (AI) model to
   estimate the shear strength of reinforced-concrete (RC) deep beams. The
   proposed evolutionary multivariate adaptive regression splines (EMARS)
   model is a hybrid of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and
   artificial bee colony (ABC). In EMARS, MARS addresses learning and curve
   fitting and ABC implements optimization to determine the optimal
   parameter settings with minimal estimation errors. The proposed model
   was constructed using 106 experimental datasets from the literature.
   EMARS performance was compared with three other data-mining techniques,
   including back-propagation neural network (BPNN), radial basis function
   neural network (RBFNN), and support vector machine (SVM). EMARS
   estimation accuracy was benchmarked against four prevalent mathematical
   methods, including ACI-318 (2011), CSA, CEB-FIP MC90, and Tang's Method.
   Benchmark results identified EMARS as the best model and, thus, an
   efficient alternative approach to estimating RC deep beam shear
   strength. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A multi-gene genetic programming model for estimating stress-dependent
   soil water retention curves}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-56}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Soil water retention curve (SWRC) is an important parameter required for
   seepage modelling in unsaturated soil and is used for analysing
   rainfall-induced slope failures, design of waste contaminant liners and
   cover, etc. The influence of stress, which is one of constitutive
   variables that governs unsaturated soil behaviour on the SWRC, has been
   well recognised by researchers. Stress is essential for study as it
   drastically alters the soil fabric which includes macropores, minipores
   and micropores and thus affects the ability of soil to retain water.
   Various computational modelling techniques that formulate models based
   on existing databases such as UNSODA, ISRIC and HYPRES for the
   estimation of SWRC do not take into account the stress influence on soil
   behaviour. In the present work, three artificial intelligence (AI)
   methods of support vector regression, artificial neural network and
   multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) have been applied to formulate the
   mathematical relationship between the water content and input variables
   such as stress and suction (i.e. stress-dependent soil water
   characteristic curves (SDSWRCs)). The results indicate that the MGGP
   model outperforms the other two models and is able to extrapolate the
   water content values satisfactorily along the stress value of 800 kPa.
   This MGGP model can then be deployed by experts for the estimation of
   SDSWRCs, thus eliminating the need for conducting costly and
   time-consuming experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a novel approach to document ranking in an
   ontology-based document search engine (ODSE) using evidential reasoning

   connection interface to an ODSE are developed. A multiple attribute
   decision making (MADM) tree model is proposed to organise expanded query
   terms. Then, an ER algorithm, based on the Dempster-Shafer theory, is
   used for evidence combination in the MADM tree model. The proposed
   approach is discussed in a generic frame for document ranking, which is
   evaluated using document queries in the domain of electrical substation
   fault diagnosis. The results show that the proposed approach provides a
   suitable solution to document ranking and the precision at the same
   recall levels for ODSE searches have been improved significantly with ER
   embedded, in comparison with a traditional keyword-matching search
   engine, an ODSE without ER and a non-randomness-based weighting model.}},

   affect the surface roughness and flank wear. The results show that the
   feed rate, nose radius, and approach angle have a significant effect on
   the flank wear and the surface roughness, but the cutting velocity has a
   significant effect on the flank wear alone. The optimum values of
   cutting parameters were identified and the resultant optimum values of
   flank wear and surface roughness were found to be in good agreement with
   the results of a validation experiment under a similar condition. The
   optimized values showed a significant reduction in roughness and flank

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient meta-heuristic algorithm based on

   electromagnetism-like method scheme. To work around potentially
   computational intractability and improved the capability of suppressing
   multiple access interference (MAI) for Multicarrier CDMA System, the
   proposed scheme exploits heuristics in consideration of both global and
   local exploration of the step size of the CMA. Simulation results
   obtained confirm that faster convergence and desirable BER performance
   with low computational complexity can be achieved with
   electromagnetism-like method based CMA scheme, compared with the
   previous step-size CMA scheme, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm

Abstract = {{Litigation in court is still the main dispute resolution mode. However,
   given the amount and characteristics of the new disputes, mostly arising
   out of electronic contracting, courts are becoming slower and outdated.

   techniques, supported by technology, aimed at facilitating conflict
   resolution. In this paper we present a critical evaluation on the use of
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques in ODR. In order to
   fulfill this goal, we analyze a set of commercial providers (in this
   case twenty four) and some research projects (in this circumstance six).
   Supported by the results so far achieved, a new approach to deal with
   the problem of ODR is proposed, in which we take on some of the problems
   identified in the current state of the art in linking ODR and AI.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and effective diagnosis of actual injury severity can be
   problematic in trauma patients. Inherent physiologic compensatory
   mechanisms may prevent accurate diagnosis and mask true severity in many
   circumstances. The objective of this project was the development and
   validation of a multiparameter machine learning algorithm and system
   capable of predicting the need for life-saving interventions (LSIs) in
   trauma patients. Statistics based on means, slopes, and maxima of
   various vital sign measurements corresponding to 79 trauma patient
   records generated over 110,000 feature sets, which were used to develop,
   train, and implement the system. Comparisons among several machine
   learning models proved that a multilayer perceptron would best implement
   the algorithm in a hybrid system consisting of a machine learning
   component and basic detection rules. Additionally, 295,994 feature sets
   from 82 h of trauma patient data showed that the system can obtain 89.8
   \% accuracy within 5 min of recorded LSIs. Use of machine learning
   technologies combined with basic detection rules provides a potential
   approach for accurately assessing the need for LSIs in trauma patients.
   The performance of this system demonstrates that machine learning
   technology can be implemented in a real-time fashion and potentially
   used in a critical care environment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel class of algorithms, called
   Heuristically-Accelerated Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (HAMRL),
   which allows the use of heuristics to speed up well-known multiagent
   reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as the Minimax-Q. Such HAMRL
   algorithms are characterized by a heuristic function, which suggests the
   selection of particular actions over others. This function represents an
   initial action selection policy, which can be handcrafted, extracted
   from previous experience in distinct domains, or learnt from
   observation. To validate the proposal, a thorough theoretical analysis
   proving the convergence of four algorithms from the HAMRL class (HAMMQ,
   HAMQ(lambda), HAMQS, and HAMS) is presented. In addition, a
   comprehensive systematical evaluation was conducted in two distinct
   adversarial domains. The results show that even the most straightforward
   heuristics can produce virtually optimal action selection policies in
   much fewer episodes, significantly improving the performance of the
   HAMRL over vanilla RL algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{It is difficult to express the parallelism present in complex
   computations by using existing higher level abstractions such as
   MapReduce and Dryad. These computations include applications from wide
   variety of domains, like Artificial Intelligence, Decision Tree
   Algorithms, Association Rule Mining, Recommender Systems, Graph
   Algorithms, Clustering Algorithms, Compute Intensive Scientific
   Workflows, Optimization Algorithms, and so forth. Their execution graphs
   introduce new challenges in terms of programmer expressibility and
   runtime performance such as iterative and recursive computations, shared
   communication model, and so forth. We propose an extension to MapReduce,
   called Generate-Map-Reduce (GMR), targeted towards modeling these
   applications. GMR introduces a new Generate abstraction into the
   MapReduce framework that captures recursive computations. The runtime
   also supports iterative jobs and a distributed communication model by
   using shared data structures. We illustrate recursive computations with
   GMR by modeling complex applications such as simulated annealing, A{*}
   search, and adaptive quadrature computation that require recursive
   spawning of new tasks to handle variable degree of parallelism. GMR
   runtime supports caching of common data across iterations in memory and
   local disks. We illustrate how this caching helps in achieving
   significant speedup for iterative computations by modeling k-means
   clustering. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The recent growth of agent-based software systems was achieved without
   the development of a reference architecture. From a software engineering
   standpoint, a reference architecture is necessary to compare, evaluate,
   and integrate past, current, and future agent-based software systems.
   The agent systems reference architecture (ASRA) advances the agent-based
   system development process by providing a set of key interaction
   patterns for functional areas that exist between the layers and
   protocols of agent-based systems. Furthermore, the ASRA identifies the
   points for interoperability between agent-based systems and increases
   the level of discussion when referring to agent-based systems. This
   paper presents methodology, grounded in software forensics, to develop
   the ASRA and provides an overview of the resulting architectural
   representation. The methodology uses an approach based on software
   engineering techniques adapted to study agent frameworks-the libraries
   and tools for building agent systems. The resulting ASRA can serve as an
   abstract representation of the components necessary for facilitating
   comparison, integration, and interoperation of software systems composed

Abstract = {{Fault detection and diagnosis are important issues in process
   engineering. Hence, a considerable interest exists in this field now
   from industrial practitioners as well as academic researchers, as
   opposed to 30 years ago. The literature on process fault diagnosis,
   ranging from analytical methods to artificial intelligence and
   statistical approaches, is largely widespread. In this paper, the
   modeling of the real process is known, and the state-space
   representation is used The properties of the Finite Memory Observer
   (FM()) are studied from a global point of view for the class of linear
   time-varying (LTV) systems with stochastic noises. The FMO performances
   are framed by the study of their properties, and that of their
   influences on diagnosis results. Fundamentally, the generation of
   residuals is an essential procedure in diagnosis. So, the determination
   of the optimal window length of the observer is resolved, and the
   generation of residuals for diagnosis completed. In the first part, the
   design of the observer and the residual generation are shown. The second
   part is devoted to the study of the sensitivity and robustness of the
   observer and of residuals generated from the observer. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an optimal feature and parameter selection approach
   for extreme learning machine (ELM) for classifying power system
   disturbances. The relevant features of non-stationary time series data
   from power disturbances are extracted using a multiresolution
   S-transform which can be treated either as a phase corrected wavelet
   transform or a variable window short-time Fourier transform. After
   extracting the relevant features from the time series data, an
   integrated PSO and ELM architectures are used for pattern recognition of
   disturbance waveform data. The particle swarm optimization is a powerful
   meta-heuristic technique in artificial intelligence field; therefore,
   this study proposes a PSO-based approach, to specify the beneficial
   features and the optimal parameter to enhance the performance of ELM.
   One of the advantages of ELM over other methods is that the parameter
   that the user must properly adjust is the number of hidden nodes only.
   In this paper, a hybrid optimization mechanism is proposed which
   combines the discrete-valued PSO with the continuous-valued PSO to
   optimize the input feature subset selection and the number of hidden
   nodes to enhance the performance of ELM. The experimental results showed
   the proposed algorithm is faster and more accurate in discriminating
   power system disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is focused on comparison of effectiveness of artificial

   minimizing the errors from the experimental set-up. Four bearing
   conditions such as bearing with outer race defect, inner race defect,
   ball defect and combined defect on outer race, inner race and ball have
   been used in this paper. Localized defects of micron level are induced

Abstract = {{An increasing number of social computational systems consist of a great
   amount of autonomous entities and operate in highly dynamic and
   unpredictable environments. To construct such systems needs to seek
   high-level abstraction to manage the complexity of the systems and novel
   mechanism to support their characteristics, i.e., dynamism and
   flexibility. Agent-oriented programming (AOP) is considered as a
   potential paradigm for developing such systems by exhibiting a number of
   characteristics, such as autonomy, flexibility, social ability, etc.
   However, current researches on AOP mainly focus on the construction of
   multi-agent system (MAS) with theory and language facilities inspired
   from artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed AI, seldom considering
   and integrating the proven principles and practices of programming and
   software engineering. Moreover, abstractions and mechanism based on AI
   are inadequate for developing dynamic and flexible MAS in open
   environment. This paper proposes a novel AOP approach, namely Oragent,
   for constructing and implementing dynamic and flexible systems. From a
   software engineering perspective, Oragent integrates organizational
   concepts and mechanism into AOP language, and support the dynamism and
   flexibility with explicit primitives. The proposed approach consists of
   a programming model and a corresponding programming language. This paper
   presents the syntax and formal operational semantics of Oragent
   language, and studies a case to demonstrate our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Testing concurrent programs is a challenging problem due to interleaving
   explosion: even for a fixed set of inputs, there is a huge number of
   concurrent runs that need to be tested to account for scheduler
   behavior. Testing all possible schedules is not practical. Consequently,
   most effective testing algorithms only test a select subset of runs. For
   example, limiting testing to runs that contain data races or atomicity
   violations has been shown to capture a large proportion of concurrency
   bugs. In this paper we present a general approach to concurrent program
   testing that is based on techniques from artificial intelligence (AI)
   automated planning. We propose a framework for predicting concurrent
   program runs that violate a collection of generic correctness
   specifications for concurrent programs, namely runs that contain data
   races, atomicity violations, or null-pointer dereferences. Our
   prediction is based on observing an arbitrary run of the program, and
   using information collected from this run to model the behavior of the
   program, and to predict new runs that contain bugs with one of the above
   noted violation patterns. We characterize the problem of predicting such
   new runs as an AI sequential planning problem with the temporally
   extended goal of achieving a particular violation pattern. In contrast
   to many state-of-the-art approaches, in our approach feasibility of the
   predicted runs is guaranteed and, therefore, all generated runs are
   fully usable for testing. Moreover, our planning-based approach has the
   merit that it can easily accommodate a variety of violation patterns
   which serve as the selection criteria for guiding search in the state
   space of concurrent runs. This is achieved by simply modifying the
   planning goal. We have implemented our approach using state-of-the-art
   AI planning techniques and tested it within the Penelope concurrent
   program testing framework {[}35]. Nevertheless, the approach is general
   and is amenable to a variety of program testing frameworks. Our
   experiments with a benchmark suite showed that our approach is very fast
   and highly effective, finding all known bugs.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the 3D conformation of proteins is a necessity to
   understand their functions or interactions with other molecules. It is
   commonly admitted that, when proteins fold from their primary linear
   structures to their final 3D conformations, they tend to choose the ones
   that minimize their free energy. To find the 3D conformation of a
   protein knowing its amino acid sequence, bioinformaticians use various
   models of different resolutions and artificial intelligence tools, as
   the protein folding prediction problem is a NP complete one. More
   precisely, to determine the backbone structure of the protein using the
   low resolution models (2D HP square and 3D HP cubic), by finding the
   conformation that minimizes free energy, is intractable exactly. Both
   proofs of NP-completeness and the 2D prediction consider that acceptable
   conformations have to satisfy a self-avoiding walk (SAW) requirement, as
   two different amino acids cannot occupy a same position in the lattice.
   It is shown in this document that the SAW requirement considered when
   proving NP-completeness is different from the SAW requirement used in
   various prediction programs, and that they are different from the real
   biological requirement. Indeed, the proof of NP completeness and the
   predictions in silico consider conformations that are not possible in
   practice. Consequences of this fact are investigated in this research
   work.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, event related potential (ERP) generated due to hand
   movement is detected through the adaptive noise canceller (ANC) from the
   electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. ANCs are implemented with least mean

   technique. Performance of this algorithm is evaluated in terms of signal
   to noise ratio (SNR) in dB, correlation between resultant and template
   ERP, and mean value. Testing of their noise attenuation capability is
   done on EEG contaminated with white noise at different SNR levels. A
   comparative study of the performance of conventional gradient based
   methods like LMS, NLMS and RLS, and swarm intelligence based PSO, BFO,

   better performance in average cases of noisy environment with minimum

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{205-224}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an integrated algorithm for forecasting annual
   electrical energy consumption based on Artificial Immune System (AIS),
   Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and computer
   simulation. Computer simulation is developed to generate random
   variables for annual electricity consumptions in selected countries.
   Most recent studies are concerned with deterministic data sets which
   could enhance relative error. However, this study utilizes fitted random
   variables as input data to decrease the relative error. Mean Absolute
   Percentage Error (MAPE) is used for evaluating the results and selecting
   the best forecasting model. To show the applicability of the proposed
   algorithm, the annual electricity consumptions for 16 countries from
   1980 to 2006 are considered and the proposed algorithm is applied to the
   corresponding historical data. Three considered meta-heuristics (i.e.
   AIS, GA, and PSO) are compared with each other in estimation of
   electricity consumption in the selected countries. The comparison is
   made based on MAPE for the test period data. For the selected countries,
   AIS method with the Clonal Selection Algorithm (CLONALG) shows
   satisfactory results when applied with simulated data and has been
   selected as the preferred method. This is the first study that uses an
   integrated AIS-simulation for improved forecasting of electricity
   consumption with random variations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a multi-objective artificial bee colony
   (MOABC) algorithm and compare its efficiency with other existing
   algorithms for short-term scheduling of hydrothermal systems. We
   formulate the short-term combined economic and emission dispatch of
   hydrothermal systems as a complicated nonlinear optimization problem
   with a group of complex constraints. We modify the select operator of
   artificial bee colony algorithm to adapt the multi-objective problem
   optimization, and change the employed bee phase and probability
   calculation of onlooker bee phase to avoid local maxima. Furthermore, we
   utilize a progressive optimality algorithm based method to enhance the
   local search ability of the MOABC. Moreover, the constraint handling
   method has been proposed to resolve the complex constraints. We
   demonstrate the performance of the MOABC algorithm and compare it with
   other existing algorithms using the data from a hydrothermal power
   system in three different cases. The results show that the MOABC can
   obtain better schedule results with less fuel cost and environment
   pollution, more close to the true Pareto front and better
   diversification of non-dominated solutions compared to other existing
   methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Of the many kinds of renewable energy, wind power is low in cost and
   non-polluting, so it is especially well-suited to Taiwan. The Mai Liao
   Wind Farm is the most important wind farm in Taiwan, and forecasting the
   wind power output for national sustainable development continues to be a
   challenging research feature. In this study, we attempt to forecast the
   wind power data collected from the Mai Liao Wind Farm. Our forecast
   model is based on a Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network
   (MLP) model using the data collected at the Mai Liao Wind Farm over a
   period of five years from September 2002 to August 2007. We proposed a
   new algorithm, namely improved Simplified Swarm Optimization (iSSO),
   which improves Simplified Swarm Optimization (SSO) by justifying the
   weights and bias in training the MLP. The proposed iSSO combines
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autocorrelation Function (AF) and
   Partial Autocorrelation Function (PAF) for the selection of features
   which increases the efficiency of the proposed model. The experimental
   results demonstrate that the performance of iSSO outperforms the other
   six most popular algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   networks) consider a priori knowledge, such as demographics or patient
   physical factors, providing accurate methods to estimate LOS at early
   stages of the patient (admission). However, unexpected scenarios and
   variations are common places of clinical treatment processes that have a
   dramatical impact on the LOS. Therefore, these predictors should deal
   with adaptability, considering the temporal evolution of the patient. In
   this paper, we propose an inpatient LOS prediction approach across
   various stages of clinical treatment processes. This proposal relies on
   a kind of regularity assumption demanding that patient traces of the
   specific treatment process with similar medical behaviors have similar
   LOS. Therefore, this approach follows a Case-based Reasoning methodology
   since it predicts an inpatient LOS of a partial patient trace by
   referring to the past traces of clinical treatment processes that have
   similar medical behaviors with the current one. The proposal is
   evaluated using 284 patient traces from the pulmonary infection CTPs,
   extracted from Zhejiang Huzhou Central Hospital of China. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{An online group testing method to search for a hidden object in a
   discrete search space is proposed. A relevant example is a search after
   a nonconforming unit in a batch, while many other applications can be
   related. A probability mass function is defined over the search space to
   represent the probability of an object (e.g., a nonconforming unit) to
   be located at some point or subspace. The suggested method follows a
   stochastic local search procedure and can be viewed as a generalization
   of the Learning Real-Time A{*} (LRTA{*}) search algorithm, while using
   informational distance measures over the searched space. It is proved
   that the proposed Informational LRTA{*} (ILRTA{*}) algorithm converges
   and always terminates. Moreover, it is shown that under relevant
   assumptions, the proposed algorithm generalizes known optimal
   information-theoretic search procedures, such as the offline Huffman
   search or the generalized optimum testing algorithm. However, the
   ILRTA{*} can be applied to new situations, such as a search with side
   information or an online search where the probability distribution
   changes. The obtained results can help to bridge the gap between
   different search procedures that are related to quality control,
   artificial intelligence, and information theory.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforcement learning (RL) agents like Hutter's universal, Pareto
   optimal, incomputable AIXI heavily rely on the definition of the
   rewards, which are necessarily given by some ``teacher{''} to define the
   tasks to solve. Therefore, as is, AIXI. cannot be said to be a fully
   autonomous agent. From the point of view of artificial general
   intelligence (AGI), this can be argued to be an incomplete definition of
   a generally intelligent agent.
   Furthermore, it has recently been shown that AIXI can converge to a
   suboptimal behavior in certain situations, hence showing the intrinsic
   difficulty of RL, with its non-obvious pitfalls.
   We propose a new model of intelligence, the knowledge-seeking agent
   (KSA), halfway between Solomonoff induction and AIXI, that defines a
   completely autonomous agent that does not require a teacher. The goal of
   this agent is not to maximize arbitrary rewards, but to entirely explore
   its world in an optimal way. A proof of strong asymptotic optimality for
   a class of horizon functions shows that this agent behaves according to
   expectation. Some implications of such an unusual agent are proposed.

Abstract = {{In this paper new computational intelligence techniques have been
   developed for the nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) Jeffery-Hamel
   flow problem using three different feed-forward artificial neural
   networks trained with an interior point method. The governing equation
   for the two-dimensional MHD Jeffery-Hamel flow problem is transformed
   into an equivalent third order nonlinear ordinary differential equation.
   Three neural network models using log-sigmoid, radial basis and
   tan-sigmoid activation functions are developed for the transformed
   equation in an unsupervised manner. The training of weights of each
   neural network is carried out with an interior point method. The
   proposed models are evaluated on different variants of the Jeffery-Hamel
   problem by varying the Reynolds number, angles of the walls and the
   Hartmann number. The accuracy, convergence and effectiveness of the
   designed models are validated through statistical analyses based on a
   sufficiently large number of independent runs. Comparative studies of
   the proposed solutions with standard numerical results, as well as
   recently reported solutions of analytic solvers illustrate the worth of
   the proposed solvers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The control of oxygen blowing volume and coolant addition amount is very
   important in the production of Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF). In this
   paper, for oxygen blowing volume and coolant addition amount
   calculation, a combination model is proposed based on information theory
   and artificial intelligence technology, which is composed of Case-based
   Reasoning (CBR) model and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. For the
   former, mutual information is introduced to determine the weights of
   attributes and make the retrieval step more valid than traditional
   method. For the latter, mutual information is adopted to distinguish the
   importance of input variables by setting a weight for each variable. The
   CBR model is considered as experience-based model and the SVM model is a
   data-based model. To solve the control problems of oxygen blowing volume
   and coolant addition amount, CBR model and SVM model are combined by
   conditional entropy. Tests on a 180 t BOF data substantiate the
   effectiveness of the proposed model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Most previous work on artificial curiosity (AC) and intrinsic motivation
   focuses on basic concepts and theory. Experimental results are generally
   limited to toy scenarios, such as navigation in a simulated maze, or
   control of a simple mechanical system with one or two degrees of
   freedom. To study AC in a more realistic setting, we embody a curious
   agent in the complex iCub humanoid robot. Our novel reinforcement
   learning (RL) framework consists of a state-of-the-art, low-level,
   reactive control layer, which controls the iCub while respecting
   constraints, and a high-level curious agent, which explores the iCub's
   state-action space through information gain maximization, learning a
   world model from experience, controlling the actual iCub hardware in
   real-time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever
   embodied, curious agent for real-time motion planning on a humanoid. We
   demonstrate that it can learn compact Markov models to represent large
   regions of the iCub's configuration space, and that the iCub explores
   intelligently, showing interest in its physical constraints as well as
   in objects it finds in its environment.}},

Abstract = {{We present a large-scale investigation of the variability of run times
   on physical and virtualised hardware. The aim of our investigation is to
   establish whether cloud infrastructures are suitable for running
   computational experiments in which the results rely on reported run
   times. Our application is the use of the Minion constraint solver as an
   example of an Artificial Intelligence experiment. We include two major
   providers of public cloud infrastructure, Amazon and Rackspace, as well
   as a private Eucalyptus cloud. Although there are many studies in the
   literature that investigate the performance of cloud environments, the
   problem of whether this performance is consistent and run time
   measurements are reliable has been largely ignored. Our comprehensive
   experiments and detailed analysis of the results show that there is no
   intrinsic disadvantage of virtualised hardware over physical hardware
   and that in general cloud environments are suitable for running
   computational experiments. Our meticulous investigation reveals several
   interesting patterns in the variability of run times that researchers
   using a cloud for this purpose should be aware of. We close by giving
   recommendations as to which type of virtual machine with which cloud
   provider should be used to achieve reproducible results.}},

Title = {{A Hidden Markov Model-Based Acoustic Cicada Detector for Crowdsourced
   Smartphone Biodiversity Monitoring}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{805-827}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, the field of computational sustainability has striven
   to apply artificial intelligence techniques to solve ecological and
   environmental problems. In ecology, a key issue for the safeguarding of
   our planet is the monitoring of biodiversity. Automated acoustic
   recognition of species aims to provide a cost-effective method for
   biodiversity monitoring. This is particularly appealing for detecting
   endangered animals with a distinctive call, such as the New Forest
   cicada. To this end, we pursue a crowdsourcing approach, whereby the
   millions of visitors to the New Forest, where this insect was
   historically found, will help to monitor its presence by means of a
   smartphone app that can detect its mating call. Existing research in the
   field of acoustic insect detection has typically focused upon the
   classification of recordings collected from fixed field microphones.
   Such approaches segment a lengthy audio recording into individual
   segments of insect activity, which are independently classified using
   cepstral coefficients extracted from the recording as features. This
   paper reports on a contrasting approach, whereby we use crowdsourcing to
   collect recordings via a smartphone app, and present an immediate
   feedback to the users as to whether an insect has been found. Our
   classification approach does not remove silent parts of the recording
   via segmentation, but instead uses the temporal patterns throughout each
   recording to classify the insects present. We show that our approach can
   successfully discriminate between the call of the New Forest cicada and
   similar insects found in the New Forest, and is robust to common types
   of environment noise. A large scale trial deployment of our smartphone
   app collected over 6000 reports of insect activity from over 1000 users.
   Despite the cicada not having been rediscovered in the New Forest, the
   effectiveness of this approach was confirmed for both the detection
   algorithm, which successfully identified the same cicada through the app
   in countries where the same species is still present, and of the
   crowdsourcing methodology, which collected a vast number of recordings
   and involved thousands of contributors.}},

Title = {{Sequentially Dependent Meta-Constraint Satisfaction Problem: An
   Application to Video Games}},
Journal = {{ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{204-216}},
Abstract = {{A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) consists in a sequence of
   variables holding a domain of possible values and relations among these
   variables called constraints. A meta-CSP can be seen as a metaproblem
   whose decomposition leads to a set of CSPs. The meta-variables
   correspond to sub-problems of the original problem, and a
   meta-constraint is a relation among those meta-variables. Meta-CSPs find
   many applications in industry, usually in processes that involve time
   and actions such as the control of a robot, a manufacturing process, or
   the scheduling of any common activity. In this paper, we introduce the
   notion of Sequentially Dependent Meta-CSP (SD Meta-CSP), which extends
   the meta-CSP in order to support applications where a dependency between
   sub-problems is mandatory. In this case, the meta-CSP is decomposed into
   a set of sub-problems \{P-i, Pi+1,..., P-n\}, but the instance of the
   sub-problem Pi+1 sequentially depends on the solution of the sub-problem
   P-i. In this work we provide a formal definition for the SD Meta-CSPs, a
   framework to handle it, and we illustrate its applicability to video
   games. In particular, we model and implement agents as SD Meta-CSPs able
   to autonomously play two classic games: Ms. Pac-Man and Super Mario
   Bros.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS}},

Pages = {{1004-1024}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, two hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) based models were
   introduced for rainfall-runoff modeling. In the first model, a genetic
   fuzzy system (GFS) was developed and evolved for the prediction of
   watersheds' runoff one time step ahead. In the second model, the
   wavelet-GFS (WGFS) model, wavelet transform was also used as a data
   pre-processing method prior to GFS modeling and in this way the main
   time series of two variables (rainfall and runoff) were decomposed into
   some multi-frequency time series by the wavelet transform. Then, the GFS
   was trained using the transformed time series, and finally the runoff
   discharge was predicted one time step ahead. In addition, to specify the
   capability and reliability of the proposed WGFS model, multi-step ahead
   runoff forecasting was also implemented for the watersheds. The obtained
   results through the application of the models for rainfall-runoff
   modeling of two distinct watersheds, located in Azerbaijan, Iran showed
   that the runoff could be better forecasted through the proposed WGFS
   model than other AI-based models in terms of determination coefficient
   and root mean squared error criteria in both training and verifying
   steps.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors investigate the potentials of an aggregated

   The resulted global identifier synchronously uses the local maps to
   predict the fuel consumption (FC) rate of a PHEV for a specific drive
   cycle. To do so, an experimental/simulative sampling process was
   performed in smart hybrid and electric vehicle system laboratory at the
   University of Waterloo to create a database including a set of
   input/output pairs. After extracting knowledge from prepared database,

Abstract = {{Purpose - The active power filter with two-level inverter needs a
   high-rating coupling transformer for high-power applications. This
   complicates the control and system becomes bulky and expensive. The
   purpose of this paper is to motivate the use of multilevel inverter as
   harmonic filter, which eliminates the coupling transformer and allows
   direct control of the power circuit. The advancement in artificial
   intelligence (AI) for computation is explored for controller design.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed scheme has a five-level
   cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter (CHBMLI) as a harmonic filter. The
   control scheme includes one neural network controller and two fuzzy
   logic-based controllers for harmonic extraction, dc capacitor voltage
   balancing, and compensating current adjustment, respectively. The
   topology is modeled in MATLAB/SIMULINK and implemented using dSPACE
   DS1103 interface for experimentation.
   Findings - The exhaustive simulation and experimental results
   demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed topology
   and controllers for harmonic minimization for RL/RC load and change in
   load. The comparison between traditional PI controller and proposed
   AI-based controller is presented. It indicates that the AI-based
   controller is fast, dynamic, and adaptive to accommodate the changes in
   load. The total harmonic distortion obtained by applying AI-based
   controllers are well within the IEEE519 std. limits.
   Originality/value - The simulation of high-power, medium-voltage system
   is presented and a downscaled prototype is designed and developed for
   implementation. The laboratory module of CHBMLI-based harmonic filter
   and AI-based controllers modeled in SIMULINK is executed using dSPACE
   DS1103 interface through real time workshop.}},

   FCPPs, as Distributed Generation (DG) units, can be taken into account
   as combined sources of Heat, Power, and Hydrogen (CHPH). The overall
   system efficiency can be improved by CHPH operation of FCPPs. Also, it
   will produce hydrogen which can be stored for the future use of FCPPs or
   can be sold to make a profit. The objective functions under
   investigation consist of the operating costs of electrical energy
   generation of distribution substations and FCPPs, the voltage deviation
   and the total emission. In this paper, only the placement of CHPH FCPPs
   is considered while investment cost of devices is not considered. Owing
   to the different, non-commensurable and nonlinear objectives, using
   conventional single-objective approaches makes difficulties to solve the
   problem. Other than that, the placement of FCPP in distribution systems
   is a mixed integer problem. Therefore, in order to overcome these
   problems, the firefly algorithm is utilized. In addition, a new
   two-stage modification is employed to search the problem area globally.
   Due to the multi-objective characteristic of the optimization,
   implementing the proposed MFA leads to obtain a set of solution in the
   problem instead of only one. The proposed algorithm is tested on a
   69-bus distribution system to validate the effectiveness and
   impressiveness of the approach.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Bayesian network is an important theoretical model in artificial
   intelligence field and also a powerful tool for processing uncertainty
   issues. Considering the slow convergence speed of current Bayesian
   network structure learning algorithms, a fast hybrid learning method is
   proposed in this paper. We start with further analysis of information
   provided by low-order conditional independence testing, and then two
   methods are given for constructing graph model of network, which is
   theoretically proved to be upper and lower bounds of the structure space
   of target network, so that candidate sets are given as a result; after
   that a search and scoring algorithm is operated based on the candidate
   sets to find the final structure of the network. Simulation results show
   that the algorithm proposed in this paper is more efficient than similar
   algorithms with the same learning precision.}},

Title = {{Artificial Intelligence Mechanisms on Interactive Modified Simplex
   Method with Desirability Function for Optimising Surface Lapping Process}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{A study has been made to optimise the influential parameters of surface
   lapping process. Lapping time, lapping speed, downward pressure, and
   charging pressure were chosen from the preliminary studies as parameters
   to determine process performances in terms of material removal, lap
   width, and clamp force. The desirability functions of
   the-nominal-the-best were used to compromise multiple responses into the
   overall desirability function level or D response. The conventional
   modified simplex or Nelder-Mead simplex method and the interactive
   desirability function are performed to optimise online the parameter
   levels in order to maximise the D response. In order to determine the
   lapping process parameters effectively, this research then applies two
   powerful artificial intelligence optimisation mechanisms from harmony
   search and firefly algorithms. The recommended condition of (lapping
   time, lapping speed, downward pressure, and charging pressure) at (33,
   35, 6.0, and 5.0) has been verified by performing confirmation
   experiments. It showed that the D response level increased to 0.96. When
   compared with the current operating condition, there is a decrease of
   the material removal and lap width with the improved process performance
   indices of 2.01 and 1.14, respectively. Similarly, there is an increase
   of the clamp force with the improved process performance index of 1.58.}},

Title = {{Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm and Particle Swarm Search for
   Global Optimization}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is one of the most recent swarm
   intelligence based algorithms, which has been shown to be competitive to
   other population-based algorithms. However, there is still an
   insufficiency in ABC regarding its solution search equation, which is
   good at exploration but poor at exploitation. To overcome this problem,
   we propose a novel artificial bee colony algorithm based on particle
   swarm search mechanism. In this algorithm, for improving the convergence
   speed, the initial population is generated by using good point set
   theory rather than random selection firstly. Secondly, in order to
   enhance the exploitation ability, the employed bee, onlookers, and
   scouts utilize the mechanism of PSO to search new candidate solutions.
   Finally, for further improving the searching ability, the chaotic search
   operator is adopted in the best solution of the current iteration. Our
   algorithm is tested on some well-known benchmark functions and compared
   with other algorithms. Results show that our algorithm has good
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Electricity markets are complex environments, involving a large number
   of different entities, playing in a dynamic scene to obtain the best
   advantages and profits. MASCEM (Multi-Agent System for Competitive
   Electricity Markets) is a multiagent electricity market simulator that
   models market players and simulates their operation in the market.
   Market players are entities with specific characteristics and
   objectives, making their decisions and interacting with other players.
   This paper presents a methodology to provide decision support to
   electricity market negotiating players. This model allows integrating
   different strategic approaches for electricity market negotiations, and
   choosing the most appropriate one at each time, for each different
   negotiation context. This methodology is integrated in ALBidS (Adaptive
   Learning strategic Bidding System) - a multiagent system that provides
   decision support to MASCEM's negotiating agents so that they can
   properly achieve their goals. ALBidS uses artificial intelligence
   methodologies and data analysis algorithms to provide effective adaptive
   learning capabilities to such negotiating entities. The main
   contribution is provided by a methodology that combines several distinct
   strategies to build actions proposals, so that the best can be chosen at
   each time, depending on the context and simulation circumstances. The
   choosing process includes reinforcement learning algorithms, a mechanism
   for negotiating contexts analysis, a mechanism for the management of the
   efficiency/effectiveness balance of the system, and a mechanism for
   competitor players' profiles definition.}},

Abstract = {{Processing a huge amount of information takes extensive execution time
   and computational sources most of the time with low classification
   accuracy. As a result, it is needed to employ a phase of pre-analysis
   processing, which can influence the performance of execution time and
   computational sources and classification accuracy. One of the most
   important phases of preprocessing is Feature selection, which can
   improve the classification accuracy of steganalysis. The experiments are
   accomplished by using a large and important data set of 686 features
   vectores named SPAM. One of the promising application domains for such a
   feature selection process is steganalysis. In this paper, we propose a
   new metaheuristic approach for image steganalysis method for detecting
   stego images from the cover images in JPEG images using a feature
   selection technique based on an improved artificial bee colony. Within
   the ABC structure the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) method is employed for
   fitness evaluation. ABC and kNN have been adjusted together to make an
   operative dimension reduction method Experimental results demonstrate
   the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed technique compared to

Abstract = {{Duralumin is an alloy of aluminium which has some unique properties such
   as high strength to weight ratio, high resistance to corrosion, light in
   weight, and more demanding alloy in various sectors such as space craft,
   marine, chemical industries, construction and automobile. These
   applications require very precise and complex shapes which may not be
   obtained with conventional machining. Pulsed Nd:YAG laser cutting may be
   used to fulfill these objectives by using optimum setting of process
   parameters. The present research paper has experimentally investigated
   the modeling and optimization of heat affected zone in the pulsed Nd:YAG
   laser cutting of Duralumin sheet with the aim to minimize heat affected
   zone. The quality is improved by the proper control of different process
   parameters such as gas pressure, pulse width, pulse frequency and
   scanning speed. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been used
   to solve the many engineering problems successfully through development
   of Genetic Algorithm (GA), Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Artificial Neural
   Network (ANN) systems. The optimization of heat affected zone has been
   carried out by using Hybrid Approach of Multiple Regression Analysis
   (MRA) and GA. In this methodology, the second order regression model has
   been developed by using MRA with the help of experimental data obtained
   by L-27 orthogonal array (OA). Further this equation has been used as
   objective function in GA based optimization. The significant factors
   have been found with further discussion of their effect on the heat

Title = {{Gains tuning of a PI-Fuzzy controller by genetic algorithms}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{1074-1097}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Nowadays, in order to improve current applications, industry
   incorporates to their solution approaches artificial intelligence
   techniques and methodologies like Fuzzy Logic, neural networks and/or
   genetic algorithms (GA). Artificial intelligence techniques complement
   classical methodologies and include concepts that simulate the way
   humans solve problems or how processes work in nature. In this work, the
   Fuzzy Logic system cancels the effects of load perturbances in an energy
   plant, by implementing a secondary controller which complements the main
   controller. The purpose of this paper is to use GA to tune this new
   secondary controller. The authors particularize the proposal for three
   specific applications: control the angular speed and position of a
   Direct Current (DC) motor and control the output voltage of a DC/DC buck
   converter.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors use GA for tuning a
   Proportional-Integral Fuzzy Controller (PI-Fuzzy). The proposal defines
   a new objective function in comparison with literature approaches. The
   main key in the new objective function is combining the best features of
   Integral Square Error (ISE) function and taking out the overshoot
   response.
   Findings - In order to demonstrate the proposed methodology based on GA
   tuning a PI-Fuzzy, the authors apply the literature benchmark to the
   solution. The results are compared with the following techniques: Robust
   control, continuous PID control, discrete PID control, Optimal Control,
   Fuzzy Control and Artificial Neural Network based control. Comparisons
   are presented in terms of setting time and overshot.
   Originality/value - Results demonstrate that ISE or integral of absolute
   value of error function do not provide the desired response. Achieved
   results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposal to eliminate the
   overshoot of the traditional behaviour without lost any of the main
   features of the literature methodologies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on predicting academically at-risk
   engineering students at the early stage of their education. For this
   purpose, some soft computing tools namely support vectors machines and
   artificial neural networks have been employed. The study population
   included all students enrolled in Pamukkale University, Faculty of
   Engineering at 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 academic years as freshmen. The
   data are retrieved from various institutions and questionnaires
   conducted on the students. Each input data point is of 38-dimension,
   which includes demographic and academic information about the students,
   while the output based on the first-year GPA of the students falls into
   either at-risk or not. The results of the study have shown that either
   support vector machine or artificial neural network methods can be used
   to predict first-year performance of a student in a priori manner. Thus,
   a proper course load and graduation schedule can be transcribed for the
   student to manage their graduation in a way that potential dropout risks
   are reduced. Moreover, an input sensitivity analysis has been conducted
   to determine the importance of each input used in the study.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering design is a knowledge intensive process. Experts'
   experiences from different product life-cycle stages play a key role in
   problem solving during design decision making by linking up knowledge to
   find better solutions for a specific design problem. Different
   approaches have been used to support Collaborative and Concurrent
   Product Design, such as Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) modelling.
   Additionally, due to the need of capitalizing these experiences, the Set
   of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS) is used to store and manage
   experiences of decision making process. However it was necessary to
   adapt the structure to property manage the constraints approach used in
   Engineering Design. This article presents a proposed adaptation to SOEKS
   structure in order to be able to store and reuse CSP design experiences
   for further re-use and analysis of multiple experiences. Finally, a case
   study is presented in order to show how the proposed approach can be
   used in the industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the performance of an indoor Wireless Local Area Network

   test, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used. Access Points (APs) and
   receiver coordinates are determined as ANN input parameters and optimum
   Receive Signal Strength (RSS) have been sought. For WLAN design, the
   Genetic Algorithm (GA) method is used. Wall structures and AP properties
   are taken into account to obtain optimum Receive Signal Strengths
   (RSSs). For the analytic solution of the optimum RSS, the indoor setting
   is divided into cellular areas. Thus, the most suitable locations for
   APs and the number of APs are determined. As a result, we have tested
   the performance of a WLAN, which is installed by means of traditional
   methods. According the experimental results, the indoor WLAN designed
   with the GA method has provided better performance.}},

Abstract = {{Human activity recognition is a prerequisite for many innovative
   applications including elderly activity monitoring and support in order
   to enable elderly people to live longer independently in their own

   recognition approaches has been developed from which the majority
   focuses on the processing of data from one sensor modality only (e.g.,
   vision). Nonetheless, a merging of data from multiple disparate sources
   has the potential of offering more accurate, robust, descriptive,
   intuitive, and meaningful results due to the availability of
   complementary and partially redundant information. This article (1)
   gives a review of existing multimodal approaches for elderly activity
   recognition in home settings, (2) introduces a powerful activity
   recognition model based on brain-inspired multimodal data mining
   methods, (3) employs this model for the purpose of daily activity
   recognition in a home setting using a publically available real world

   in grid computing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT \& FUZZY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{187-199}},
Abstract = {{A grid computing environment provides a type of distributed computation
   that is unique because it is not centrally managed and it has the
   capability to connect heterogeneous resources. A grid system provides
   location-independent access to the resources and services of
   geographically distributed machines. An essential ingredient for
   supporting location-independent computations is the ability to discover
   resources that have been requested by the users. Because the number of
   grid users can increase and the grid environment is continuously
   changing, a scheduler that can discover decentralized resources is
   needed. Grid resource scheduling is considered to be a complicated,
   NP-hard problem because of the distribution of resources, the changing
   conditions of resources, and the unreliability of infrastructure
   communication. Various artificial intelligence algorithms have been
   proposed for scheduling tasks in a computational grid. This paper uses
   the imperialist competition algorithm (ICA) to address the problem of
   independent task scheduling in a grid environment, with the aim of
   reducing the makespan. Experimental results compare ICA with other
   algorithms and illustrate that ICA finds a shorter makespan relative to
   the others. Moreover, it converges quickly, finding its optimum solution
   in less time than the other algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm is a swarm
   intelligence-based nature inspired algorithm, which has been proved a

   capabilities of ABC, this paper presents an adaptive version of ABC. In
   this adaptive version, step size in solution modification and ABC
   parameter `limit' are set adaptively based on current fitness values. In
   the present self-adaptive ABC, good solutions are appointed to exploit
   the search region in their neighbourhood, while worse solutions are
   appointed to explore the search region. The better solutions are given
   higher chances to update themselves with the help of parameter `limit',
   which changes adaptively in the present study. The experiments on 16
   unbiased test problems of different complexities show that the proposed
   strategy outperforms the basic ABC and some recent variants of ABC.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by swarm intelligence observed in social species, the
   artificial self-organized networking (SON) systems are expected to
   exhibit some intelligent features (e. g., flexibility, robustness,
   decentralized control, and self-evolution, etc.) that may have made
   social species so successful in the biosphere. Self-organized networks
   with swarm intelligence as one possible solution have attracted a lot of
   attention from both academia and industry. In this paper, we survey
   different aspects of bio-inspired mechanisms and examine various
   algorithms that have been applied to artificial SON systems. The
   existing well-known bio-inspired algorithms such as pulse-coupled
   oscillators (PCO)-based synchronization, ant- and/or bee-inspired
   cooperation and division of labor, immune systems inspired network
   security and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)-based multipath routing have
   been surveyed and compared. The main contributions of this survey
   include 1) providing principles and optimization approaches of variant
   bio-inspired algorithms, 2) surveying and comparing critical SON issues
   from the perspective of physical-layer, Media Access Control (MAC)-layer
   and network-layer operations, and 3) discussing advantages, drawbacks,
   and further design challenges of variant algorithms, and then
   identifying their new directions and applications. In consideration of
   the development trends of communications networks (e. g., large-scale,
   heterogeneity, spectrum scarcity, etc.), some open research issues,
   including SON designing tradeoffs, Self-X capabilities in the 3rd
   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution
   (LTE)/LTE-Advanced systems, cognitive machine-to-machine (M2M)
   self-optimization, cross-layer design, resource scheduling, and power
   control, etc., are also discussed in this survey.}},

Abstract = {{Recent industry requires efficient fault discovering and isolation
   solutions in process equipment service. This problem is a real-world
   problem of typically ill-defined systems, hard to model, with
   large-scale solution spaces. Design of precise models is impractical,
   too expensive, or often non-existent. Support service of equipment
   requires generating models that can analyze the equipment data,
   interpreting the past behavior and predicting the future one. These
   problems pose a challenge to traditional modeling techniques and
   represent a great opportunity for the application of AI-based
   methodologies, which enable us to deal with imprecise, uncertain data
   and incomplete domain knowledge typically encountered in real-world
   applications. In this paper the state of the art, theoretical background
   of conventional and AI-based techniques in support of service tasks and
   illustration of some applications to process equipment service on
   bio-ethanol production process are shortly described.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental concerns due to emissions from nuclear and fossil fuel
   based power plants have triggered widespread utilization of renewable
   energy-based small-and large-scale distributed generation technologies.
   These technologies have been transforming the energy market towards a
   deregulated and dispersed entity. To cope with these transformations,
   and ensure appropriate grid monitoring and control, the conventional
   power grids across the globe have been enduring a paradigm shift towards
   a smart grid that is empowered with cutting edge technologies. The
   operational stability of these emerging smart power grids necessitates
   sophisticated real-time monitoring and control technologies. This
   article analyzes various stability concerns in smart power grids
   pertaining to distributed generations and proposes novel methodologies
   for ensuring operational stability. The proposed methodologies entail
   real-time stability monitoring and stability control with the use of
   wide-area synchrophasor measurements and artificial intelligence
   methods. The efficacy of the proposed methodologies has been verified
   through simulation studies conducted on an IEEE 14-bus system. Results
   of this research validate the necessity of coordinated control for
   maintaining stability of smart grids incorporating distributed

Abstract = {{In this paper, two well-known artificial intelligence techniques,
   artificial neural network (ANN) and upport vector machine (SVM) have
   been modelled for fault type classification for a transmission line
   equipped with thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) to compare
   their performance. Due to the non-linear changes introduced by the
   compensation devices, protection of the series compensated transmission
   line has been a difficult task. The problem is still complex for
   advanced series compensated transmission lines. The relaying procedure
   for a compensated transmission line usually involves fault type
   identification and fault section identification to conclude for the
   final decision. The algorithm modelled in this paper has been devised on
   the analysis of a half cycle post-fault current signals, with the help
   of discrete wavelet transform as a feature extraction tool. The training
   and testing of ANN and SVM have been performed with an identical fault
   data set for comparison. The accuracy of the classifiers had been tested
   with a large number of fault cases encircling different system
   conditions and fault conditions. These system conditions are simulated
   on Power System Computer Aided Design/ElectroMagnetic Transients Program
   (PSCAD/EMTP) with variation in system parameters such as change in
   firing angle of TCSC, fault resistance, fault inception angle, loading
   angle of generator, and source impedance variation for all 10 types of
   faults. The classifiers are compared in detail with their performance at
   various firing angles of TCSC and for different fault types.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the development of artificial intelligence ( AI) is a

   by proposing a decomposition schema for classifying them. Then it

   improving them. These tools are demonstrated by careful analysis of five
   famous AI predictions: the initial Dartmouth conference, Dreyfus's
   criticism of AI, Searle's Chinese room paper, Kurzweil's predictions in
   the Age of Spiritual Machines, and Omohundro's `AI drives' paper. These
   case studies illustrate several important principles, such as the
   general overconfidence of experts, the superiority of models over expert
   judgement and the need for greater uncertainty in all types of
   predictions. The general reliability of expert judgement in AI timeline
   predictions is shown to be poor, a result that fits in with previous

Abstract = {{Rational agents are usually built to maximise rewards. However,

   which rewards are used only to bootstrap hierarchical value learning.
   The modified AIXI agent is considered in the multi-agent environment,
   where other agents can be either humans or other `mature' agents, the
   values of which should be revealed and adopted by the `infant' AGI
   agent. Ageneral framework for designing such empathic agent with ethical

   well. Moreover, we perform experiments in the simple Markov environment,

Abstract = {{Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-established paradigm of
   declarative programming in close relationship with other declarative
   formalisms such as SAT Modulo Theories, Constraint Handling Rules,
   FO(.), PDDL and many others. Since its first informal editions, ASP
   systems have been compared in the now well-established ASP Competition.
   The Third (Open) ASP Competition, as the sequel to the ASP Competitions
   Series held at the University of Potsdam in Germany (2006-2007) and at
   the University of Leuven in Belgium in 2009, took place at the
   University of Calabria (Italy) in the first half of 2011. Participants
   competed on a pre-selected collection of benchmark problems, taken from
   a variety of domains as well as real world applications. The Competition
   ran on two tracks: the Model and Solve (M\&S) Track, based on an open
   problem encoding, and open language, and open to any kind of system
   based on a declarative specification paradigm; and the System Track, run
   on the basis of fixed, public problem encodings, written in a standard
   ASP language. This paper discusses the format of the competition and the
   rationale behind it, then reports the results for both tracks.
   Comparison with the second ASP competition and state-of-the-art
   solutions for some of the benchmark domains is eventually discussed.}},

Abstract = {{At present, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely used due to their
   low-cost devices and its easy deployment. Such networks have an
   important constraint: WSNs are particularly sensitive to energy
   consumption. This paper focuses on how to add routers to a previously
   established static WSN to simultaneously optimize two important
   features: energy consumption and covered area. This np-hard
   multi-objective optimization problem was solved by evolutionary
   computation, considering two well-known multi-objective genetic
   algorithms (NSGA-II and SPEA2), and a multi-objective adaptation of a
   novel swarm intelligence algorithm based on the behaviour of an
   artificial bee colony (ABC). The results obtained are analyzed in depth
   by means of a widely used statistical methodology that considers two
   multi-objective quality indicators: hypervolume and set coverage. We
   conclude that ABC provides better performance than standards NSGA-II and
   SPEA2. In addition, a comparative study is added where the gains in
   fitness values from including relay nodes are shown.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a collection of smart sensor nodes
   cooperated together for achieving the desire of the assigned
   application. However, these nodes suffer from different limitations,
   including limited energy sources and limited processing capabilities.
   Clustering and data aggregation are considered main solutions for
   prolonging the network lifetime. Clustering is either based on
   probabilistic models or on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such
   as fuzzy logic (FL). Clustering-based probabilistic models in most of
   the cases lead to inefficient distribution of cluster heads to cover all
   nodes in the field. At the same time, most of the current fuzzy-based
   clustering schemes assume that nodes are aware of their geographical
   location for their operation. On the other hand, most of the current
   aggregation protocols do not exploit the redundancy and the highly
   correlated reported values by the nearly deployed nodes. In addition,
   multimodal nodes, nodes that sense multiple features at the same time,
   are not considered, up to our knowledge, in any of the current
   aggregation algorithms. Our contribution in this paper is twofold: (i)
   introducing fuzzy-based clustering technique that takes node's residual
   energy, density and number of features sensed in multimodal WSNs and
   (ii) proposing a novel data aggregation technique-based fuzzy score to
   identify the uniqueness/importance of the reported data. Our proposed
   algorithms are compared to some of the current clustering and
   aggregation algorithms with different WSN settings.}},

Abstract = {{The computation amount in blind source separation based on bioinspired
   intelligence optimization is high. In order to solve this problem, we
   propose an effective blind source separation algorithm based on the
   artificial bee colony algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, the
   covariance ratio of the signals is utilized as the objective function
   and the artificial bee colony algorithm is used to solve it. The source
   signal component which is separated out, is then wiped off from mixtures
   using the deflation method. All the source signals can be recovered
   successfully by repeating the separation process. Simulation experiments
   demonstrate that significant improvement of the computation amount and
   the quality of signal separation is achieved by the proposed algorithm
   when compared to previous algorithms.}},

Journal = {{AI COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{275-283}},
Abstract = {{Whilst common sense knowledge has been well researched in terms of
   intelligence and (in particular) artificial intelligence, specific,
   factual knowledge also plays a critical part in practice. When it comes
   to testing for intelligence, testing for factual knowledge is, in
   every-day life, frequently used as a front line tool. This paper
   presents new results which were the outcome of a series of practical
   Turing tests held on 23rd June 2012 at Bletchley Park, England. The
   focus of this paper is on the employment of specific knowledge testing
   by interrogators. Of interest are prejudiced assumptions made by
   interrogators as to what they believe should be widely known and
   subsequently the conclusions drawn if an entity does or does not appear
   to know a particular fact known to the interrogator. The paper is not at
   all about the performance of machines or hidden humans but rather the
   strategies based on assumptions of Turing test interrogators. Full,
   unedited transcripts from the tests are shown for the reader as working
   examples. As a result, it might be possible to draw critical conclusions
   with regard to the nature of human concepts of intelligence, in terms of
   the role played by specific, factual knowledge in our understanding of
   intelligence, whether this is exhibited by a human or a machine. This is
   specifically intended as a position paper, firstly by claiming that
   practicalising Turing's test is a useful exercise throwing light on how
   we humans think, and secondly, by taking a potentially controversial
   stance, because some interrogators adopt a solipsist questioning style
   of hidden entities with a view that it is a thinking intelligent human
   if it thinks like them and knows what they know. The paper is aimed at
   opening discussion with regard to the different aspects considered.}},

Abstract = {{In European countries, the last decade has been characterized by a
   deregulation of power production and electricity became a commodity
   exchanged in proper markets. This resulted in an increasing interest of
   the scientific community on electricity exchanges for modeling both
   market activity and price process. This paper analyzes electricity
   spot-prices of the Italian Power Exchange (IPEX) and proposes three
   different methods to model prices time series: a discrete-time
   univariate econometric model (ARMA-GARCH) and two
   computational-intelligence techniques (Neural Network and Support Vector
   Machine). Price series exhibit a strong daily seasonality, addressed by
   analyzing separately a series for each of the 24 hours. One-day ahead
   forecasts of hourly prices have been considered so to compare the
   prediction performances of three different methods, with respect to the
   canonical benchmark model based on the random walk hypothesis. Results
   point out that Support Vector Machine methodology gives better
   forecasting accuracy for price time series, closely followed by the
   econometric technique.}},

Abstract = {{One of the challenging problems in artificial intelligence is credit
   assignment which simply means distributing the credit among a group,
   such as a group of agents. We made an attempt to meet this problem with
   the aid of the reinforcement learning paradigm. In this paper,
   expertness framework is defined and applied to the multi-agent credit
   assignment problem. In the expertness framework, the critic agent, who
   is responsible for distributing credit among agents, is equipped with
   learning capability, and the proposed credit assignment solution is
   based on the critic to learn to assign a proportion of the credit to
   each agent, and the used proportion should be learned by reinforcement
   learning. The paper also reports the degree of expertness framework
   robustness and the amount of performance decline in noisy environments.
   Experimental results show the superiority of the method over the common
   methods of credit assignment used in lots of different domains and also
   show that performance reduction with respect to the quantity of the
   noise is tolerable and the system ultimately converges to the stable and
   correct behavior, therefore the agents are still capable of efficiently
   performing in the noisy environments.}},

Abstract = {{Because of high speed, efficiency, robustness and flexibility of
   multi-agent systems, in recent years there has been an increasing

   one of the well-known negotiation multi-agent protocols in multi-agent
   systems. In this paper artificial capital market as a new variant of
   market mechanism is introduced and employed in a multi-robot foraging
   problem. In this artificial capital market, the robots are going to
   benefit via investment on some assets, defined as doing foraging task.
   Each investment has a cost and an outcome. Limited initial capital of
   the investors constrains their investments. A negotiation protocol is
   proposed for decision making of the agents. Qualitative analysis reveals
   speed of convergence, near optimal solutions and robustness of the
   algorithm. Numerical analysis shows advantages of the proposed method
   over two previously developed heuristics in terms of four performance

Abstract = {{Route planning is an important problem for many real-time applications
   in open and complex environments. The maritime domain is a relevant
   example of such environments where dynamic phenomena and navigation
   constraints generate difficult route finding problems. This paper
   develops a spatial data structure that supports the search for an
   optimal route between two locations while minimizing a cost function.
   Although various search algorithms have been proposed so far (e.g.
   breadth-first search, bidirectional breadth-first search, Dijkstra's
   algorithm, A({*}), etc.), this approach provides a bidirectional dynamic
   routing algorithm which is based on hexagonal meshes and an iterative
   deepening A({*}) (IDA({*})) algorithm, and a front to front strategy
   using a dynamic graph that facilitates data accessibility. The whole
   approach is applied to the context of maritime navigation, taking into
   account navigation hazards and restricted areas. The algorithm developed
   searches for optimal routes while minimizing distance and computational
   time.}},

Title = {{Path-Wise Test Data Generation Based on Heuristic Look-Ahead Methods}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Path-wise test data generation is generally considered an important
   problem in the automation of software testing. In essence, it is a
   constraint optimization problem, which is often solved by search methods
   such as backtracking algorithms. In this paper, the backtracking
   algorithm branch and bound and state space search in artificial
   intelligence are introduced to tackle the problem of path-wise test data
   generation. The former is utilized to explore the space of potential
   solutions and the latter is adopted to construct the search tree
   dynamically. Heuristics are employed in the look-ahead stage of the
   search. Dynamic variable ordering is presented with a heuristic rule to
   break ties, values of a variable are determined by the monotonicity
   analysis on branching conditions, and maintaining path consistency is
   achieved through analysis on the result of interval arithmetic. An
   optimization method is also proposed to reduce the search space. The
   results of empirical experiments show that the search is conducted in a
   basically backtrack-free manner, which ensures both test data generation
   with promising performance and its excellence over some currently
   existing static and dynamic methods in terms of coverage. The results
   also demonstrate that the proposed method is applicable in engineering.}},

Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORK WORLD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},

Pages = {{193-210}},
Abstract = {{Brace diaphragm walls are commonly used in underground structures in
   metropolitan areas, where avoiding costly damage to adjacent
   infrastructure / buildings is critical to project success. It is
   necessary to make accurate diaphragm wall deflection predictions to
   ensure actual deflection falls within allowable limits, and thus ensure
   the safety of both the project and adjacent structures. Numerous studies
   and approaches, such as empirical, semi-empirical as well as numerical
   approaches, have addressed excavation-induced deflection in diaphragm
   walls. Artificial intelligence (Al) has been used recently by several
   researchers to improve diaphragm wall deflection prediction
   capabilities. This paper proposes a hybrid artificial intelligence
   system, namely the evolutionary fuzzy support vector machine inference
   model for time series data (EFSIMT), to predict diaphragm wall
   deflection in deep excavation through the application of historical
   project data. Simulations were performed on 1,083 instances, segregated
   into a total of 988 training data sets and 95 test data sets. Validation
   results show that the EFSIMT achieves higher performance in comparison
   with Artificial Neural Networks and the Evolutionary Support Vector
   Machine Inference Model (ESIM). Therefore, EFSIMT has great potential as
   a predictive tool for diaphragm wall deflection problems and assisting
   project managers/engineers to ensure safety during the construction
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Using the referencing patterns in articles in Cognitive Science over

   and (C) reintegration into ``cognitive psychology{''} in the 2000s. The
   fluidity and fuzziness of the interdisciplinary delineations in the
   different visualizations can be reduced and clarified using factor
   analysis. We also explore newly available routines ({''}CorText{''}) to
   analyze this development in terms of ``tubes{''} using an alluvial map
   and compare the results with an animation (using ``Visone{''}). The
   historical specificity of this development can be compared with the

Abstract = {{Essay writing is widely used for student performance assessment. This
   paper presents a hybrid automatic essay scoring system (AES) for Arabic
   essays. The system attempts at saving the time teachers spend on reading
   and scoring Arabic essays. It utilizes latent semantic analysis (LSA)
   and three linguistic features (i.e., word stemming, number of words and
   number of spelling mistakes). This paper also describes an algorithm to
   determine the optimal reduced dimensionality used in LSA. To evaluate
   the performance of this system, an Arabic dataset was developed based on
   essays collected from college students. The experimental results show
   the effectiveness of using LSA for scoring Arabic essays, especially
   when combined with other linguistic features. The system shows that
   96.72\% of the test data are correctly scored and the correlation
   between automatic and manual scores is 0.78, which is close to the
   interhuman correlation of 0.7.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, a new planar spiral antenna for passive radio frequency

   optimized using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. The
   optimization goals are antenna size minimization, gain maximization,

   range. The antenna dimensions were optimized and evaluated using ABC in
   conjunction with commercial electromagnetic (EM) software. The
   comparison of the results obtained by ABC to respective ones of other
   popular evolutionary algorithms show that ABC can be efficiently applied
   to tag antenna design problems. To validate the theoretical results,
   designed RFID tags were fabricated, and their reading efficiency was
   evaluated experimentally. The results of simulation and those received
   via measurements prove that the proposed method for the design of
   passive RFID tag antennas is efficient, as antennas with dimensions less
   than 3 cm, gain that reaches the value of 1.6 dBi, and read range about
   6 m were obtained. Index Terms-Artificial bee colony optimization,

Title = {{Multiobjective RFID Network Optimization Using Multiobjective
   Evolutionary and Swarm Intelligence Approaches}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The development of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology
   generates the most challenging RFID network planning (RNP) problem,
   which needs to be solved in order to operate the large-scale RFID
   network in an optimal fashion. RNP involves many objectives and
   constraints and has been proven to be a NP-hard multi-objective problem.
   The application of evolutionary algorithm (EA) and swarm intelligence
   (SI) for solving multiobjective RNP (MORNP) has gained significant
   attention in the literature, but these algorithms always transform
   multiple objectives into a single objective by weighted coefficient
   approach. In this paper, we use multiobjective EA and SI algorithms to
   find all the Pareto optimal solutions and to achieve the optimal
   planning solutions by simultaneously optimizing four conflicting
   objectives in MORNP, instead of transforming multiobjective functions
   into a single objective function. The experiment presents an exhaustive
   comparison of three successful multiobjective EA and SI, namely, the
   recently developed multiobjective artificial bee colony algorithm
   (MOABC), the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), and
   the multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), on MORNP
   instances of different nature, namely, the two-objective and
   three-objective MORNP. Simulation results show that MOABC proves to be
   more superior for planning RFID networks than NSGA-II and MOPSO in terms
   of optimization accuracy and computation robustness.}},

Title = {{Developing a sensor-based learning concentration detection system}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{216-230}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to use sensing technology to observe the
   learning status of learners in a teaching and learning environment In a
   general instruction environment, teachers often encounter some teaching
   problems. These are frequently related to the fact that the teacher
   cannot clearly know the learning status of students, such as their
   degree of learning concentration and capacity to absorb knowledge. In
   order to deal with this situation, this study uses a learning
   concentration detection system (LCDS), combining sensor technology and
   an artificial intelligence method, to better understand the learning
   concentration of students in a learning environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed system uses sensing
   technology to collect information about the learning behavior of the
   students, analyzes their concentration levels, and applies an artificial
   intelligence method to combine this information for use by the teacher.
   This system includes a pressure detection sensor and facial detection
   sensor to detect facial expressions, eye activities and body movements.
   The system utilizes an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to optimize
   the system performance to help teachers immediately understand the
   degree of concentration and learning status of their students. Based on
   this, instructors can give appropriate guidance to several unfocused
   students at the same time.
   Findings - The fitness value and computation time were used to evaluate
   the LCDS. Comparing the results of the proposed ABC algorithm with those
   from the random search method, the algorithm was found to obtain better
   solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the ABC algorithm
   can quickly obtain near optimal solutions within a reasonable time.
   Originality/value - A learning concentration detection method of
   integrating context-aware technologies and an ABC algorithm is presented
   in this paper. Using this learning concentration detection method,
   teachers can keep abreast of their students' learning status in a
   teaching environment and thus provide more appropriate instruction.}},

   induction motor parameter estimation}},
Journal = {{TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{620-636}},
Abstract = {{An induction motor is the most commonly used motor in industry today.
   Motor circuit parameters are essential for designing, evaluating
   performance, and controlling the applications of the motor. However, it
   is difficult to measure the electric parameters, e.g., resistance and
   reactance, of induction motors accurately. Therefore, researchers have
   noted the parameter estimation of induction motors as an essential
   optimization problem. The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is an
   efficient element of bioinspired optimization algorithms and has been
   successfully applied in numerous engineering applications. However, the
   ABC algorithm suffers from slow convergence and poor exploitation.
   Additionally, there are bleak chances of getting a fitter food source
   for scout bees using the the standard ABC algorithm scheme. Therefore,
   different solutions have already been proposed to avoid the flaws of the
   ABC algorithm. Nevertheless, the proposed solutions are either
   computationally intensive or prone to local optima traps or they require
   additional control variables to tune. Moreover, there is no systematic
   way to tune the additional control variables for yielding the optimal
   performance of the algorithms. Therefore, this research work proposes a
   novel variant of the ABC algorithm, which capitalizes on multiple
   global-best food sources rather than a single global-best food source.
   In addition, this research work proposes a novel scheme for enhancing
   the performance of the ABC algorithm's scout bee. Two modifications for
   the performance enhancement of the ABC algorithm are proposed in this
   research work. The proposed algorithm is compared with various recently
   proposed variants of the ABC algorithm and various other available
   methods for estimating induction motor parameters. The performance of
   the proposed algorithm is also assessed using the chaotic map
   initialization technique. The results prove that the proposed algorithm
   is able to achieve the best convergence among all of the compared
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Online portfolio selection is a fundamental problem in computational
   finance, which has been extensively studied across several research
   communities, including finance, statistics, artificial intelligence,
   machine learning, and data mining. This article aims to provide a
   comprehensive survey and a structural understanding of online portfolio
   selection techniques published in the literature. From an online machine
   learning perspective, we first formulate online portfolio selection as a
   sequential decision problem, and then we survey a variety of
   state-of-the-art approaches, which are grouped into several major
   categories, including benchmarks, Follow-the-Winner approaches,
   Follow-the-Loser approaches, Pattern-Matching-based approaches, and
   Meta-Learning Algorithms. In addition to the problem formulation and
   related algorithms, we also discuss the relationship of these algorithms
   with the capital growth theory so as to better understand the
   similarities and differences of their underlying trading ideas. This
   article aims to provide a timely and comprehensive survey for both
   machine learning and data mining researchers in academia and
   quantitative portfolio managers in the financial industry to help them
   understand the state of the art and facilitate their research and

Title = {{Ambient intelligence for quality of life assessment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND SMART ENVIRONMENTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{57-70}},
Abstract = {{We are often, consciously or unconsciously, self-assessing our quality
   of life in order to make decisions about our future actions. People with
   special needs are sometimes not able to perform this evaluation, this
   being the responsibility of their relatives or carers. The literature
   shows this to be a challenging task due to the inherent subjectivity,
   and the limited data collection tools and biased information available.
   This paper proposes that context awareness and artificial intelligence
   can support this task by providing digested and objective information
   about a person's quality of life evolution. Ambient Assisted Living
   continuously obtains relevant data from different sources such as
   sensors, the use of household appliances and interaction with user
   interfaces. An artificial neural network model known as self-organizing
   maps processes this data to monitor how the user carries out different
   activities of daily living (e. g. cooking or doing the washing). This
   information, together with statistical analysis from the said data, is
   automatically compiled by the system in a report to visualize trends in
   user behavior that might lead to the detection of a person's cognitive,
   physical or sensory deterioration. This report has been validated by a
   group of experts who considered it a tool of great usefulness and power
   to complement existing tools used by social workers.}},

Title = {{Cluster Analysis Based on Bipartite Network}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Clustering data has a wide range of applications and has attracted
   considerable attention in data mining and artificial intelligence.
   However it is difficult to find a set of clusters that best fits natural
   partitions without any class information. In this paper, a method for
   detecting the optimal cluster number is proposed. The optimal cluster
   number can be obtained by the proposal, while partitioning the data into
   clusters by FCM (Fuzzy c-means) algorithm. It overcomes the drawback of
   FCM algorithm which needs to define the cluster number.. in advance. The
   method works by converting the fuzzy cluster result into a weighted
   bipartite network and then the optimal cluster number can be detected by
   the improved bipartite modularity. The experimental results on
   artificial and real data sets show the validity of the proposed method.}},

   Descriptors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{The use of numerical parameters in Complex Network analysis is expanding
   to new fields of application. At a molecular level, we can use them to
   describe the molecular structure of chemical entities, protein
   interactions, or metabolic networks. However, the applications are not
   restricted to the world of molecules and can be extended to the study of
   macroscopic nonliving systems, organisms, or even legal or social
   networks. On the other hand, the development of the field of Artificial
   Intelligence has led to the formulation of computational algorithms
   whose design is based on the structure and functioning of networks of
   biological neurons. These algorithms, called Artificial Neural Networks
   (ANNs), can be useful for the study of complex networks, since the
   numerical parameters that encode information of the network (for example
   centralities/node descriptors) can be used as inputs for the ANNs. The
   Wiener index (W) is a graph invariant widely used in chemoinformatics to
   quantify the molecular structure of drugs and to study complex networks.
   In this work, we explore for the first time the possibility of using
   Markov chains to calculate analogues of node distance numbers/W to
   describe complex networks from the point of view of their nodes. These
   parameters are called Markov-Wiener node descriptors of order k(th)
   (W-k). Please, note that these descriptors are not related to
   Markov-Wiener stochastic processes. Here, we calculated the W-k(i)
   values for a very high number of nodes (>100,000) in more than 100
   different complex networks using the software MI-NODES. These networks
   were grouped according to the field of application. Molecular networks
   include the Metabolic Reaction Networks (MRNs) of 40 different
   organisms. In addition, we analyzed other biological and legal and
   social networks. These include the Interaction Web Database Biological
   Networks (IWDBNs), with 75 food webs or ecological systems and the
   Spanish Financial Law Network (SFLN). The calculated W-k(i) values were
   used as inputs for different ANNs in order to discriminate correct node
   connectivity patterns from incorrect random patterns. The MIANN models
   obtained present good values of Sensitivity/Specificity (\%): MRNs
   (78/78), IWDBNs (90/88), and SFLN (86/84). These preliminary results are
   very promising from the point of view of a first exploratory study and
   suggest that the use of these models could be extended to the
   high-throughput re-evaluation of connectivity in known complex networks
   (collation).}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the potential use of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy

   (LDA), Stepwise LDA (StepLDA), Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Gram-Schmidt
   supervised orthogonalization (SELECT)) were employed over the beer
   fingerprints obtained to characterize the aging stages as well as beer
   types. The selection of useful variables has been performed by means of
   SELECT, StepLDA, and GA. Based on the results, the two alcoholic beers
   and the two non-alcoholic beers heavily overlap but the aging treatments
   were clearly discriminated. However, the NIR coupled with the
   multivariate computational tools has demonstrated a good capability to
   discriminate and classify the aged beers satisfactorily in such a way,
   for all aging treatments, high classification accuracies were found. (C)
